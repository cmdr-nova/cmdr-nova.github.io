Stuff for pagination:

This is just a basic example that gets the pagination working
without the theme.

1. Added `jekyll-paginate` to plugins section in `_config.yml`

2. Added `paginate: 2` to `_config.yml`

3. Did *not* add `paginate_path` to `config.yml`

4. Renamed `/index.markdown` to `/index.html`

5. Added `/_layouts/home.html` with basic pagination example.
This overrides the theme. If memory serves, you can find and copy
the contents of the theme into this file and adjust it for 
the pagination. That should get you started.
