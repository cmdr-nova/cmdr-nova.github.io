    "content": "Welcome to the brand new REVOSA blog! REVOSA is a Second Life based business that specializes in scifi, fantasy, modern and vampire themed accessories, furniture, homes, vehicles and much more!\n\nSince this is my first post here on the REVOSA blog, I’m going to talk about all of the products I’ve \n\n\ndone this week, starting with the Bleeding Rose.\n\nThis Bleeding Rose is a 100% original mesh home decor accessory with a land impact of only one. The blood drip particle animation is also simple, and extremely low lag. You can check for yourself! This should be a good addition to any vampire’s home, or otherwise anyone who enjoys the darker side of life, or second life, for that matter.\n\nThe marketplace listing for this item can be found here.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to my next, not-so-bloody product, a transgender pride bracelet. I made this as a way to show my support for the transgender community, and to raise awareness for the plight of equal rights in the United States. As it stands today, the transgender community is currently, and still, one of the most marginalized communities in the world.\n\nIf you view the product page, there you can find even more information about the struggles that face the average transgender person. Show your support! At a cool 50 linden, it’s a steal anyway!\nMarketplace listing for the trans pride bracelet can be found here.\n\nNext up is one of my favorite products that I’ve done yet! This is dubbed “Tome of the Damned,” with an obvious vampire theme. The book, which is 100% original mesh, comes in its package with \n\n\nthree different versions. The first version is a simple prop, the book, which you can place anywhere that you please. The second version is a wearable book that your avatar will hug is if it were a cuddly teddy bear. And then the final version of this product comes with a bonus lectern stand with the book already attached! All versions of this product are only one land impact.\n\nThis product is one of many in a long line of vampire themed accessories I would like to make (including an entire turning altar). \n\nMarketplace listing for the Tome of the Damned is here.\n\n\n\nSecond to last on the list is another favorite product of mine, a remake of the very first item I ever made in Second life, the Kill Trophy Box. Although, the first version of this was made entirely out of prims and added up to about seven land impact (lol!), the new and improved version, celebrating 8 months of REVOSA, is only two land impact. Not only that, it comes with a low-lag open and close script. Simply click the lid and it will either open, or close depending on what state the box is currently in.\n\nBeing a big fan of the television show, Dexter, this was really fun to make, and I was surprised at what the final product came out as. The Kill Trophy Box can be found here.\n\nLast on this week’s list (or at least, so far) is a simple candelabra that I decided to make, which fits in quite well with the Tome of the Damned and Lectern. Alternatively, this would likely fit well in any\n\n\nvampire or dark fantasy setting. As with all of my items (or mostly all of them) this product is copy and modifiable. At a land impact of 6 this should be fine just about anywhere.\n\nThe flickering particle flames adorned at the top of each candle can be toggled on and off with a simple click of your mouse.\n\nREVOSA Candelabra is available for 75 linden here.\n\nAnd that just about wraps up my first post for this blog! Later I plan on writing another significantly large post about exactly how REVOSA came to be, where it started and where the exclusive Second Life business is now. As always, thank you for your interest in my products! Rev it up baby!\n\nInworld store: REVOSA Mainstore and Blood Bank\nMarketplace store: REVOSA Sex, Mesh, Murder\n"

    "content": "\n\nSo for the past day and a quarter now I’ve been working on my first serious piece of clothing for my store. It’s been a lot of re-topology, a lot of mesh cleanup, a lot of screwing around with frustrating UV maps and now I’m attempting to size it correctly.\n\nSince this is my first attempt at actually making something wearable, it’ll likely be priced on the low-end of the average clothing scale, and as I gain experience, prices will likely increase by a small margin.\n\nAs you can see, the mesh itself looks pretty clean, but if you bring up the wiremesh, it’s sort of messy. I’ve done what I believe I can do in order to clean it up as much as possible.\n\nThe next step I have to work through is resizing parts of the jacket itself, since, for some weird \n\n\nreason, it no longer fits the average avatar. The backside clips into the butt and the arms are too long, therefore cutting into the hands. The arms themselves clip into the avatar’s skin, but I’ll be creating an alpha to fix that problem.\n\nSince I use the Maitreya body on my avatar, I’ll be working to fit it best around this template, even though the Maitreya creators have yet to respond to my requests for the templates they use. So it’s basically guess work and lots of mesh stretching.\n\nAs for making clothing in general, since, at the moment, it’s a pretty long process for me, I’ll probably be building a clothing line rather slowly. I actually have a full line of things I was making in the past, but my biggest hurdle has always been weight painting. In theory, I don’t have to create anything else from scratch for a while, if I should go back and fix the twenty some outfits I’ve made!\n\nThat’s it for now though, aside from another product I’m working on which is much simpler than clothing… A vampire turning altar. This item is projected to be low land impact, but since I haven’t started much of it yet, I don’t have anything to show in regards to that product.\n\nBut as always, thank you for reading!\n\nMarketplace store: REVOSA Sex, Mesh, Murder\nInworld store.

All I’ve left to do is apply three or four textures and…figure out how to make a texture changing HUD! Because that’s something I’ve never been able to do before (didn’t know how), but for a product like this I believe it is totally necessary to have options.\n\nThe legs, of course, will be low-leg oriented and most likely priced around the range of 500 linden or so. My avatar is a Maitreya body, and as you can see from the photo, they mostly fit perfectly. I assume this means they’ll work with TMP and Slink, but I’ll have to make sure before I put the finishing touches on them.\n\nThat’s it for now! I’ll return later with, hopefully, a finishing product!\n\nInworld store: http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Pisces/172/239/29\nMarketplace store: https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/165186\n"

    "content": "Today, since I created a simpler product that didn’t take me eight hours to complete (lol), I wanted to post here on my blog a written history of where my Second Life business REVOSA originally started, and how I got to the point of selling nearly over a hundred different products in a myriad of categories, a three story mainstore on my own land and franchises all over the grid in a period of six months.\n\n\n\nBack toward the middle and end of 2014, when I was still super active in the furry community and sporting a fennec avatar, all under the name of FoxyMeryl, I was an avid club-goer, dancer and club host for ::FRISSON:: with a house in the sky that I paid for mostly out-of-pocket. During this time, I had no idea that I could really make any kind of actual money in Second Life. For me it was just something to do in my free time to, you know, kill time.\n\nThat was until I was forced to stop hosting due to unfortunate circumstances, but one day when I was exploring one of the many furry sims, I saw a store and an ad for “custom tuners” and I was intrigued. Up until that point, I hadn’t heard of anything like this in Second Life.\n\nSo of course I ordered myself a custom car, and met the person who was building. We grew close to \n\n\neach other and eventually ended up in a Second Life relationship, which is right around the time that I made myself a little company called “Greasfox,” where I took empty car shells and built them into tuners (as I learned how to do so, in-part to my partner at the time and her help) and then sold them on the marketplace.\n\nOccasionally, I’d get custom car requests. This made me a small amount of money on a weekly basis. We’re talking small amount of lindens, and then what I made I spent on clothing or furry stuff. \n\nGreasfox moved from a parcel and a cheap garage to my partner’s Homestead sim where I setup shop, but Greasfox only lasted for about a month or so, before my partner and I decided to merge our existing businesses into one that would be called Full Carbon.\n\n\n\nFull Carbon started in the same way that both of our businesses were being run. We built cars from empty shells and took custom requests, eventually moving from the homestead to a private parcel with a house and a garage.\n\nThis particular phase lasted for a month or so while we made a little more money than, at least, I was used to making.\n\nI think this was around the time that I saw the real potential that Second Life had, and what I could possibly do in order to support myself and my real life endeavors.\n\nHaving made enough money to move from our cheaper place, we bought a third of a sim and built a space station that became quite popular among the drift (a form of racing) team we’d started, which is called Moxie Drift Team, still, to this day (as is Full Carbon, a now registered trademark).\n\nThe idea was that we’d build cars on this station where we’d setup a mainstore and a scifi roleplay hangout area. We attracted more visitors than we were used to, but this was lucrative for our business at the time.\n\nThe station, though, the Infinitum SR2, this was something that I held dearly (and am tentatively rebuilding on my own to sell as a mesh skybox). It was my dream in Second Life, at that moment in time, to virtually live on a station in space and run my own roleplay community. Unfortunately though, like many things, this station’s life came to an eventual end, as did my relationship with my partner after six months, a third iteration of the space station itself and an attempt to fix what we had, which was far beyond repair. As it turns out, mixing business and romance is a recipe for disaster.\n\n\n\nOn the days that followed the end of our relationship, I lost my ties to Full Carbon, Full Carbon Auto and Moxie Drift Team altogether, but that’s okay, because I was starting something new, anyway.\n\nAfter revamping my marketplace store to be less reflective of the previous business I’d been involved with and something new that I was cooking up, I rented a small parcel and setup a garage type loft apartment. Here I began work on, once again, custom tuner cars that I would slap inside of boxes and sell on a table outside of my apartment (which I also listed in the SL search database haha).\n\nThis business of mine came to be called REVosa, which was around the same point in time that I abandoned the idea of using furry avatars and silently removed myself from that community (mostly, besides the friends that I still have within it) due to many different personal reasons.\n\nAs I built my new business, which would only have direct ties to myself (in order to ensure that I \n\n\nwould never lose the rights to my work again), I met a new friend (wink, wink) who would help me both with my personal parcel and a fledgling mainstore in the Pisces region (where it still exists today). Getting quite exhausted with making cars, I opened up Blender one day earlier this year and began to screw around with shapes, which morphed into a month of teaching myself (with a little help from friends) how to use this particular 3D modeling software and what I could do with it.\n\nFrom that point in May, 2015, up to where we are now, I filled my store with many different nick-nacks and fun little things, learned how to design clothing and learned how to weight paint and rig clothing for Second Life.\n\nBy the time we hit September 2015, I’d have sold enough products to fund my shop without real world influence (besides my skill in Blender and my aforementioned friend, now also business partner) and have managed to seed many very small shops in the name of my business, through 40% profit affiliate vendors. I even have my own streaming radio spot running! (Listen here: https://soundcloud.com/lulavauss/revosa-ad1)\n\nIt’s been six months since I started REVOSA, and although my shop, my business aren’t as big as some of the others out there that have been running for a much longer period of time, I know that REVOSA will lead the way. What an interesting time it’s been in what, only a year ago, was what I considered to be a pretty dull virtual world without much in the way of things to do (I was wrong, very wrong).\n\nAnd, even though the Infinitum SR2 and SR3 are gone, for now, there’s always Afterlife, club, bar and hangout, a brand new place that I manage (and am currently attempting to drive traffic into).\n\nBut that’s it for now. REV it up, baby.\n\n-ℒula ℒaValette  (merylimperil)\n\nMarketplace store: https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/165186\n\nInworld store: http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Pisces/172/239/29\n\n"

Why, though, am I not working? For one, I sent in a process credit on my Second Life account on Saturday and it’s being stalled four days later for unscheduled maintenance on the entire billing system, which also means any sales I could be making are currently not happening.\n\nI also applied for the TMP dev kit earlier last week and am currently waiting to receive the email and the kit so that I can get to work on lipstick, eyeshadow, liner and more. But, as it always goes, this is a waiting game, and since I’ve signed up with them for exclusive makeup, I can’t exactly go and make a bunch of system layer makeup (which I’d have to convert later anyway).\n\nAnd then I’m also waiting on the Maitreya dev kit so that I can perfect system layer clothing, and maybe create specialized versions of all my mesh clothing specifically for Maitreya.\n\n\n\nWhat this means is, basically, my production is halted while I simply wait. On everything. But maybe it’s best I take a day and focus on some other things.\n\nOne good thing has come of all of this though! Just a few hours ago I decided to sponsor Making Strides Against Breast Cancer at my inworld store with a donation kiosk, a promise desk, and a cheap little hunt item that, for twenty linden, will give you my newest “Pink Explosion” nails (for Maitreya)! Proceeds, of course, go directly toward the fundraiser. Stop by my store here and check it out!\n\nWith all of that aside, I really have no idea what I’d like to work on today besides maybe relaxing a little bit… or maybe the cybernetic arms I plan to release for the holiday season? We’ll see!\n"

    "content": "\n\nWay back like almost a year ago, when I was still under the company name “Full Carbon” I had created an energy drink named “Moxie Energy” which became a drift race team name and signature drink of the aforementioned business.\n\nUpon the split with my previous business partner and the rights loss to Full Carbon, I also lost the work I’d done on my first energy drink. So as a response to that seven months ago when I started this business, I made an energy drink called “REVosa Energy” which was actually part of how I even named my new business, and since have included a free copy of the drink with nearly every single product listed in my store.\n\nNow, after all this time, I’ve decided to update the drink with brand new mesh and high resolution \n\n\ntextures. Not only that, but when attached to your avatar it plays a snap and fizz sound, at which your avatar will sip the drink for two minutes before it automatically detaches! To go alone with this, I made a vending machine by hand (that’s only one land impact!) and loaded up with an infinite amount of my signature drink.\n\nThe vending machine itself plays a low humming ambient sound for realism and when clicked it plays a scifi-esque sound that can only be described as a beaming of sorts, as if it’s beaming the drink into your pocket! And now, for 79 linden, you can have this vending machine all to yourself (marketplace link)! Put it in your club, your bar, your hangout, your home, wherever! Your day hasn’t started until you’ve had your caffeine, and now you can have it right at your fingertips.\n\nI will also be including the new and improved drink with every product I make from this point forward, as usual.\n\nAnd if you’re reading this, don’t forget to stop by the store today and slap the MM board! Your ride is right here. Have a wonderful Sunday.\n"

Currently there is a small piece of the first chapter on display and ready to read. “The End of Everything” chapter 1.2 is coming soon as a continuation to the beginning of the novel that will redefine #thepaxseries in every possible way.\n\nLeave comments, tell me what you think and most importantly, enjoy!\n"

So if you’ve read Escape Velocity and you’re dying to know just what the hell happens next, you can now not only find out where we are in the story, but how (sort of) we got there.\n\nStay tuned for chapter 3, “Transmission From Hell.”\n\nClick here to start at the beginning of chapter 2, or here to start from chapter 1.\n"

This signal came to be named the “Wow!” signal and is a real thing you can listen to on youtube, here.\n\nAs Jennfier, the ships A.I. intercepts a strange signal that is assumed to have slipped over the event horizon, she discovers that this signal was being broadcast at 1420 megahertz, and that not only is it a distress signal, but likely the same signal that was discovered in the seventies, way back on Earth before everything died.\n\nHow?\n\nYou tell me.\n\nCome check out the new NETHERBOUND index page here on Tumblr where you can easily select chapters to read, including the newly released and finished chapter, “Transmission From Hell.”\n"

    "content": "I know, I know. It’s been a little bit of a long time coming, but I have an explanation. There are explanations for everything. While I was in the middle of writing chapter four, Fallout 4 released! This was pretty awesome, because the game is amazing. But I won’t go into detail about that because it isn’t entirely important to this update, nor is the fact that I also went through most of the main campaign in New Vegas, started playing Elder Scrolls Online (Add @paxcorpus if you like) again and am slowly working my way through Alien: Isolation (An amazing entry into the franchise).\n\nHaving burned myself out from 3D modeling, I decided to take a little break, and now that my head is sort of in the right place, I’ve finished chapter four of NETHERBOUND and am preparing to head into chapter five, rightly titled Jack of Spades.\n\nChapter four details a death-defying space walk within the already mentioned black hole where our ship, the Tredecim is hanging, suspended in hyperspace. You can read the whole chapter, and the rest of the rough draft chapters here, through the index page.\n\nChapter five, though, is going to be a bit different than anything I’ve done in my previous books. Instead of having the ship’s artificial intelligence spend an entire chapter simply talking to the reader, we’re going to literally jump into the mind of Jack Marcellus, which will detail certain unrevealed things and lead up to the beginning of NETHERBOUND, at which point the story will continue, mostly uninterrupted from any further gazing into the past.\n\nWay back when I originally started writing this book, the beginning was very, very different. With those ideas from the first incarnation in mind, I’ll be using them to detail in a much shorter fashion the how and why. For months I struggled with wanting to write that particular story, but also wanting to move forward to what I had planned next. Although I have explained my reasons for doing all that I’ve done, this is another reason I decided to start with what I wanted to do next, and gently inject the original story into this new form the story has taken.\n\nBut hey, that’s all for now. I hope you enjoy reading what I’ve got so far for the rough draft, and look forward to what’s to come. The pacing may be a bit slower, but that’s how rollercoasters work, right?\n"

    "content": "TotF: The Shattering\n\n\n\nOn May 24th, 2019, I published a short story named Throne of the Forsaken: The Shattering (available here and here), which detailed a fictional world where the Earth has been heavily impacted by cataclysmic climate change. The situation is so dire that the planet has transformed into what Venus might have been before it was completely uninhabitable. And through the miracle of human engineering, the entire population of Earth seeks to salvage their survival.\n\n\n\nThis was and is meant to set the stage for a larger story and an entire new universe that takes place 20,000 years later on a transformed and healed planet, now called Ellenara.\n\n\n\nLocation names are working titles\n\n\n\nThe idea is that I want to craft my own fantasy type world, except instead of being in a place of an imagined past, it is the future. But, I won't be continuing this world with an immediate 100,000+ word follow-up, and here's why.\n\n\n\nRight now we live in a world where many things demand our attention, and everything is very fast-paced. We all ingest more information than the average person did 60 years ago (just 60 years!) in their entire lifetimes, now, in a single day. Because of this, it seems to me that, as a still somewhat unknown author, a full-blown months, to year long novel project could be a risk, a very large risk.\n\n\n\nIn order to negate such a risk, though, I will instead, first and foremost, be writing at least five more short stories that take place in this new future, within the world of the reshaped Earth. This will involve multiple characters of different races, such as Marked Elves, Smog Knolls, Tempest Halflings, Torn Dwarves and more.\n\n\n\nBut, I will also be writing other short stories that take place in entirely different universes.\n\n\n\nThis multiverse I've got setup is loosely based on another type of shattering that happened at the end of the third book I published (NetherBound), and how a time paradox forever changed the multiverse as we knew it (or didn't know it).\n\n\n\nMore of that may or may not be detailed, but what's coming next from me, at least in the world of fiction will be: 'Throne of the Forsaken: The Witch of the East', and a short story in a completely different universe called, 'Standby, Reallocating' (I'm keeping this one almost entirely a secret).\n\n"

    "content": "Or not, because this definitely is not my last album.\n\n\n\nTerminus cover art, by Ensomber\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, almost immediately after I released ReKall (which is still rising in popularity, especially on Spotify, where I've currently hit over 2000 monthly streams), I hatched an idea for my very next album (and yes, I already have my ideas for the album that comes after this one!)\n\n\n\nFor a seriously, really long time, I've been a huge fan of the Mass Effect series. So much so that I actually wrote about how I feel Mass Effect 2 is a cyberpunk masterpiece, over on Pastel Wasteland. And Terminus, the next Eyeshadow 2600 FM album that releases on October 25th, is a direct result of that.\n\n\n\nAnd I mean direct.\n\n\n\nFrom the opening track, 'Omega', and its follow-up, 'More Human Than Human', to the emotionally charged, 'Her Blue Girlfriend' all the way to the end with 'Subject Zero' and 'From Memories Long Ago'—All subsequently calling back to things many people have probably absolutely forgotten about by now.\n\n\n\nThis album much less follows the direct story-line of Mass Effect, though, but more follows a future memory of things that may or may not have happened. Memories from the mind of a hollow shadow—A construction who once was, and can never be again, the savior of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n\n\nSo far, Terminus has two singles available, along with corresponding remixes, bonus content, and music videos. The first, being 'More Human Than Human', and the second, 'Omega.'\n\n\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the full album is now also available for pre-order, direct from Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nBut before this album releases and I move on to what comes next, we've got one more single headed this way before October. A single featuring synthy vibes, vocals and even a guitar solo?! Yes. Another first for Eyeshadow 2600 FM!\n\n\n\nThat's just it though. The entirety of Terminus has been nothing but nonstop firsts for my music, and new directions I never even thought I'd be able to go, and yet, here we are.\n\n\n\nWelcome, to the end of the beginning.\n\n"

    "content": "A lot of the times, at least when I'm in Sims 4, I have a tendency to start new games over and over again, without any clear goals as to what I want to do. Not even most of the challenges can make it easy for me to finally just stick with something. Part of this is due to the fact that my original game was awesome, but I messed it up with too much modding and game-altering with things like MCCC (a mod I would highly recommend for story progression, and especially this challenge, at least, if you want your offspring to make their own lives without your intervention).\n\n\n\nSo, in the spirit of my original game, and in order to give myself hundreds of hours of game-play, I wrote up a challenge loosely based around the Legacy Challenge, except much, much longer, completely ridiculous, and based on real events that took place in my original game.\n\n\n\nThe challenge itself is much too large to paste into this blog post, so I have it hosted here via my Google Drive where you can read up on how to get started, and what's expected in order to complete it (this challenge will likely take you a minimum of 500 some in-game hours to even come close to finishing).\n\n\n\nBe sure to use the #VampHouseChallenge hashtag on the Sims 4 gallery to download some starting homes, or sims, and save what you make there if you like! I will surely check them out and maybe even introduce new sims into my own game.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest things about this, though, is that it is based on your main founder sims both being vampires, but not before you've had one child to a random sim in the world whom you will later divorce. That's just one of the pieces of drama that you're required to create in order to finish sections of this challenge. Another piece being the death of a sibling during a particular wedding, and a basement dedicated to the murder of random sims, including the Landgraabs.\n\n\n\nAnd this is all before you make it to part two of the challenge, the vampire hunting section.\n\n\n\nTechnically you could play and complete part one and call it a day, but this challenge is, as mentioned earlier, designed to be a long-road sort of game that takes you forever to complete. Without further ado, though, enjoy! (and let me know if you have any issues with this challenge, as I'll be revising and updating as needed)\n\n\n\nYou can reach me either by commenting here, or via Mastodon.\n\n\n\nHere's what you'll find from me in the  #VampHouseChallenge hashtag on the gallery, in order to help get you started (if you like):\n\n\n\nMorgan Karga, the original 'vampire spouse' from the game that inspired this challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonovan Karga, an alternate male variation of Morgan Karga, for those who aren't interested in a female spouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn 1800 simolean starter 'home' for the Bargain Bend lot, with all the essentials to get you going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, an under-20k-starter for your future vampire spouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt that, you now have the tools to get your game underway!\n\n"

    "content": "This is going to make me sound old, and maybe rightfully so. There are good things about the new age, the new landscape in which the way the world works, but there are also a lot of bad things. Bad things, like mass-disinformation in the form of short video content, sludge-video content (multiple videos side-by-side in the same post i.e., Tik Tok), splintered social media that is almost entirely just people lying, or saying fake things they don't actually believe in order to do the numbers (most of the time for no reason other than to feel like a celebrity)...\n\n\n\nAnd then you have post-2020 dating apps. In a world where most everything you see online feels fake and contrived, and every corporation wants your attention in order to get you to buy, buy, buy, while prices rise, rise, rise, you have split-second, window-shopping dating.\n\n\n\nBack in 2010, or, at this point, \"back in the old days,\" you would log onto a website named OKCupid, and you weren't asked to spend fifty six dollars a month to see and/or message people. You simply just made your profile, and then searched for people with similar interests and backgrounds, and then you messaged them and setup dates. That's it. Back in the age of Mafia Wars, The Sims Social, and a baby version of Twitter where engagement farming was nothing more than a twinkle in the eye of an idea of what a hustle bro might be. Back in those days you had honest-to-god normal dating online.\n\n\n\nAnd then that was destroyed. Utterly decimated. An orbital nuke was dropped on that whole-ass thing.\n\n\n\nIf you're someone with social anxiety, and reservations about meeting strangers too quickly (hello, true crime podcasts), you're pretty much dead-in-the-water in the way of dating. Because, let's face it, dating doesn't happen offline anymore. Not intentionally. Meeting people at bars is a great way to meet a drunk, and do things you regret. Meeting people in public places isn't advised, because most of the time, people aren't bumbling around public looking to meet strangers. They're trying to get their shit down, and get home.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, some people meet their significant others in online games, and sometimes even that mass of fakeness that corpo social media seems to be nowadays (Mastodon excluded, I can't get enough of Mastodon). But stories like that are one in a million.\n\n\n\nSo you log onto Tinder, or one of the forty other apps that are pretending to be Tinder. You upload a few photos, write some sort of profile, and start matching. That's the easy part. The next part, is to navigate your social anxiety enough that you can forego the fear of rejection and message someone. But your message better be interesting, and it better be eye-catching, and it better be something original, and it better be funny, and it better be--You see what I'm getting at. It's garbage. And on quiet nights, it all has me wondering, \"Who the fuck asked for this? For real?\"\n\n\n\nWas it silicon valley nerds? Were they upset in 2005 when Facebook started to not be the hot-girl-rating app it was designed to be from the start? Is it corporations trying to turn a profit on your loneliness like some kind of money-sucking, heartless machine? Is it both? I don't know, maybe?\n\n\n\nYou're probably wondering by now, if you've made it this far, if I have an answer to challenge all of this. I don't. I just have an ever-growing singularity in my soul that never stops as technology gets worse, and worse. As \"AI\" threatens to kill jobs, as the climate threatens to melt all of us into puddles, and as Tinder and it's ninety seven wannabes dangle bot-people with blurred photos in front of your face, begging you for eight hundred thousand dollars a month in order to unlock them.\n\n\n\nWelcome to hell.\n\n"

    "content": "We've all been there. You're trying to figure out what direction to take next in your book, or what stroke to make next on the canvas, and undecided, you put it down for four months. It happens. Whaddya gonna do about it?\n\n\n\nI would certainly hope that those feelings of being creatively blank, or blocked, wouldn't lead you down the path of using an algorithm to generate something for you. Especially if you plan on selling it, and especially if you plan to call it something you made on your own.\n\n\n\nBut that's what's been going on lately. Unscrupulous tech-dudes developed a piece of software that scrounges up whatever it can find on the internet--other people's art and writing--and shoves it into its learning model, without consent. Because how are you going to get engagement and make a billion dollars if you have to ask people for permission to use their work? Oh, woe, the thought of not stealing and learning how to do something on your own. What plebeian would even dare suggest such a thing?\n\n\n\nSarcasm aside, this is a fad that is absolutely sweeping the mainstream. Why? Because, unfortunately, a lot, and I mean a lot of people do not think about what they consume. They just consume. And that is the over-arching problem here, alongside the obviously mega-brainiacs who decided that plagiarism was cool. I see it all of the time. Someone doesn't want to use a screenshot from their favorite show or anime as an avatar on social media. Nor do they want to use their own face, so what do they opt for? Oh, oh we're going to use the theft and plagiarism monolith to make you something passable as a photo, but just barely.\n\n\n\nTo me, most AI generated photos look like a greasy nightmare scene, even when it tries to make things look normal. You put a photo of something that's supposed to be human in front of me, generated by an AI, and I will know immediately that it's fabricated nonsense scraped from other people's photos (again! without consent!).\n\n\n\nIt is, without skipping a beat, every single time, always subtly horrifying. Something that will cause you to recoil, and in some cases, you may not even know why, at least not immediately.\n\n\n\nBut I'm not writing this to endlessly critique the extreme lack of talent that AI prompting zeros do. I'm writing this, because if we want the act of expressing human emotion through genuine means to persevere into the future, and I'm not talking 2077, I'm talking 10 years from now, we have to take a zero tolerance stance with this stuff. Think about how you treat nazis on social media. No tolerance. Fuck 'em. They're gone. Think about how you treat trolls. Get outta here, bruh.\n\n\n\nOkay, now apply that to people who are generating the epitome of fear through photos that look like they were ripped out of the back rooms, and let's start keeping them out of our spaces. Let's start banning them. Let's start silencing them, and removing every ounce of voice they might seek to have. Stamp them out until they have nowhere to turn, until they are themselves convinced that ripping people off is not something that constitutes artificial intelligence, and is just, plain and simple, disgusting, deplorable, and lacking in morals, and basic consideration for your fellow man.\n\n\n\nStart giving a shit.\n\n"

    "url": "/second life/2024/01/21/the-story-behind-revosa.html",
    "content": "One day back in late 2014, I had just lost my job. There is a whole entire story behind this with years worth of history connected to it, but for now, and today, this story is about the store I started and still run in Second Life.\n\n\n\nBut, I lost my job, and prospects of finding a replacement were grim. On top of that, I needed a break. It's unfortunate that said break resulted in me developing a nasty fear of people, and severe anxiety problems (things I've since worked almost all the way through). Nowhere to turn, I was browsing Youtube looking for ways to make money. I had already been active in Second Life since 2012. It was a place I rented a small home from Linden Labs, and hung out with offline friends in virtual apartments watching Spongebob, or hanging out at a local furry club. Times were different for me back then.\n\n\n\nI stumbled upon a Youtube video of a woman who had a small family at home, and like me, she'd lost her job. I think she said, in her instance, she had been laid off. With some tenacity, she managed to turn it around by learning how to use Blender, and by applying those skills in Second Life in order to build herself a virtual shoe store. This, as far as I could tell from things detailed in the video, brought her the good fortune of being able to pay her bills and continue like nothing happend. Looking back about 10 years, you could say I was convinced.\n\n\n\nThen I saw another video about a couple who'd seemingly up and completely quit their jobs just to be realtors of land in Second Life. I think the story for them is, they eventually made so much money, they stopped doing that as well, and bought a restaurant. And, perusing Second Life myself, there were and still are very many stores that give the impression that they're making some actual cash.\n\n\n\nAnd that settled it. I needed to start making things in Second Life, and by doing so, I would replace my income, and I would work for myself.\n\n\n\nIf only it were that easy.\n\n\n\nBut I didn't launch [REVOSA] right off the bat. I had a friend in Second Life that I hung out with daily, and after a break-up, she became someone I spent all of my virtual time with. Through her, I learned a lot of different techniques in using Blender, and how it could be used to make legitimately anything you can imagine. We built up a joint store of sorts together, and we listed products we'd both made, side-by-side. This was in the early days when I still trusted people. When I felt like, at the very least, people close to me could be trusted.\n\n\n\nNaivity always gets the best of you.\n\n\n\nLuckxe and I had a bit of an online, virtual relationship, you could call it. But it was one that was fleeting, as it usually is in a pretend world where you have access to anyone and everyone on a whim, and people's desires change like I change my socks. One day her and I had a \"thing,\" the next she was with a guy who was very passionate about cars.\n\n\n\nAnd then that was that. But it wasn't just the relationship that went, it was also everything her and I made together. Those things, shaped by both of our hands, all became her's, and her's alone. About 3 or 4 months of working together, gone, and me, back at square one.\n\n\n\nThis was a problem, as I was definitely not content to give up replacing my income just because I made a bad decision.\n\n\n\nSo I made the only decision one should make, and that decision was to go into business for myself, by myself, and never, ever invite anyone to partner up again.\n\n\n\n[REVOSA] started, literally, in a garage I put up on a small parcel, making paint jobs for people who raced cars, and then, eventually, avatar accessories, system clothing, knick knacks and odd jobs. Eventually, the store grew, and continued to grow. It moved from parcel to parcel, sim to sim, until 2023 when I decided to rent an entire sim, just for myself, and my store. And it stands there today.\n\n\n\nDid it ever replace my income? No. No, it just about pays for a couple of World of Warcraft subscriptions per month, and nothing else. A lot of people do say that a store in Second Life needs to be in operation for at least a decade or so before it really gains permanent traction, and I have seen quite a rise in sales in the past 6 months. But as I am working offline in a regular job, the answer I was looking for was never found in these virtual spaces.\n\n\n\nBut I do still operate [REVOSA], and I do still have that idea in my head: Maybe Second Life will find a way to give me the job I always wanted. A creative thing I could do, for myself, by myself, for just enough money to live on. Whether that ever actually happens is a mystery left for the future, and it is of course not my only creative endeavor, thankfully. It is, though, nice to dream.\n\n\n\nThat's where [REVOSA] came from, and that's why it still stands in 2024.\n\n"

Today I'm writing to make available some information about what's going on at Neo Machina, my future-city sim within the virtual world.\n\n\n\nFor a full year, Neo Machina mostly only had on-sim rentals, including a few shop spaces, and apartments.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Neo Machina was upgraded to a full region with capacity for 110 total users, and 30,000 land impact. With that, I've begun the expansion of the city to the (near) full expanse of the sim.\n\n\n\nI've also placed down more spaces for on-sim rentals including apartments, homes, and shops, and it doesn't stop there!\n\n\n\nAs of right now, there are two parceled skyboxes for rent, which you can buy, and control with full parcel rights. \n\n\n\nThe first rental is over at Synchro, a 1792 square meter parcel at 2000 meters in the air, coming in at 820 land impact for 852 linden per week.\n\n\n\nThe second rental is over at Cosmina, a 1024 square meter parcel also at 2000 meters in the air, coming in at 468 land impact for 482 linden per week.\n\n\n\nBoth of these parcels can be \"purchased\" as part of your land ownership, and used as you please (with the exception to some simple rules to follow that you'll find in an informational box at the parcel itself). Both of these parcels are a great deal in comparison to what's normally on offer around Second Life.\n\n\n\nFor example, normally, when you rent a 1024 sq. parcel anywhere else in Second Life, your land impact will vary from 200-300. But with Neo Machina, you get a bonus of over 150 land impact! Dang choom, that's pretty sweet, right?\n\n\n\nAnyway, use the above links to drop by in-world and give them a look-see for yourself.\n\n\n\nRenters should stay within the land area and elevation provided, any breakage of rules can result in revocation of said parcels, and without a refund.\n\n\n\nThank you for your interest!\n\n"

    "content": "If you could permanently ban a word from general usage, which one would it be? Why?\n\n\n\nI’ve been spending parts of my day reading other people’s thoughts on this topic. A lot seem to say or have the same train of thought, “I wouldn’t ban words, I believe in freedom of speech!” And I think this is one of those instances where I would almost tend to agree, but why?\n\n\n\nObviously, nobody wants to deal with hate. It’s the year 2024 now, and people hauling out pea-brained ideas of their fellow people intended to harm, ridicule, and marginalize is something that needed to be a thing of the past twenty years ago. Not even so much as a “can’t we all just get along” sort of deal but just kind of a line of thinking where I’m personally at, “Jesus Christ, let people exist and keep your nasty thoughts to yourself.”\n\n\n\nWould banning words make it easier for everyone to exist in peace? \n\n\n\nNo, no it wouldn’t. If you ban the word “fart,” people are still going to squeeze out putrid gas from betwixt their butt cheeks. Just like if we ban slurs and words that are otherwise hateful, the hate-mongers around us will just find another way to be hate-mongers. If we ban the word “Nazi,” Nazis will just find something else to call themselves.\n\n\n\nThat’s the thing about language, it’s endless. Some words are unpleasant, and I know this especially from experience. Such as completely at random having a dude come at me from my driver side door calling me slurs for reasons I still don’t fully understand.\n\n\n\nSome people are bad. That’s how it is.\n\n\n\nIf we ever arrive at a point where banning words comes up, as a society, we should first take a look at reforming and rehabilitating the people around us who live and breathe hatred. Deconstruct institutions that preach inferiority and the othering of our neighbors.\n\n\n\nDo that, and banning words won’t matter.\n\n"

It started with writing HTML for band fan pages on Geocities, and then that evolved into writing a book. Then that became teaching myself Blender, and then came learning FL Studio.\n\n\n\nAll of this built up into this one, mega-project, where I've become this jack-of-all-trades: Managing a store in Second Life (where I make the assets myself and then sell them to users of the virtual world), writing multiple books (with a few self published under my belt), working on my next album (out of 21 so far), and running my own Mastodon instance with a side blog on a Wordpress installation via Debian Linux.\n\n\n\nI call all of this a mega-project, or, one big project, because really, it has become this life-long thing where I'm building projects I enjoy, and working on building a community around those things, or of just like-minded people, all in an attempt to obtain what everyone really wants--Total independence from the regular, normal, day-to-day grind. And it is the most ambitious thing I've ever done, because doing all of these things takes a lot of energy. It takes a lot of drive to never, ever give up. Even if that community isn't really building itself on its own. Even if you're not reaching billions of Spotify streams, or one hundred thousand books sold.\n\n\n\nIt's a labor of love, a labor of passion, a labor that never dies.\n\n\n\nAfter, now, numerous decades of just constantly building and creating, I can't say I'd trade it for anything. I can't ever see myself going to work in a regular job, coming home, and then sleeping, and never making anything ever again. To me, that'd be the real soul killer. And, in a way, maybe that isn't so ambitious, but it is the project.\n\n"

    "content": "If you're a user of Windows, and have been for a large portion of your life, you're probably astounded that, via Windows 11, Microsoft is both trying to mimic Apple, and embedding information theft directly into your desktop. What do I mean? I mean, Apple does Apple better than Microsoft, and the inaccurately named \"AI\" that every billion dollar company is jumping on, is now also a part of your Windows desktop.\n\n\n\nI don't know what kind of information it's collecting, I don't know if it even is, but a corporation being a corporation, you can bet it's likely. Stealing your information to sell to advertisers, and training LLMs so that it can better replace you, and possibly your job.\n\n\n\nAutomattic, the owners of Tumblr and Wordpress.com (not to be confused with the open source self-hosted Wordpress), have also not only bought into AI, but are openly planning to sell your information to Midjourney (Midjourney is a very openly anti-consent theft machine for generating images). There is, of course, little concrete detail about this thus far, but I'm not taking any chances.\n\n\n\nBack to the Windows problem, though, I'm also not taking any chances with what Microsoft will or won't do with their \"AI.\"\n\n\n\nAnd thus, I have moved to Debian 12.\n\n\n\nDebian is one of many Linux distros, and one of my favorites (I'm also a frequent MacOS user, but that's beside the point). It's very much an in-between for experienced users, and beginners. But the best part about it? It's helmed by a non-profit, and there ain't any AI in it.\n\n\n\nAs time marches forward, I fully believe every corporation, or corporate owned entity, from Sheetz to Bluesky, will have some sort of AI implementation in order to make bank off of what you type, what you post, and what you create. Which means, the era of open source has truly begun.\n\n\n\nIf you're looking to get away from thieving corpos and their slightly advanced chatbots, here is a list of things you can use and know you aren't, or at least have a very less likely chance of being, run dry by a scraper.\n\n\n\n\nMastodon - An open source social media project with a few forks wherein you can choose a server, sign up, and start posting just like you're on Twitter. Or, better yet, spin up a VPS and host your own copy! ... and then start posting like you're on Twitter.\n\n\n\nDebian - An open source Linux distro that I favor greatly. Debian 12 only requires a bootable, and you're done. I highly recommend reading up on basic Linux usage if you're considering this.\n\n\n\nPeertube - A Youtube alternative that doesn't have any ads, no algorithm, and isn't hanging up a \"Don't be evil\" sign, just to take it down like some kind of cartoon villain. Peertube is connected to the same network that Mastodon runs on (ActivityPub), as are the next two networks in this list.\n\n\n\nLemmy - A Reddit alternative run on AP that connects many servers together with more topics and communities than you can throw a penny at. Not run by an idiot CEO who thinks he's Elon Musk Jr.\n\n\n\nPixelfed - An Instagram alternative that's much like the Insta-of-old. Join up, post your photos, call it day.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are alternatives for every single beast you've known for the past decade, or the past two decades (or three). Of course, Tik Tok is excluded, but it's far too late for TT to be anything other than a disinformation rage-machine, and an alternative would only be ... well, it'd probably suck.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to your information, and your identity, and your work, you should take these things seriously. You should protect what's yours, especially in a world where corporations are more and more siding with the idea that you do not own anything.\n\n\n\nI originally wanted to write this just to talk about how great the switch to Debian 12 was, from a Windows 11 install, but my thoughts have a way of trailing off into philosophy zone.\n\n\n\nSo ...\n\n\n\nTake back what's yours, take back the internet, take back your data, and rest easy.\n\n"

Absolutely not. The universe exists in total chaos and we, the human species, exist entirely by biological accident. \n\n\n\nBut then again, maybe that’s incorrect?\n\n\n\nThere are already theories about potential for a multiverse to be a thing that really exists. An infinite number of universes like our own, existing side-by-side in a dimension of space that we cannot see or experience as beings who live solely on a three dimensional plane.\n\n\n\nIf it’s true that there are an infinite number of each and every one of us, then time itself is something that must already be laid out in front of us, and also behind us. And I do believe that this also has something to do with relativity, or not. I’m not sure, I just know a lot about black holes and what happens to time and space beyond one of those horizons.\n\n\n\nSo, is Neo’s fate much like our own? Predetermined, doomed to happen again and again, even with slight variance in the way these things happen?\n\n\n\nWho knows, maybe?\n\n\n\nWe’ll probably never know for sure.

    "content": "In my last post, I suggested you, the reader, abandon Windows, jump ship, get out while you still can, and dive directly into Debian. What I didn't talk about, was how to create a bootable flash drive so that you can install it! This is, of course, sparsely detailed on the Debian Wiki itself, and maybe across many different websites.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore often than not, I find when I'm looking for instructions on how to do things in or with Debian, or Linux in-general, people don't give all the details. Or the details are mixed up, or for really old versions (this is common not only across the installation of Debian and other distros, but in using basic, or even advanced terminal commands to do with installing software).\n\n\n\nSo, in order to get started, and say goodbye to that pesky Windows installation, grab your flash drive by the butt, and slap that motherfreaker into your USB3 slot.\n\n\n\nNext, download the .iso you want from the official website. I highly suggest grabbing the 64-bit net installation! It makes things a bit faster (if you're really itching to get going). You can, of course, choose other isos if you're more familiar with what you want, and what you're doing. But for now, we're just going to use this one.\n\n\n\nNext, head over here and grab Rufus, the software you'll be using to create a drive that boots. This is by far the easiest way to do it, and it is the officially suggested way on the Debian wiki.\n\n\n\nNow, the software may or may not be self-explanatory. The reason I say \"may or may not\" is because many people interpret things differently, and you could be one of those people ending up on Google searching, \"How do I make a bootable drive with Rufus?\"\n\n\n\nOnce you've got it downloaded, open it up! Under the \"Device\" section, choose your flash drive. Next, via the \"Boot Selection\" section, choose the iso you downloaded a second ago. Important: Do not physically store the iso on the flash drive, and then try to create a bootable installation from that iso while it's on the drive (it won't work).\n\n\n\nThat's it! You don't really need to touch anything else, because it'll already know what you're doing. Slap that \"Start\" button in the face with your fingers.\n\n\n\nOnce complete, exit the program.\n\n\n\nNow we're going to force Windows 11 to boot from your flash drive. This can be sort of tricky, because Mikeysoft doesn't want you to delete Wamdows.\n\n\n\nTo start, press the Windows key, plus the I key (that's the i, not that L), and then enter the \"settings\" menu. Next, head into System, and then Recovery. Under the \"Advanced Startup\" section, click \"Restart now.\"\n\n\n\nOnce the PC restarts, you'll be expected to choose an option. The option you'll want is ... to boot from a USB device!\n\n\nAdded section for those on recent Dell laptops.\n\nI'm quickly going to interject this post I wrote earlier in 2024, and provide a little bit of an update, for those who have newer, or at least recent Dell laptops. In some installations, even after selecting the USB drive that you'd like to boot from (i.e., the Debian one in this tutorial), Dell's SupportAssist may interject, and take over, effectively overriding your Debian flash drive. In order to disable this, you'll want to navigate into the bios itself and scroll to the bottom of the boot section where it asks you what priority you want the SupportAssist program to take when it \"detects\" that Windows is failing to boot. Set that freaker to zero. Now ... you're good to go.\n\nOnce you've saved your new bios configuration, and exited back to the boot screen, your flash drive should simply take over, and boot right to the Debian setup screen. If it doesn't, for whatever reason, go back into Windows, and retrace your steps to the \"Recovery\" and \"Advanced Startup\" settings, and repeat what you did before.\n\n\nAt this point, you'll begin the Debian install. I would choose the graphical option, because that's what I chose, and it worked fine. Going through the installation, it's going to ask you a lot of basic questions in regard to what you want. If you're feeling unsure, I went with the Gnome desktop environment and skipped the others (there'll be a list of them).\n\n\n\nOnce you make it through the download process, you'll be prompted to disconnect your USB drive and restart.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you've made it.\n\n\n\nTo get you started with your fresh and clean install of Debian, watch this video for some absolutely essential things you should do right from the get-go. Trust me on this one, choomba. \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to this guy, his content is a life-saver.\n\n"

    "content": "How often do you say “no” to things that would interfere with your goals?\n\n\n\nThis is kind of an ambiguous question, at least for me, because I have a lot of goals. But by and large, most of my goals have to do with either learning new things, doing creative work in my free time, and advancing at work.\n\n\n\nIn the past four years I’ve always said “No” to things that got in the way of my … work goals. I’ve achieved a lot in that respect, and it’s definitely something to feel proud about.\n\n\n\nThe sad part is, I’ve always viewed my day job as a buffer in between what I actually want to do. I want to be one of those online creators, and for a while I was, and I was gaining steam. But life got in the way along with a myriad of other things.\n\n\n\nIt isn’t that I feel like I’m getting too old for it, because, for all intents and purposes, age doesn’t stop anyone from making a job out of creating online and turning that into a career.\n\n\n\nWhat’s stopping me, is that I always say “No” to the things that might drive me closer to this particular goal. I say it because I’m tired, because I’m too exhausted, because I want to game, or spend my time outside of work relaxing and hanging out in Second Life. And it’s because of that, that I have a book I haven’t written for in months, a Second Life store I haven’t made anything for in an even longer period of time, a music career that hasn’t seen movement since I released an album months ago, and a “YouTuber” idea I have that I haven’t even remotely started yet. \n\n\n\nMaybe this prompt was good, because I needed a reminder as to what my actual goal is. The real question is, can I stop saying “No?” I used to do what I wanted to do with my creative work whether I was tired or not, but over time that feeling of fatigue has only increased, and I worry it’s made me complacent in a state of non-movement.\n\n\n\nThat’s the real issue: Complacency. \n\n"

    "content": "What’s something most people don’t understand?\n\n\n\nThis is an interesting prompt, because there is no way in the world I could possibly know what the average consensus of people usually don't understand. I could say, \"Most people don't understand that the genre of Cyberpunk is a warning, not an aspiration.\" But, is that true? Is that really something most people don't understand?\n\n\n\nWho knows? I'm just making an assumption there, aren't I?\n\n\n\nI feel as though it's more accurate to say that most people don't understand quantum physics and string theory. Which, for all intents and purposes, is probably true. Because most people probably also don't really understand Einstein's Theory of Relativity. And I can't truthfully say that I fully understand it, either.\n\n\n\nI know that black holes exist. I know that when moving through space, time itself experiences dilation, and gravity affects that dilation. You can see fictional examples of this in movies like Interstellar, where it's (maybe) accurately depicted that being in proximity to a black hole vastly dilates time for those on Earth, in contrast to the crew who have left.\n\n\n\nBut do I understand why that's happening? Do most people?\n\n\n\nI mean, not really?\n\n\n\nYou could very well tell me that what most people understand or experience as the concept of \"ghosts\" is really just an effect of gravitational lensing in relation to the multiverse theory, and we're just seeing a thin window, or crack in the fabric of space and time, into some other person's reality. And it would sound just as wild as the concept of black holes, relativity, and time dilation.\n\n\n\nAnd, I might take the risk of the hazard of a guess, that most people, or, the average person who may read that previous paragraph, might look at it and go, \"What in the hell are you even saying?\"\n\n\n\nBut, I am, again, just making another assumption.\n\n\n\nI think we all make a lot of assumptions about each other. It makes dealing with the onslaught of information a bit easier. To make assumptions, to superficially assume to understand something that took a literal genius years to comprehend.\n\n\n\nI know why space bends time, but I don't understand it, and I don't think anyone else does either. Just like I don't think people understand each other, not really, not until they take the time to really speak to them, and let them speak for themselves.\n\n"

Needless to say, I checked updates and versions of XZ on both my Pop!_OS system and my Debian 12 laptop faster than you can say, \"Oh farts, I've lost my juice!\"\n\n\n\nBut, you actually don't really need to worry all that much, unless you're running pre-release versions of most distributions, as detailed here via openwall.com.\n\n\n\nThat doesn't mean it's not something you should worry about, if you're outside of that scope of instances. In fact, if I were you, I'd open a terminal and check your XZ version, just to be sure.\n\n\n\nThe versions you DON'T want, are versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1, and you can check this by running xz --version in the terminal.

Its idling sounds like the low hum of an aircraft taking off, and the hard drive clicks like a woodpecker having a seizure. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's late November 1995, and you've just installed the new Windows ... 95. This was a process that took many hours, as you had to reformat your hard drive, and that is not a simple, or even quick task. There were, of course, some hardware errors, because you didn't configure an IRQ correctly, and your drive letters were messed up.\n\n\n\nBut all of that is over now, and you're sitting on your pristine, clean new desktop. Time to boot up Netscape Navigator and surf the web! You're one of the cool dudes now.\n\n\n\nThe modem comes to life and dials into your ISP, which sounds like a Borg assimilating your computer, screeching with pings that rubber band back and forth through your PC's speakers. After it finishes, all noise ceases, and you are now connected. Sweat drips from your forehead, and you pray that nobody picks up the phone that hangs from the wall in the kitchen. You need those cheat codes, and you forgot to bookmark the webpage, so it's going to take you a while to find it again.\n\n\n\nThat's okay, though, you're sure you can remember the videogames chatroom you found on a random Geocities webpage through your webring.\n\n\n\nAfter about an hour, you've found them! Now you can finally beat Command & Conquer, and be better prepared for the one-on-one your friend at school has been planning to have against you.\n\n\n\nRecollections of the past aside, the internet was vastly different in the nineties. Especially different, as Windows 95 came out, mostly rendering the need to use DOS for everything null and void. The era of demo CDs, and megabytes of ram. Doom, and its lesser spoken about sister, Quake. Terminal Velocity, Tomb Raider, America Online, e ... e-mail!\n\n\n\nA lot of people, including myself, look back upon this era with heavy nostalgia. Some of it may be rose-tinted glasses, but I really do think some of that, \"It was better back then,\" philosophical waxing is true. Thirty years ago, corporations had much less control over the internet. It wasn't really a thing billion-dollar companies saw as the place to be, like they do now. It was a disjointed mess of personal websites, businesses, chatrooms, and p ... not safe for work material.\n\n\n\nGoing online was like an adventure. Discovering things felt exhilarating. Even just connecting to another person in Quake and playing against them in a deathmatch felt ... it felt like the future.\n\n\n\nAnd it was.\n\n\n\nBut the future came, and then it passed us by. And now we're dealing with the enshitifcation of everything we once knew. And some of you never had the chance to know the internet the way it was before it became a money-grubbing, subscription begging, click-bating, engagement farming, ad-infested hellhole.\n\n\n\nMaybe this is a bit of doomsaying, maybe I just miss the way things were when I was a child. Simple. Not terrifying.\n\n\n\nI mean, I guess it did kind of suck to wait four hours to download a single episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion.\n\n\n\nWhat's the point of this post? I think we can double-back. I think the internet can become fun again. And I think the only way to do it is to learn. Go open source. Delve into Mastodon. Rid yourself of as much corporate software as you can. Even if you love your iPhone, you can still use Linux. You can find a free and open alternative to every single thing you use on a daily basis, and if enough people do this... well, there's only so much money the corporations can suck out of the masses until they just stop giving them money. Until there's no reason to keep shoving \"AI\" into every orifice offered up by the bastardized internet. Until they've decided, \"You know what? Maybe we should go back to printing ads in magazines or something, I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nBesides, what's better than free?\n\n"

Scraping content from creative people, from writers, from artists, from those who make the world a more vibrant place, in order to replace those people. Replace them with zero effort, hallucination-esque, garbage. \n\n\n\nAnd, just like with the NFT grift, there are people who have and do die hard for automated content theft.\n\n\n\nFlash back to my instance, I have strict rules against the usage and posting of any and all ai-generated content on my instance, and those I federate with. In that, no questions asked, if you post that sort of thing, you become invisible to my instance. Which, not many people should have an issue with? It's my instance! It affects almost no one but me if I decide I don't want to see creatively bankrupt digital vomit.\n\n\n\nBut I do speak out about this at times, on regular intervals.

    "content": "If you've been on the internet for the past five years, or even the past ten years, you might remember that moment on Twitter where someone noted that the people at Google's headquarters in California took down their \"Don't be evil\" sign and/or removed it from their CoC, as if they were cartoon villains getting ready to do something nefarious. And nefarious things they did do, and are preparing to do more of.\n\n\n\nIf you've been paying attention as of late, Google is preparing to force ads through your adblocker via Youtube, and they are also, of course, yet another tech giant incorporating AI into every service you access (even if you have no qualms with the no-consent ethos of these AI image scrapers, you have to care about your privacy, just a little bit).\n\n\n\nNearly a decade ago, I didn't really care much about my own privacy, or how ads were shown to me. I just used the internet, watched the ads, viewed the products, and went about my day as if it wasn't a big deal. But that was also back in the day of Mafia Wars, and doing my daily clicks on Facebook. There were a lot of things I didn't really think about all that much.\n\n\n\nBut I'm older now, and more conscious of the ways my data is being used by billion-dollar corporations as they prepare to do even further damage to our climate, our mental health, and our privacy, with extremely aggressive advertising, and scraping, to boot (see this video on Roku, and how they plan to push ads through your HDMI inputs via a new patent they've filed). All in the name of adding zeros to the already planet-sized amount of money they have and absolutely do not deserve to hoard. To hoard, and gain, in the false idea of infinitely expanding profit. An idea that will surely destroy our entire species.\n\n\n\nTo the point of this post, though, and yes, I know the above linked video goes straight to Youtube, which is owned by Google. And that's why we're here. We're here because I don't think enough people understand or know what Peertube is.\n\n\n\nWe already know about Mastodon, the non-corporate replacement for the engagement and AI-hell that centralized social media is. It's easy enough to escape the coming ad-pocalypse via written communities, but what about the visual?\n\n\n\nAs you may know, Mastodon is connected via the ActivityPub protocol, so all servers can see and interact with each other, along with their users. Well, Peertube is exactly the same. PT is a Youtube clone, that acts as a peer-to-peer video and streaming service. All instances are connected, and not only can you view videos across a network of connected Peertube instances, but they even show up as normal posts that you can see via a Mastodon instance.\n\n\n\nPretty genius, right?\n\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\nThe reason, the real reason I'm writing this, is because I want MORE content to watch on Peertube. Sure, there's a lot of good stuff on there, but I want my true crime, I want my space documentaries, and I want my random gaming vids.\n\n\n\nJoin a Peertube instance, and tell Google to shove Youtube and their profit motives directly up their noses.\n\n\n\nThis has been a public service announcement.\n\n"

    "content": "So this has been a thing since the beginning of the year. I had planned to bring it down, but couldn't really stomach it and decided not to. But another month or so of the server bills came in, and it's got me feeling very tight on cash. Especially with having switched job locations and needing to put gas in my tank a bit more often.\n\n\n\nFor those who don't know, Neo Machina was a sim back in the earlier days of Second Life, that was seemingly shutdown, never to return. I brought it back in my own vision at the start of 2023, and then inflation started eating my wallet about halfway through that year.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to now--high prices, large bills, and my pet project, Neo Machina in Second Life. It's been the only place I care to be, and despite my difficulties in building a community, I have plans to make it bigger.\n\n\n\nBut!\n\n\n\nI am feeling the money pains. So, for now, the sim (server) is offline. To be forthright, it costs about 250 USD or so to keep online via Linden Labs. That's a lot of money. Money I was happily paying.\n\n\n\nNow, though, I need to find a way to supplement my income so that it can come back and be more permanent. Unless, by some miracle, prices in the real world just drop back to the way they were in 2022.\n\n\n\nThere is one thing, though, that potential sim-goers could do, if they should choose, and if they want the place to keep going. This is an option, and not a requirement. I have a Patreon where I post random work I do in creative stuff every so often. It's been pretty quiet the past couple months due to my position switch at work (I make music, I write books, and make things in Second Life for my store).\n\n\n\nThere was a time my Patreon was bringing in well over 100 USD a month. I feel like if I can get it back to that range, then Neo Machina can come back online (of course, sparing real world prices don't drop, or I never get another raise/promotion at work). Again, I won't say anyone has to do this. I have a job, I'm working on a career and figuring out what I want to do. My interests outside of work sometimes make me money, and it would be a miracle if it made me more money than my job! But, I'm just being realistic about my expectations and the things I do.\n\n\n\nNeo Machina will always be special to me, even if for some reason I'm never able to bring it back online.\n\n\n\nEither way, this is my Patreon, and if you're subscribing to see Neo Machina back online, and we reach that point, I'll waive rental fees from you.\n\n"

    "content": "Before I switched positions and location at my offline job, I was pretty heavily into writing this book. I'm not sure why I've been on a cooling-off period for a couple of months in regard to writing it, but that's how it's been my whole life. Took me three years to finish the full manuscript of my first book, and looking back at it ten years later after publishing, I don't even really feel like I would have published it now, had it taken me this long to finish (my tastes and ideas have radically changed since then).\n\n\n\nBut I have, and had, a rough idea for a massive space-horror. A story of loneliness, and isolation. The death of the universe, an outcome of human technological advancement in the face of profit-driven, no-safety-checks expansion. Think of the guy who took a mini-sub into the ocean while ignoring safety standards (safety is for losers, not billionaires). A mission that killed four people and left the whole world watching when the craft virtually disappeared into the dark of the waters.\n\n\n\nThe rich among us absolutely would push technology to the point of total universe destruction, if it meant a few extra bucks in the here and now.\n\n\n\nAnd so I wrote, and tacked away at my keyboard.\n\n\n\nThen, sometime in the midst of writing barely even the fourth chapter, \"AI\" started to gain a lot of traction. Maybe this is why I haven't written much. Basically, anything you write on most popular websites, or publish, or post, whether it be the written word, or a piece of your own art--it is likely being scraped by groups of untalented tech-hacks who want to use what you do, with your spare time, with your blood, sweat, and tears, without consent, for free, and for profit. For profit, in their generative, hallucination-making garbage.\n\n\n\nMaybe that's why I haven't written anything in a while.\n\n\n\nIt's not that I post all of what I've been writing for Dissolution Protocol online, either. Hell, barely anyone has even seen pieces of the rough draft ... because, if I post one snippet, one synopsis, you can bet it's going to end up in some greasy chatbot for the lazy to use in the training of the AI server farms. Only to end up recombobulated into some soulless ham fisted spam-novel, via Amazon.\n\n\n\nSo let's say I finish Dissolution Protocol, and I will, eventually, but let's just pretend we're there. Then what? I self-publish it through means I've been using for two decades, and it ends up alongside auto-generated trash, also self-published, indistinguishable to the average person?\n\n\n\nThings are grim.\n\n\n\nSelf-publishing is taking another hit, this time at the hands of creatively-dead losers, rather than just uppity big-six authors.\n\n\n\nWhat's the answer? What's the solution? Am I to finish the manuscript, and wait five years as it sifts through the hands of agents and publishers and maybe doesn't end up going anywhere? Or do I self-publish, like I always have, and pray that five people find it amidst no-effort junk that exists only to make a dollar?\n\n\n\nWho the hell knows. But, welcome to the future, I guess?\n\n"

But this one is interesting, because you could answer this a few different ways.\n\n\n\nI could say, I learned in high school that I only learn by doing. I can't sit in front of a teacher and a book and learn anything. I just don't parse things in that way. It was so bad that, my math teacher in high school noticed that I was falling behind in advanced algebra, and instead of helping me, and figuring out how best to catch me up with everyone else ... she placed me in a remedial math class to learn how to balance a checkbook.\n\n\n\nBut, as someone who elected to go to vocational school, I was originally going for computer science. And I got one full year of Visual Basic, before I had to switch to a completely different school district ... wherein that same class was filled up, and I wasn't able to join. So, I was made to enter into business technology. You know, learning Microsoft Excel. I kind of blame the aforementioned math teacher, and the class I wanted to be in, being full, as to why I'm not working in a tech field, a field I should absolutely be in by now.\n\n\n\nBeing hard-headed, and dead-set on things I want to do, regardless of whether those opportunities were offered to me, I spent most of my time in BTA teaching myself how to write HTML. The teacher would ask for an example of a Microsoft Access database, and in order to get back to what I was teaching myself, I would print out the example database from the back of the book, and hand it in. And he'd be none-the-wiser. Literally.\n\n\n\nMr. Manning, if you're reading this today, I'm not sorry. I didn't want to be in your class, and you didn't teach anyone a damn thing. I wanted to be in computer science, I wanted to be a sysadmin, and that's not where I'm at right now, and I blame the school, and the school district for not working with me enough to help me be where I needed and wanted to be, for my future.\n\n\n\nI guess you could say, what I learned in high school, is how to do things for myself, for my own future, because nobody else is going to help you get there, but you. And I'm still working on getting there. I don't give up, not on anything.\n\n"

A concept that was a sensation on Tumblr years, and years ago. And then it became something bigger, burst straight from the chest of 4chan.\n\n\n\nThe Backrooms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, the phrase \"noclip\" is kind of juvenile in the way it explains things. Like a videogame, because we definitely can't differentiate reality from a game world. Phasing in and out of reality, that sounds more like a believable piece of science, even if fiction.\n\n\n\nBut I think it goes deeper than that.\n\n\n\nThe Backrooms, The Complex, whatever you call it, it's all based on this idea, and this feeling of liminality. Is it a human feeling? Is it something that exists on a higher dimension that we're unable to decipher with the senses we're given?\n\n\n\nI remember waking up from a nap one day, maybe six years ago at this point, after having dreamt of a person consoling me, for reasons unknown. And when I opened my eyes that same person was standing over me, except darker, shrouded in some kind of malice I couldn't really grasp at the time. Staring down at me. She wasn't any person who existed on this plane, and she vanished seconds after I flipped on the light. And it makes me think, was I there, was I temporarily trapped in some other universe, phasing in and out of what we know to be real?\n\n\n\nOr, was I just exhausted and seeing weird things as a result of sleep deprivation and stress?\n\n\n\nA lot of people look at you like you're off the deep-end if you start talking about ghosts, or other realities, or universes. Some of these things are backed by theoretical science. That a universe, or another reality, could exist on the edges of the dimensions that we can perceive as human beings. But, to the average person, I'm sure that also sounds completely ridiculous.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us back to this creepypasta, Backrooms fiction.\n\n\n\nWhat if you really could slip into some other dimension? What if you couldn't come back? What if every single experience that people around the world describe as ghosts, or supernatural, is just ... some version of another reality, phasing into our own?\n\n\n\nWhat if there are ... other \"rooms\" we can't see? What if your totally regular, meandering life, could suddenly be uprooted and interrupted at the flick of a switch? \n\n\n\nWhat if that's already happened to millions of missing people?\n\n"

    "content": "I wanted to write a story here, in as much a condensed manner as I can, about things I've grappled with, and had going on years ago, and am dealing with the fallout from, even today. But it's complicated, it's messy, it's not fun or happy; it's not a road I've gone down in a cohesive way in a single blog post.\n\n\n\nBack in 2012 I began a transition in the form of taking female hormones, and to skip over a lot of ridiculous backstory, namely to do with work, anxiety, hate, relationships, and so on (definitely things I can write about, but later), we're going to skip to the part where I was suddenly out of work (circa 2014). Out of work, and mentally in a place where I was too afraid, too anxious to engage with the world outside. The most I'd do is leave the house to go down to the gas station for a pack of cigarettes, where even there I would have a man rush me to my driver side door shouting slurs and obscenities. After that, I stopped ... going outside.\n\n\n\nI broke away from almost everyone, and everything, save parts of my immediate family, but I still needed to make money. If anything, to pay off bills, and buy things I wanted and needed, so ...\n\n\n\nI logged into the virtual world, Second Life, and I made a few friends, a few enemies, and I started my own store within its world. I did this largely because of a single video I saw on Youtube about a woman who had lost her job, and was able to make back her lost salary through the creation of virtual items. That video, today, is impossible to find amidst a sea of people pushing their own similar videos, or unrelated videos about Second Life, in-general. So here's the second video I watched that contributed to the idea-having that resulted in my now nine-year-old store.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fi1gA-Cb86E?si=hL01jiI5ciItgP4_\n\n\n\n\nSuffice to say, it was and is not as simple as these types of videos make it look, or sound.\n\n\n\nBut this post isn't specifically about working inside of Second Life, it's more about things I've posted about on social media that have gotten lost in the algorithms, or slid away hundreds of pages into the past that almost nobody will ever read, or care to read. This post is about my struggle to use my own learned skills to reclaim a salary, and live, as a transgender woman, and the failure that brought me to the possible end of my transition, and back to the offline world of regular jobs.\n\n\n\nWhen I realized that Second Life would take time, or just wouldn't be a salary worth rebuilding my life upon, I taught myself how to use FL Studio. And then I released album, after album, after album, as I got better and better at what I was doing.\n\n\n\nI saw a lot more support in this type of medium, especially through the now defunct and destroyed Twitter, and through the transgender community, and people who claimed to support it through the online Twitter synthwave scene. I was making waves.\n\n\n\nNote the operative words here, \"claimed,\" and \"was.\"\n\n\n\nThere was a time, right before it all came crashing down, when only for an hour, I was the bestselling synthave/darksynth artist in the whole scene. But only for a moment.\n\n\n\nAt a certain point, the mental toll it took not really having offline contact with very many people outside of family, not seeing other people and forming normal social relationships for about four years at the time, something switched in my mind. I became less outgoing, more defensive. And, for all intents and purposes, it served me well to be defensive.\n\n\n\nSince most of the big voices in the Twitter synthwave scene, including one named \"Czarina\" (really not hiding much having a stage name like that), and Nightride.fm, almost entirely out of nowhere decided to digitally cut me off, and cut me out, after I had spoken up and against exactly one instance of transphobia that was directed at me. I was silenced, I was blocked, I lost connections, contacts, and this also led to losing money, and support.\n\n\n\nEven the ones who claimed to be supportive were silent, and they are still silent to this day, years later, as it continues to happen to transgender people who haven't given up on everything that they are.\n\n\n\n(I'm not even going to talk about the myriad Mastodon communities that took me in and kicked me out the second I'd have a single transgression with a bad faith actor within their own communities)\n\n\n\nAfter all of that, which, I have given more detail on via my Tumblr blog, here, I sunk even deeper into this ... dark, and isolationist place. It seemed as though to me most people were not generally good. It seemed as though most people were malicious, and evil, right beneath the surface. Always hiding in plain sight.\n\n\n\nA fraction of this was also the cause of one Laurelai Bailey, who had spent years manipulating and mentally abusing me through online contact (but that's yet, another story).\n\n\n\nIt was after all of that, that I suddenly had one of the scariest things happen to me, in my whole life. And no, I'm not talking about that one time in 2016 when I woke up to the ghost of a woman standing over me. I'm talking about the late night of a day in early 2020 when I lost my breath. I was squeezing my chest, my heart was racing. I stood up from my chair, abandoned the music and Second Life things I was working on for the moment, and hyperventilated.\n\n\n\nI thought I was having a heart attack.\n\n\n\nIt turned out I was actually just having a panic attack. A stress-induced panic attack that I believe was a culmination of the years before that led up to most of my efforts meaning ... kind of, almost, nothing. Of course, they aren't nothing. My Second Life store still stands and makes sales in 2024. My music is still streamed and purchased to this day, and I'm still working on new music.\n\n\n\nBut that's not the end of the story.\n\n\n\nAfter I had that panic attack, again, something inside my mind just clicked. Something had to change. I had to shed myself of the fear and the anxiety, and I had to fix my life.\n\n\n\nI stopped taking hormones. I cut my hair off. I bought new clothes. I returned to the offline workforce and resumed being the man I was nearly a decade before. And then I repaired my credit score, I bought a ton of things I'd needed for years, and I got a promotion.\n\n\n\nIf you asked me, though, if I'm doing better? Physically, monetarily, sure.\n\n\n\nMentally, I'm still there. I'm still in the room, alone, working day and night, trying to rebuild my life. And part of me believes I never will be truly happy until the fruits of my own labor and creation result in the salary I wanted and needed. I may never leave that room, inside my own mind.\n\n\n\nI can't think of what I'm doing now as anything more than just temporary, until I'm a system administrator, or an artist, or a web developer, or a successful electronic musician.\n\n\n\nMaybe that's just normal, though?\n\n\n\nWhat I do keep asking myself, over and over, even if only once a month, is whether I'll ever return to my transition. If I'll ever go back to that, and feel welcome in the trans community, ever again. Because most of them definitely aren't there anymore. And I can't talk about things I experienced years back without people asking far too many questions, or, if you've seen Bluesky and its community ... without being relentlessly harassed and dogpiled over the notion that people shouldn't use the t-slur publicly and open, without warning.\n\n\n\nSo, four years on, since five years of near complete isolation, have things improved? Have they taken a heavy toll? \n\n\n\nI couldn't really tell you, to be honest. I've gone through five different reinvented versions of myself since 2020, and I'm starting to think I'll never reacquire my identity, and who I am. Or if I'll ever have those dreams that, in all honesty, are pretty simple. I can't even will myself to feel sad about any of it. Just, kind of a simmering anger. An anger that so many people took advantage of me, and forced me into a situation I'm not entirely sure that I wanted to put myself back into. Why would anyone want to completely change themselves, and then revert to the person they were before that, just to survive.\n\n\n\nBut we're here, and there's no turning back.\n\n"

In order to continue that tradition, but to keep it in the same kind of theme I've been rolling with lately: Liminality.\n\n\n\nI wrote about the Backrooms and how ominously cool it is, or at least some of it. It makes me think of what it might be like to escape to a world disconnected from our own. It also makes me think of The Stanley Parable, a really great indie title that came out over ten years ago in the golden age of gaming that has far, far passed us by (another topic, another time).\n\n\n\nBoth of these things share a common theme, and they also share a little bit of inspiration that was poured into the Apple TV show, Severance (I think this requires an Apple TV+ subscription, but I'm not even sure, I've just always been subscribed to the media group of Apple apps).\n\n\n\nNow, there are obviously many other things that the writer had in mind when this show was written, but I wanted to take to this post not even to really talk about the links in ideas in the two aforementioned forms of entertainment (even though that alone is really cool). But more-so that I'm really surprised this show won awards, and is a major success!\n\n\n\nAnd that the final episode of season one is a really, really mean cliffhanger. Usually I hate cliffhangers. Especially with shows going on multi-year breaks lately (if you punched me in the face and told me I couldn't react for 3 years I'd just be more mad).\n\n\n\nI thought Fallout was pretty good as I binged my way through it, but this is something else.\n\n\n\nIt's not superheroes, it's not sensationalized: It's just people working in an office with their brains disconnected from the outside world. Two parts of your brain with different experiences and memories, and they bleed together without you even knowing it. And your office is an endless sprawl of featureless hallways. It sounds like work, and it sounds like liminal hell.\n\n\n\nI think the want to have your freedom and your free time and nothing else is something a lot of people can relate to, though. And that's what's appealing about this show. Imagine if you could just drive to work, flip a switch, and then suddenly you're driving home! Woohoo! Of course, there are ... issues, with putting your brain through that kind of trauma, I would imagine.\n\n\n\nBack to my main point, if this were a movie, I don't think I'd believe you if you told me that it came out of Hollywood. Or that it was partially directed by ZOOLANDER (see: The Wiki).\n\n\n\nAnd yet, it was, and it is.\n\n\n\nI can't wait for season two.\n\n"

    "content": "Over the past couple of months, or, since the beginning of the year, I've been tinkering around with moving, completely, toward ActivityPub. From taking my Twitter activity and killing it in its entirety so that I can run my instance at mkultra, to replacing Instagram with my Pixelfed, to replacing Youtube with my Peertube, and also now, my blog!\n\n\n\nThe only real thing I have left is to find a Lemmy instance that I actually like, and replace my Reddit activity with Lemmy. Which, in all honesty, shouldn't be too hard.\n\n\n\nBut, why do all this? Why abandon the corporate overlords to have full and complete control over everything I post, and my identity online?\n\n\n\nI mean, that's it right there.\n\n\n\nI would like to migrate my Patreon subscribers, here, to my blog/website, since it does have tiered paid subscriptions (mostly just for financial support), but that's a whole other beast. I'm not sure how many of them would be comfortable doing that.\n\n\n\nFor now though, I think I'm happy with my continued migration away from corpo mumbo-jumbo. I believe the future of the internet is an open internet, while the corporations fumble around with themselves vying to retain users for as long as possible before they all discover just exactly what ActivityPub is, and how they can use it seperately from the moneyed-billionaire software.\n\n\n\nMeta is, of course, connecting Threads to ActivityPub, but I don't think enough people who are on there know, or care, about what AP is, or what it means to be on Threads vs. a Mastodon instance. I have, currently, a lot of mixed feelings about Threads connecting to Mastodon. I think it's great because it brings more users in and more potential contact and exposure with the greater internet, but it also brings in Meta's lax moderation. Meta's fever-pitch obsession with AI (see: theft, plagiarism), and potential for abuse (this is the reason why I've now decided to limit the instance to only the people I decide to follow from Threads).\n\n\n\nBut, like most things that sidetrack all of my thoughts, Meta's cloudy connection to ActivityPub is an on-going thing that my opinions and feelings about evolve over time.\n\n\n\nFor now, thanks for stopping by!\n\n"

    "content": "I keep trying to like Threads. I know, I know, this is a massively unpopular thing to do on the fediverse, but I tend not to do what other people want me to do until I've come to concrete decisions and ideas on my own, through my own experience. There's a lot of the internet, and on social media in-general where I think people just make snap decisions based on things other people say, without research, or experience, and I think that's bad.\n\n\n\nBut, every so often, I give my Mastodon instance a little break, a little time to cool off from my constant posting, and I switch over to Threads. And it feels refreshing at first, and then quickly devolves into me slowly losing every ounce of faith I ever had in humanity.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. You can find people who like the things that you like, or post things that you like, at least, but viewing the timeline, by and large, is cluttered, flooded, spilling over with content theft. It's LLM generated theft, it's people copy and pasting posts they didn't make in order to get quick engagement, it's people ripping stranger's videos off of Tik Tok and posting it to their own timeline on Threads to ... again, get engagement.\n\n\n\nTo me, it just makes me angrier the longer I stare at it. And that's how they get ya. That's how corporations keep you on their social ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThese things: Twitter, Threads, maybe even Bluesky--They're built to keep you engaging, no matter what kind of reaction you're having, at all costs. So the algorithm will continue showing you things that piss you off, because it keeps you logged in, because it keeps you generating stats for their shareholders. You can avoid this on Threads by interacting only with things you enjoy ... but only for so long.\n\n\n\nAnd, I think, after trying to like Threads for about six or seven months, I think it's time to stop trying, and just let it be whatever it might end up being. From the looks of it, they're poised to have an exact clone of Twitter, but without Elon Musk's name attached. And, I cannot stress this enough, the way Twitter was designed and used, was never, ever, good.\n\n"

    "content": "Major spoilers ahead for both Dexter and Dexter: New Blood, for those who still haven't watched either of them.\n\n\n\nI want to talk about the show Dexter, a piece of media that was on-track to be one of the greats alongside Breaking Bad (*cough* and the first two seasons of The Walking Dead), and then somehow shark-jumped in a lot of bad ways in its latter half (Dexter gets away with causing the murder of the police Chief, his sister finds out who he really is, but never f##king tells anyone, and then she DIES).\n\n\n\nAnd then came back again for redemption, and only made a half-shark jump.\n\n\n\nEither way you look at it, both of the writers gave us an ending they thought we wanted. An ending they definitely wanted, but I think it may be off-base to say that fans of the show wanted Dexter to suddenly get away in the middle of a hurricane and become a lumberjack. Or, that we wanted Dexter to be on the cusp of being reunited with his original unit from Miami, only to be arrested ... and then killed abruptly before that happens (it wasn't the worst ending, but it was abrupt, and deflating).\n\n\n\nI don't think I'm alone in saying that a lot of people, despite knowing that what he did was generally good for mankind, that those actions that were definitely crimes, should have seen the light of day, in the court of law. It would have been a magnificent full-circle. It would have finally put an actual face to the Bay Harbor Butcher. And seeing the reactions and how his former team DEALT with that, and what happened AFTER. That's the ending that never came, and it's how it should have ended, for the love of god.\n\n\n\nAnd now they're apparently working on a prequel show that explores Dexter's life before the events leading up to the first season of the original, and Doakes, the serial killer bloodhound.\n\n\n\nBut maybe I'm the one who's off-base. Maybe a majority of people really enjoyed seeing Batista suddenly find out that the person he was chasing for a decade was right next to him the entire time. Only for all of it to fall flat, just like Dexter did, with a bullet in him.\n\n\n\nI get it. It was actually a good ending to the entire series. But it was also an unfair tease that didn't deliver. Thanks for telling me that Batista now knows who Dexter is, and then ending the show, never to ever revisit that. Ever. Again.\n\n\n\nThank you. For real. It's 2024, and I'm still thinking about shows from 2008 because they're over, and they're never coming back.\n\n\n\nWell, at least Shepard's coming back in Mass Effect 4.\n\n\n\nRight?\n\n\n\nRight?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe though, I put too much energy into shows that didn't deliver. Maybe it's time I finally watch Twin Peaks. Surely that won't disappoint, right? I don't know much about it, but I'm sure, as a lover of the surreal and the liminal, it's probably pretty cool, at least.\n\n\n\nOr I could just keep rewatching Dexter and Breaking Bad until I'm dead.\n\n\n\nx x x x x\n\n\n\nIf you like to read what I write, or any of the things I do, consider clicking subscribe at the top of this website.

    "url": "/second life/2024/05/07/neo-machina-01-from-the-dredges.html",
    "content": "I've decided to start this kind of chronicle. Not really \"news articles,\" or a magazine, but since I am now, once again, running the city Neo Machina in Second Life, and at a rate that is more affordable, I think it'd be neat to write about it. To write about the happenings, updates, what's going on, or what-have-you.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year (about two months ago), I decided it would be best to take Neo Machina offline. I did this due to the fact that a full region, with 30,000 prims (relating to land impact of items placed) costs around 250 USD per month to keep running. This is a bit much for someone who is not rich, even though I had lots, and lots of space to grow and build.\n\n\n\nSo I did what I thought would be an \"okay\" replacement. I bought up some mainland and built what was basically just a single street of the city, and continued business ... which lasted almost two weeks. And I must apologize to the Linden Labs employees for being so finicky, specific, and restless about my creation.\n\n\n\nIt had to be the full sim, or nothing.\n\n\n\nFollowing that, I wrote to support and asked if it'd be possible to downgrade back to a homestead (a much more affordable option, but with way less space for expansion). They wrote back, and they gave me the okay, and even a few days grace period to bring my land impact (item placement) down to a \"homestead\" level, which I did!\n\n\n\nAgain, I have to thank the Linden Labs employees for constantly working with me, no matter how annoying I am, specifically, with Neo Machina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, as of right now, Neo Machina is back. Just, with a bit less space for placing items and builds. Which is fine! I've been working tirelessly since the weekend to bring land impact down considerably, and in doing so I was able to keep the newly added street on the east side of the city, plus the consolidated landing zone.\n\n\n\nNot only that, but I have been subsequently contacted by the creators behind the store brand Madpea for participating in their month-long scifi/cyberpunk item hunt. So far they have gifted me two full packs of hunt items to place in the city, and many people have come to see the area, and find the vials. It's been very surprising, especially considering I've never even spoken to anyone at Madpea before!\n\n\n\nOn top of bringing the city back online, I've replaced the public bathing area with a public pool with 3D water that splashes and moves with your avatar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for my secondary store (a branch of [REVOSA]), I've built a Backrooms themed section onto the side of the store that sits along the road east of the nightclub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely, if I cut my store down considerably and axed the newer street to the east, I'd probably have more land impact to work with, but! I value my creations, and I've decided not to kill off work I've done. The city itself took me months to build, and the new additions were meant to be new things for people to see. And even with a downgrade to the sim, to keep it within affordable levels, I will not remove significant portions of it.\n\n\n\nCan Neo Machina ever return to a full region? That depends entirely on my offline job, and whether my store within Second Life gets bigger, or if people simply sign up on my Patreon, or at the subscription page via this very website.\n\n\n\nYes, if people subscribe to what I do, working towards a re-upgrade is 100% entirely possible. But like with everything I do and create, this isn't required.\n\n\n\nI pay for my Mastodon instance out-of-pocket, as do I this website, and Neo Machina, and I am fully prepared for it to stay that way for the considerable future. Monetary support would be a happy and welcome surprise, but I do not expect it.\n\n\n\nI am, like I always have been, in it for the joy of creation.\n\n\n\nUntil next time, chooms!\n\n"

    "content": "If you're seeing this from the Fediverse, it's because I have my self-hosted Wordpress blog using plugins that connect it directly via something of a pseudo instance. Each post on my blog is also a post on the Fediverse, and although I can follow users from Wordpress, it's not exactly bug free, in that I can't turn off e-mail updates that rip and tear at my daily mail limits on SendGrid.\n\n\n\nThat's why, despite having every post via cmdr-nova.online fed directly into ActivityPub, I also have my own (managed hosting) instance, also on a domain that I own, mkultra.monster.\n\n\n\nI'm posting about this, because I want people to honestly join, help build a community, and maybe support my efforts to keep it rolling (right now, all of these things are coming out-of-pocket).\n\n\n\nWhat kind of community would you be joining and/or fostering?\n\n\n\nMKM is an LGBTQ+ friendly instance, loosely based around the concepts of community, connection, and the ideas of the old-net. But, most importantly, MKM is wholeheartedly and completely against \"AI\" (and nazis, reactionaries, and hate in-general).\n\n\n\nAny and all use, mention, or sharing of generated (plagiarized/stolen) material is an immediate ban, without question. This goes for any instance that connects to MKM. Obviously, being critical of AI/LLMs is not bannable and is encouraged! The more the heartless tech dudes have to face down the actual consequences of their joy in the destruction of creativity, the worse they'll feel. And boy, do I love making them feel bad.\n\n\n\nI'm also posting this, though, because, in the future (and possibly right now), I will (and do) need some help with moderation, and am looking for two people who may be interested, whom I can trust.\n\n\n\nToo often, I've joined instances in the past, and have butted heads with moderators and admins simply because they're bad at what they do. They invade your direct messages to scold you, they ban you for clashing with a troll, and so on and so forth. This is not the type of behavior a decent moderation team would engage in. A community moderator should have the good sensibility to be able to decipher easily who the troll is and who the genuine person is in an argument, or clash. A good CM shouldn't jump into your DMs to nastily wave a finger at you.\n\n\n\nI don't think these are tough guidelines to follow, but as I've said, I've seen this behavior, and I've seen those people continue to be admins and moderators in the greater Fediverse community, to the tune of no consequences whatsoever.\n\n\n\nBut joining MKM isn't about getting revenge on the bad community teams out in the Fediverse. It's about maintaining and creating a better one. One you can join, and know, that even if you have some bad days, or sometimes even terrible days, you aren't going to literally lose your place on Mastodon, and have to start all over again.\n\n\n\nI feel like the largest barrier between Twitter hold-outs and Mastodon, is that people feel uneasy about possibly having to start all over, again, and again. And trust me, choom, I've done it over and over. At least, until I erected MKM.\n\n\n\nTake all of this into consideration, and maybe I'll see you there! Just use the link further up in this post to check it out.\n\n"

Mostly because they’re usually unanswerable questions, i.e., things not worth talking about, or things I don’t feel like answering. Today’s prompt is all about public figures, and who I might most disagree with. One could say, Elon Musk! Or any number of megalomaniac billionaires, but I’d like to steer the topic in a different direction.\n\n\n\nIn a direction that addresses all public figures who push, shoehorn, and shove “AI” or “learning models” down everyone’s throats. I’m talking about every single tech company in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.\n\n\n\nNobody asked for any of this. Artists didn’t ask to have their work ripped off for cheap hallucinations. Writers didn’t ask to have their words plagiarized so that some guy with no talent can generate a blog post (which completely defeats the purpose of having a blog). Musicians didn’t ask to have their compositions copied and remade with uncanny valley vocals for YouTubers to get rich from.\n\n\n\nNobody asked for any of this.\n\n\n\nAnd yet … it exists. Or, at least it will, for the next 12-48 months, before data centers run out of power.\n\n\n\nAside from destroying creativity and human expression for fast profit, these LLMs, and I say “LLM” because artificial intelligence an unthinking algorithm does not make—besides from destroying the aforementioned things, “AI” consumes countries worth of power.\n\n\n\nSo we have crypto, we have NFTs, and now we have AI, all consuming planets worth of data and power to keep it all going, and for what? Because a million people think they’re temporarily embarrassed billionaires who might one day profit off the backs of people who did the work for them. Off the backs of people who gave no consent for any of this.\n\n\n\nBut it makes a lot of sense that this technology would come out of the tech world, which violates the consent of millions of artists and writers … considering that bubble’s relationship to women, and their rights in-general. But the tech world has always been simmering in fascism. It is, after all, one of the tenants of a fascist society to devalue and destroy the arts.\n\n\n\nIs “AI” a symptom of a sick society? Yes. Is it fascist? Possibly. Does it need to be destroyed down to the very last piece of circuitry, along with its sister tech that serves the blockchain? Also, yes. Should we jail the CEOs and board investors who shoved this all down our throats? Absolutely, yes.\n\n\n\nForever and always, human expression and creativity will come first, and we will set fire to the profit-driven psychopaths sitting in their bunkers amidst the ruins of Silicon Valley, circa 2077.\n\n"

    "content": "How have you adapted to the changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic?\n\n\n\nSometimes I save Jetpack writing prompts as drafts so that I have something to write about later, should I feel so inclined. Obviously, if I want to be writing, I should be writing more for my book (Dissolution Protocol) that I haven't touched in four months. But, it takes a certain mood for me to be able to get into the state of mind that I need for writing fiction.\n\n\n\nThat out of the way, how've I adapted to the changes brought on by the pandemic? It depends on what changes you mean? Have I learned to deal with most drivers on the road becoming more aggressive than they were pre-2020? You can't tell me that you, as a driver, haven't noticed it.\n\n\n\nI've definitely adapted to most smaller gas stations suddenly closing at nine or ten in the evening every single day, for who knows what reason, post-2022. Of all the things you might need in an instant, or suffer being stranded, a gas station is one of them. But I've learned to plan around my gas tank, and figure out which places are open should I need to fill up late at night.\n\n\n\nIt's seriously as though half the world has chosen to ignore that not everyone works a cushy nine to five desk job.\n\n\n\nBut that's always the most evident at the end of each week when the normals holler out, \"IT'S FRIDAY!\"\n\n\n\nI think, if I could say I've adapted to anything, it is the idea that any one of us could be gone tomorrow. It's not an idea that's far-fetched. It's not something you can really scoff at anymore and go, \"Yeah, okay. But not me.\"\n\n\n\nYes, you.\n\n\n\nAnd everyone else.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't even have to be covid. It could be a car accident, it could be a consequence of murder or abduction. It could be because a guy in the supermarket was mad about his tomatoes being rotten, and because aggression is something gripping this country by the neck, he could whip out a gun and go postal. \n\n\n\nIt could be, just because it was your time to go. It could happen while you're sleeping, you could suddenly slump over at work.\n\n\n\nIt could happen at any time, anywhere.\n\n\n\nAnd I think that's something the pandemic has really drilled into my head. So much so, I still struggle with ... finding my sense of self, ever since then. Every couple of months I feel like I'm trying on new personalities, trying to figure out what I like most, where I belong, who I am--before it's too late.\n\n\n\nJust like, I'm kicking myself every single day that I don't have my next book finished. But the drive isn't there, so I don't do it.\n\n\n\nJust like the clock in my head says it's ticking, it's melting away, and you're still not married, you still don't have children, and you can't even muster a proper conversation on a dating app.\n\n\n\nIt's the feeling of impending doom, I think, that I've adapted to most. With nothing more than the feeling of just being ... numb to it.\n\n"

    "content": "Share a story about someone who had a positive impact on your life.\n\n\n\nI'm grateful that this prompt graced my dashboard, because it's giving me the chance to write about someone who ... I think vastly changed my life without even knowing it. And even though he passed away in 2018, his influence remains in my life, even if his extended family has no idea who I am. That's okay. They don't have to.\n\n\n\nHis name was Edward Shaffer, or Ed, for short. We met when I was working for a retail giant in the area of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and through being coworkers we became friends. At the time, he was in his fifties, and he lived in Steelton, PA. If I remember correctly, he also had a cat or two that he spoke of fondly on a daily basis.\n\n\n\nThis is starting to sound like mourning, or a personal eulogy I've never done. But it's true for me, I don't really mourn. I just keep thinking of people who've passed as though they're still around. Just not close by.\n\n\n\nEd was writing a book when he and I were still in-touch, and although I can't remember the name, I do remember it being something along the lines of themes that sound a lot like The Blob. He never published it, not to my knowledge, and as far as I know, he also never finished it.\n\n\n\nThat's also okay, because I remember it. That doesn't mean I'm going to write it for him, but whatever he imagined, it still lives right here (imagine that my index finger is pointing at my head).\n\n\n\nBut all of this is more or less, a descriptor of who Ed was to me, and not exactly how he changed my life.\n\n\n\nYou see, when I was younger, and I mean like, in my early twenties, I wasn't a creator. I didn't really have a twinkle in my eye of an idea of anything I wanted to do. Except for a book. A book loosely based on some fantasy of a zombie apocalypse, because that's what I was obsessed with at the time. And, although it is published today through self-made means, and although if I were writing it today, it'd be a lot different--it exists because of him.\n\n\n\n\n\"It's pumpin' and thumpin' time.\"\nEd, PaxCorpus, 2013\n\n\n\nI was struggling a lot with the creative process. I didn't know what to do! How do you even write a book? How do you feel creative.\n\n\n\nEd introduced me to the concept of \"flow,\" and how to get it going, and how to only \"make\" things, or write, when that happens. And he was right.\n\n\n\nHe coached me, and he was my idea-bouncer for years. And for a while, and although we never had the chance to hang out much outside of the job, he was almost like family to me. I remember the last time we sat down, though, at a pizza shop, and we talked about all manner of things for well over and hour. I think at the time he was trying to understand me, and what I was going through.\n\n\n\nThe last time we spoke it wasn't exactly on the best terms, as I was in a lot of turmoil in my life, and in a way I kind of forsake him for things I don't even think I fully understood at the time. And for that, I'm sorry, Ed. I truly am. I know I can never say those words to you, and you can never tell me that I'm forgiven, but I apologize for making our last interaction a negative one. \n\n\n\nI wish I could have been around a few more years, at least so that I could have said goodbye.\n\n\n\nBecause it was you who taught me how to be a person who MAKES things. A writer, a musician, a designer, an ARTIST. That's all because of YOU.\n\n\n\nYou're gone now, and you've been that way for some time, and hell, I don't even know how to access your obituary, or where your grave site is. But you're alive in my head, and you never went anywhere. Not really.\n\n\n\nThanks for all that you did for me, and all that you continue to do. Until we meet again.\n\n"

    "content": "\n\n\nSitting here on a day off from work, not really gaming, not really doing much anything besides sipping a soda, and thinking about cooking up some noodles. There's got to be something worthwhile to write about, at least, right? Not according to a large amount of people who use Twitter, Threads, and other forms of social media with engagement based algorithms (an algorithm that shows posts to users based on how many interactions a post gets).\n\n\n\nYou've seen it a million times, insincere question-asking or insincere posting, in-general. Wild claims, wild statements, some of which those who do this don't even believe in, or agree with, all to garner as much engagement (attention, clicks) as possible. So they can ... maybe sell you something? Maybe make some money from Elon Musk? Fulfill a superficial need to gain as many followers as possible and never interact with any of them whatsoever, or even post anything worth seeing, or reading.\n\n\n\nEngagement farming is something that stems from clickbait, which comes from media organizations, such as any number of websites with a payroll and staff, titling their articles with teeth-grindingly annoying claims or statements that beg you to click to find the answer or fact they refuse to reveal in the headline. These many, many both fake and real article aggregators get paid via ads on their websites, so obviously that's where they want your eyes to be (much to the dismay of literally everyone).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I think you can trace click-baiting all the way back to the nineties with spam e-mails such as, \"Open this or someone close to you will die,\" or, \"Your computer has a virus!\"\n\n\n\nCorporate social media, and by extension, corporate internet, is all in a battle royale, fight-to-the-death for your attention, and over the past decade it's become a set of tactics that regular people (who view themselves as temporarily embarrassed celebrities) use to get you to click through to their profiles. To give them follows, and inadvertently increase their view and engagement statistics, which, if you haven't heard, results in money in places like Twitter and Youtube. But it doesn't even have to result in money. A lot of people deploy these types of tactics on corporate algorithm based social media just because they want to fulfill a vapid sense of celebrity status they wish they had (I could go on an entire separate rant about the problem with the existence of celebrities and millionaires, and the vomit-inducing culture of worship around them).\n\n\n\nBut are the people to blame? I mean, if corporate media has shoved this type of behavior down our throats for decades, is it of really any surprise that this has become one of the main ways people interact (or don't interact) on social media? Our society demands you have money, or you starve. Our society worships celebrities, and fame ... for no particular reason. It's just the way things are (for now). So, I guess, of course you're going to log onto social media and see everyone and their mom posting like a sociopath who doesn't believe in anything, just to get another click out of strangers they've never met, and won't ever care about.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe I'm bitter, maybe I'm not any better than anyone else. I, of course, would love to make steady cash from the things I do online. But I've also never, ever been any good at using scummy tactics to trick people into showing me support through engagement (if you can even count that as support). I've never been good at writing clickbait.\n\n\n\nIn fact, I've gotten the most support from the work I do, by simply sharing it, and sometimes making things that are cool and good. It would be unfair to say that this is a skill a lot of people lack, and that's why you see so much bot-like behavior coming from randoms who have no taste, or integrity.\n\n\n\nUnless ... they are all bots.\n\n\n\nNah, couldn't be. But what is true, is that the act of engagement farming is a real problem, a real \"disease\" of the internet. And I can only hope that one day I can look at corporate social media once again without wanting to scrape my eyes out with a spoon and stab my ears with pencils.\n\n"

    "content": "I'm kind of a weirdo. I have an account on numerous ActivityPub instances ranging from Mastodon, to Misskey, to a rather new one that replaces Tumblr, called Wafrn. And I'm writing this post today, because of something that I was made aware of via that new Tumblr replacement, AP connected instance: People are still sharing blocklists across the fediverse (see: activitypub, mastodon), but this time in a slightly more sophisticated manner via an app called The Bad Space, and one of its biggest contributors is mastodon.art.\n\n\n\nThankfully, you don't have to do all the research yourself, as someone has already done that, in order to provide legitimacy to claims that blocks on The Bad Space are largely based on personal grudges, transphobia, homophobia, and anti-anarchist sentiment (among other things that have nothing to do with people being fascist and hateful).\n\n\n\nObviously, I would like to use part of this post today to advocate that you do not use The Bad Space as a replacement for your own judgment. But I'd also like to say that you should never, ever, use anyone else's judgment as a replacement for your own, especially when it comes to community moderation.\n\n\n\nI get it, sometimes doing the work is monotonous. It gets boring, tedious, and it's easier to just copy and paste the work someone else already did. But that's not good, especially in our current climate of general anti-lgbtq+ sentiment around the world. Where bad faith actors will do everything in their power to silence and isolate those that already hold very little social power in their own lives.\n\n\n\nCommunity moderation on open-source social media is no different.\n\n\n\nI've advocated before that Bluesky's method of user moderation, wherein users craft personal mute and blocklists, and then share them, is a recipe for disaster. Personal grudges become set-in-stone, and then normal, generally good people end up cut-off, and isolated, and some of them never even find out that the isolation is something artificial--Created by mini-megalomaniacs.\n\n\n\nBut this type of behavior, and lack of personal moderation, goes all the way back to Twitter's own Blockbot (which is now defunct) that emerged during the years of GamerGate. Where you could follow and download a curated blocklist (that was administrated by only a few people), and block out all the wannabe nazis.\n\n\n\nExcept the list had tons and tons of transgender women on it who have never, ever been guilty of fascist brain-melting, and were more just there because, again, admins didn't like them.\n\n\n\nThis is still not something many were, or even are aware of. Because when it comes to marginalized groups, it's harder to get people to pay any real attention. I should know. I have a lot of experience with this.\n\n\n\nEnter: Mastodon, the fediverse, activitypub.\n\n\n\nOwning your own Mastodon, or otherwise ActivityPub server, is an attractive idea. Build your own space, curate your own feeds, moderate your content, and never have to deal with overzealous strangers who want you to conform to extremely specific rules; strangers who might ban you on a whim for superficial, ridiculous reasons (it's happened to me!).\n\n\n\nBut that last bit is very important. Moderation.\n\n\n\nIf you aren't willing to do the work yourself, to personally verify what communities you're blocking and what people you're suspending, and I'm going to be very clear about this: You shouldn't be running a community.\n\n\n\nYes, there should be consequences for people and instances that create bad faith blocklists that others will use without even thinking. But you can stop this behavior, this act of wrongness, by being an admin, or a community moderator, who does the work themselves.\n\n\n\nIf you don't want to do the work, if you find it boring, you don't enjoy it, you'd rather use automation to replace your critical thinking, I'll say this one more time: You should not be running a community.\n\n\n\nI don't have an answer for how to stop miniature feudal lords from attempting to put up walls around the fediverse that keeps all those they've deemed undesirable out. But I at least know how to start deconstructing their little kingdoms, and it begins with you.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n"

    "content": "Earlier last year, when Musk restricted access to Twitter's API (see: X) and started charging for access to it, Reddit's team, and likely also the CEO, Steve Huffman, decided that this was a way cool and awesome idea. And, just like the nonstop shoehorning of AI into literally everything, most people were disgusted by the move. A move that also destroyed third party Reddit apps.\n\n\n\nThis, also, is what brought about the construction of Lemmy, an array of Reddit-like alternatives that serve as an ActivityPub replacement to the NFT and now AI littered battleground of ideas, former front page of the internet. I think there's a lot of work left to do in regard to Lemmy, along with excising the hipster-angsty \"Nobody but me can be correct at any given time\" type of dudes who most certainly exist there. But, it's still a completely viable and workable alternative.\n\n\n\nSo, what are they doing now, that is likely just a carbon copy of ideas they've stolen from the megalomaniac in-charge of what used to be the internet's town square?\n\n\n\nAI. You already know about Musk's \"Grok,\" which is basically just a copy and paste of source code from the OpenAI project, and you'd be a fool to think that everything people posting on Twitter (X) isn't being fed directly into it (and honestly, I don't understand how regular normal people are excusing this, as their words are plagorized by someone who can't even properly design a vehicle).\n\n\n\nVia Ars Technica, \"Stuff posted on Reddit is getting incorporated into ChatGPT, Reddit and OpenAI announced on Thursday. The new partnership grants OpenAI access to Reddit’s Data API, giving the generative AI firm real-time access to Reddit posts.\"\n\n\n\nNow, obviously, when you signed up for Reddit (if you ever did), you agreed to their terms of service, that likely conveyed something along the lines of, \"Reddit's dorky CEO can use all content you post any way they see fit.\" But, I am not fan of AI, and I'm not a fan of things suddenly changing while my consent has already been taken before those changes are made.\n\n\n\nAnd don't bother going back and changing every post you've ever made to something like, \"I do not consent to my written words being used for generative AI.\" Because they absolutely already have archives of everything you've posted, and editing everything just gives them more words to feed into the plagiarism machine.\n\n\n\nSo, what can you do?\n\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\n\nNothing but leaving Reddit behind, and joining the rest of us on the open internet. Find a place that respects your privacy and rights as an autonomous human being, on the ActivityPub fediverse, and forget Reddit ever existed. Because, at this point, it's just another corpo-sludge-trash dumpster fire that will, in all inevitability, eventually perish. Just like Twitter.\n\n\n\nYes, I keep hammering on about the open internet, and the fediverse. It is the future, after-all. A return to the way it used to be back in the nineties when we were all making our own pages, our own social circles, and all-around just being ... social. No farming for engagement, no race to get as many follows as possible--Just people being people, online. Maybe some weren't ready for it in 2017, but it's 2024 now, and corporations want everything you have, including your identity and your thoughts. Don't give it to them. \n\n\n\nTake back the internet, your privacy, your data. Maybe the corporations don't care whether they make any money, or retain any users. Maybe they're in a race to see how fast they can destroy the modern internet. But you don't have to be part of it.\n\n"

    "content": "Microsoft, founded in 1975, rushing to the death of its operating system with more bloat than me after a gallon of water and salty French fries, and also making sure we never have a winter with snow, ever again. It’s a tale as old as time: Plucky young lad builds a computer in Daddy’s garage, and then forty years later decides to be a supervillain, holding the entire world hostage demanding that his graphics card farms receive more power, or he’ll shoot the icecaps in the face.\n\n\n\nDo you remember back when you didn’t have to have an air conditioner running in March? Oh, those were the days, two years ago.\n\n\n\nI feel like this is the only thing I’m writing about. I’m not really working on my book, I’m not really putting anything new into my Second Life store. A lot of that is largely due to the fact that I have a day job, and it tires me out. Constantly. But I do happen to view social media a lot, and because of that, I’m forced to watch as corporations push the world further and further into destruction … for practically no reason.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s emissions have spiked nearly thirty percent since the beginning of the pandemic. A massive heel-turn after the world decided it was going to work toward lowering emissions. You know, so we can stop melting to death every single summer, and not die in 2040.\n\n\n\nIn the article linked in the previous paragraph, Microsoft laments that the world, and they themselves, aren’t meeting climate goals, and are facing “new challenges” as technology evolves. \n\n\n\nThe problem, is that the technology they’re talking about, is AI. If you’ve been reading what I write, pretty much daily, or sometimes even multiple times a day, you know how I feel about AI. Useless learning machines that plagiarize and generate slop that untalented people call “art.”\n\n\n\nYou might have seen, numerous times, over and over, as brands make posts on various social media websites and apps about image generation, or their new AI features (see: Mozilla and DuckDuckGo), and the response is always profoundly negative. Once you’ve seen it so many times, you start to think, “Hey, does anyone actually want this?”\n\n\n\nI mean, aside from the small percentage of people who have no genuine fulfillment from any other source, and therefore resort to using theft machines to make themselves feel good—who asked for this?\n\n\n\nWhy does Microsoft need to build new nuclear power plants to cool their data centers … for technology that seemingly nobody actually wants!?\n\n\n\nIt’s no surprise that most brands on social media have mastered the art of utterly ignoring any and all negative feedback to their decisions that they gladly share, without shame. Aside from, I guess, maybe Apple in regard to their ridiculous crushing press commercial.\n\n\n\nBut, I wanted to pose the question to these corporations that seem to be racing to the extinction of all humanity on the backs of artists and writers—stolen work and stolen words: Why? What is this revolutionizing? Did every single billionaire have an especially annoying college professor who scolded them for plagiarizing their essays, that they feel the collapse of Earth’s climate is worth their revenge?\n\n\n\n”We’re struggling to meet our climate demands amid new technologies!” \n\n\n\nThen stop. It’s literally that easy. We could be working toward feeding the poor and housing the homeless, and replanting forests. Instead, we’re stuffing cash into Nvidia’s pockets so we can build data center farms for fake photos of Jesus holding dolphins with 18 fingers on each hand.\n\n\n\nThe world has become a parody of itself.\n\n"

    "url": "/writing prompts/2024/05/18/prompt-work-life.html",
    "content": "How do you balance work and home life?\n\n\n\nToday's writing prompt is all about that work/life balance, and I feel like this is definitely something I can talk about, because it's something I've struggled with for years (and, you know, I have a job!). I'm not entirely talking about the past half decade before I re-entered the workforce, but I've generally been working since I graduated from high school. I started out in restaurants working as a dishwasher, a line-cook, and so on and so forth, and I didn't really have a lot of trouble maintaining my sense of self, and the life that I had outside those walls.\n\n\n\nBut something changed.\n\n\n\nSometime at the age of thirty-six, my identity as a person started to shift, and started feeling like it's been bungled around. I started to feel like I'm not really a person with goals and things that I enjoy outside the job. I started seeking out new interests, new hobbies, looking for anything to fill in this void where I felt my sense of self should be.\n\n\n\nThis continued for a long period of time. My life became working, and laying on the couch at home waiting until it was time to get back to working. This became habitual for well over a year, and my sense of identity continued to gradually slip away (I have considered that my issues and turmoil over transition may be part of this).\n\n\n\nI stayed that way for so long, that eventually I began to feel trapped, hopeless, like nothing mattered, and that there was no point in continuing to be, if all I am is a worker who sleeps, and then clocks back in.\n\n\n\nBut, instead of seeking out harm, something inside my mind switched around six months ago. Yes, six months ago to this date.\n\n\n\nI started focusing less on when it was time to clock back in, when it was time to get ready, when it was time to sleep, and just started focusing more on what's happening in each moment. I made myself, no, forced myself to be present in what I'm doing in the now, rather than what I'd be doing once I return to the job that, for all intents and purposes, is not something I wholeheartedly enjoy. Who actually really enjoys their job, unless they're a millionaire who can vacation six times a week?\n\n\n\nBut, if you want to talk things I enjoy, you need only look to my writing, my music, and the things I make in virtual worlds.\n\n\n\nI'm still working on rediscovering who I am, and maintaining my sense of self. But this is why having a healthy work and life balance is extremely important. It's not just about leaving yourself time to take care of home-chores. It's not just about leaving time for other people to be part of your life. It's also about giving yourself time ... to exist. To be a person, with wants, and needs, and interests, that have nothing to do with what the corporation you work for wants or desires.\n\n\n\nYou need this, because if you don't give yourself these things, you will end up where I was. Stuck in a void of thought, in a rut, spiraling out of control without even knowing it.\n\n\n\nYou have to be present. I'm not talking about putting the phone down and staring at the wall (although meditation is definitely also good for you). Use your phone if you want! Post on social media! But be who you are, in those moments, and don't tumble so easily into the work you do for a living, becoming the only identity you have. I don't want to say, \"It will become deadly.\" But I went so far to a place that I didn't want to be, that my mind became numb.\n\n\n\nFocus on maintaining this balance today. Don't tell yourself you'll start tomorrow, or next week. Start right now.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of work and life, you should subscribe to this website. In these times of ever-increasing prices, and stagnant pay, it would mean the world.\n\n"

    "content": "You probably read that title and thought,\"Dang, what did veterans do?\" But actually, I'm talking about vets, animal vets. Veterinarians. You know, those places you go with your pet when you've got no choice, and you don't want your cat or dog to stay sick, or worse, pass away. At least, that was my line of thinking when I took my old cat, Dora, to the emergency vet twenty minutes from here.\n\n\n\nShe wasn't eating or drinking, and it'd been at least two days. I'd seen this before in a cat I also adopted, and had for about ten years. I knew I had to do something for her, or I'd come home from work to something I didn't want to come home to.\n\n\n\nDora, days before I took her to the hospital.\n\n\n\nI only had the pleasure of Dora's presence for a year, but she meant as much to me as my long-time cat, Sasha, before she too, passed away. Sasha is buried under the flowers out back, and Dora's ashes are sealed in a wooden box on my dresser.\n\n\n\nWhen I adopted her, I knew she had health issues off-the-bat, and I knew how to take care of her. But a year passed, and her health started to quickly decline. I didn't want to leave, and come back to find that she'd passed alone, like my previous cat. I still feel bad about that. So, I did what any pet owner would do, and I rushed her to the emergency vets, because I wasn't going to have that happen again.\n\n\n\nIt was about 11 in the morning, I think. I put her in her crate, and drove off. The vets didn't give me any fuss, they took her right into the backroom and began looking her over. A couple of hours passed, they came out and let me know what was going on. She was having heart issues, and they discussed credit options. \n\n\n\nI continued to wait.\n\n\n\nA total of 11 hours were spent sitting in that little waiting room, wondering what they were doing with my cat. When they finally brought her out, they quoted me about 3000 dollars, and recommended I take her to the animal hospital another 30 minutes away. Wanting to be able to take my cat and get her the help she needed, I loaded up my credit cards and went.\n\n\n\nThe hospital took her in without issue, they said they'd be able to help her, although she likely needed some kind of heart surgery. They immediately started her on medication, and asked me what I'd be willing to spend. I told them I really couldn't spend more than 2000 (even though I really couldn't afford to spend anything, but that's what I had left on numerous credit cards).\n\n\n\nA week went by. I had some calls with the hospital and there were talks about her heart, and her organs beginning to fail. It became apparent pretty quick that there wasn't going to be a way to bring her home. At least ... not alive. So, when the day came, I went back and I spent a couple hours with her in a pet play room, and when they took her away to put her to sleep I still remember the look in her eyes. Like she knew it was time.\n\n\n\nI think that ended up costing me around 1700 total, cremation included.\n\n\n\nI have her now, here with me, and I want to be clear, I don't blame my cat for this. And I know maybe there are a lot of people who think it's ridiculous to place this kind of importance on animals. But my cats, are my cats, and they are living, breathing, and autonomous. They have feelings, even if primitive.\n\n\n\nThe people I blame are the veterinarians who gouge pet owners when they know there aren't any other options. Pay them, or take your pet home without care, and watch them perish, possibly even in pain.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, I don't think I've even paid off 1000 dollars worth of the debt they hit me with. I still have a long way to go. I'm writing this because I've set up a Gofundme, because I need to get out of debt. There are things I want and need to do in my life, that I can't do, because I'm anchored by this never-ending cycle of theft from every single paycheck I bring home, for something I couldn't control. Because I gave a shit about my cat.\n\n\n\nThe page is kind of slapped together, but I just don't know why I didn't think of doing this sooner. \n\n\n\nBut that's my story, the whole story, and I hope I can make it out of this. Because I also have pretty extreme car payments, direct from Carvana, the, \"We'll give you a 10-year-old car and hit you with payments as if it's brand new\" people. But ... that's a whole other story, completely unrelated to what we're talking about here, today.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read, and if anything, I hope you'll share this around.\n\n"

I just wanted to write about this Tumblr alternative that is ... uh, actually pretty cool?\n\n\n\nOf course, we all know that Cohost jumped out of nowhere and started sucking up the people who missed both Geocities and Tumblr at the same time. I know, I speak as though Tumblr is currently gone, and for all intents and purposes, it may as well be.\n\n\n\nLeft is nothing but a hollow shell of its former glory. Banning any and all not safe for work material, which, if you've been on the internet for more than three days, you know is the lifeblood of the internet. And then, more recently, the CEO came under fire for losing his shit over a joke a trans woman posted about his car exploding in knives, or something?\n\n\n\nI don't know, but he went on some kind of transphobic rant, and now Tumblr is dead-dead. Like, not cool at all.\n\n\n\nSo there was and currently is Cohost, but they're in this constant state of, \"We might not have the money to exist for another week.\" And I don't know about anyone else, but I hate anxiety. I don't like the idea of putting my words, thoughts, and possibly creations into a server that might up and fart and explode in thirty seconds.\n\n\n\nEnter: Wafrn.\n\n\n\nWafrn is basically the same as Cohost. It's setup just like Tumblr, except, like many things connected to ActivityPub (read about my instance while you're here), it's open source, and you can host your own copy of it, and also you can put the Pool Rooms as your profile background.\n\n\n\n\n\nLog on, post some stuff, and join in on ruining the internet. And, if you like what you see, you can also support the project and put a little bit of your coin toward a better internet.\n\n\n\nPosts work the same way they do on Tumblr/Cohost. You write a post, insert tags at the bottom, input media if you want, and then post! The way it works, is through the viewport while on Wafrn, it'll look like a more basic Tumblr, and then on the Mastodon side of things, posts just look like Mastodon posts. So, you can be like me, and have multiple fediverse identities, or an identity crisis! Whichever you prefer!\n\n\n\nThe community seems cool, and pretty tight-knit at the moment. But hey, that's ActivityPub for you (at the moment, since more corporate sides of the internet haven't yet opened the floodgates).\n\n\n\nBut why would you want multiple fediverse accounts across different servers?\n\n\n\nIt's simple. Why would you want an account on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Tiktok (circa 2020)? Because they all serve a different purpose, much like the way Mastodon, Pixelfed, Peertube, Lemmy, and Wafrn serve several different purposes.\n\n\n\nThe good thing about them all being connected together, is it saves you having to share whatever you're working on, over and over again, to multiple different profiles. Because it's already there.\n\n\n\nAnd you can set up accounts to be serious, to shitpost, to screw around and be unhinged and weird. Whatever! Maybe you want to have another account on some other Mastodon instance where you pretend you're a paper delivery boy who just discovered the internet. That's kinda weird, but you do you, I guess.\n\n\n\nThe point is, I kind of let the point get away from me by over-explaining why it's fine to have numerous fediverse/activitypub connected accounts. But!\n\n\n\nYeah, you should check out Wafrn and join us. Bring your Supernatural fandoms. \n\n"

    "content": "You wake up just like before. Maybe you passed out, maybe you fell through reality, or no-clipped as they like to say. But this time it isn't yellow wallpaper and damp carpet. It's white tiling, and rooms with oddly shaped pools, steel railings, and slide tubes.\n\n\n\nWelcome to POOLS, an extension of The Backrooms, or as the developer says, \"Inspired by the Backrooms.\" Although, most people know that the pool rooms are just part of the backrooms, much like the crimson forest, and the neighborhood (both of which can be seen in Kane Pixel's found footage series, along with glimpses of the pool rooms).\n\n\n\nWith water up to your chest and hoping to find some kind of exit, you're met with a black corridor, threats unseen. If there even are any.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's one of the things that makes this game so great. There are no enemies, or, I should say, no visible entities hunting you, or chasing you. There's no Xenomorph in overhead air ducts. There's no Nemesis waiting to burst through the wall, and there's no Howler chasing you down to rip you to shreds.\n\n\n\nIt is essentially a walking simulator. A liminal walking simulator. And that's what makes it so horrifying. You have only your sight and your hearing. There is no HUD. And throughout, you'll hear splashes from your own body into the water, your feet tapping against the tiles. You'll hear scraping in the vents, or the moan of a gaping chasm.\n\n\n\nNow, there aren't any strange entities visibly chasing you, but there is definitely something in the pools with you.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you remember the old days of the original Playstation, and the first time you popped in the Silent Hill disc, you probably remember the sense of unease. The feeling that something was very wrong about the world around you. And then you were slowly introduced to it.\n\n\n\nThis is the same thing, without the hot nurse monsters and the undead babies.\n\n\n\nThe fear is, for the most part, entirely in your own head. The game does such a good job of setting you up to be scared, that it uses your own senses against you. And I haven't even gotten far enough in the pools to determine whether or not something actually does ever happen. I just know that there is seemingly something going on behind the walls, up every dark hole (especially the ones you can't access), and behind the air ducts.\n\n\n\nYou walk around a corner and there's a ladder sticking out from a corridor higher than you can reach, and then something rips it away from your grasp. There's a pair of hands on another ladder that's submerged in the water, and before they vanish, an index finger points behind you.\n\n\n\nPools is a game about psychological terrorism, and I love it.\n\n\n\n\n\nI could spend hours admiring the architecture, wandering the halls trying my best to ignore the terror. Everything about liminal horror is what I've been looking for in the genre for so long, and I would give anything to make an escape to utter solitude and silence, for just a few hours a day.\n\n\n\nBut this is a title where the horror creeps up on you, very slowly.\n\n\n\nJump scares are cheap, slashers are boring, zombies are overdone.\n\n\n\nBut emptiness? Wrongness? Now you've got me interested.\n\n\n\nAround every single corner, you're expecting something to be there. That's what you're used to, that's what you've been taught to look for. And ... for the most part, there never is.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from our friend, Ducky. Yes, that's what I'll call him. But that's just the beginning, and there is much more. More than a rubber duck, at least (there are, apparently, more bath time rubber toys with eyes lying around). But I'm almost too terrified by this game, and simultaneously intrigued, and entranced, to advance too far, too quickly.\n\n\n\nI could probably keep going on and on about Pools, but I think it's best you probably grab it and experience it for yourself. Of the games based on (or inspired by) the Backrooms, this is a must-have, and will certainly win an award.\n\n\n\nI give this game a 27 out of 5 Novas.\n\n"

I didn't even put any thought into that.\n\n\n\nOne of the main comedic, or the best parts of the original film, Beetlejuice, were the Maitlands. Because they were just regular normal people who suddenly died. Regular, boring people who didn't really do anything remarkable besides own a nice house out in the country. I feel like removing that, kind of, sort of, removes a part of Beetlejuice.\n\n\n\nBut hey, we also don't have the full movie yet, and I'm definitely going to go see it while wearing a black and white striped shirt.

    "content": "Corporations chasing scams, what could I mean by that ... maybe, language learning model, or, non-fungible token?\n\n\n\nNowadays, or, for at least the past five years, the big tech world, i.e., Silicon Valley, Microsoft, Google, and even Apple in some cases, all have a different vision for the internet and technology, incongruent to what consumers actually want. I'm talking about the NFT bubble that came and went as fast as you can fart, and now the AI fad that arose from nothing in a bubble so big ... that when it pops, it will be devastating.\n\n\n\nDevastating to CEOs and board members, sure (who cares about them, though?), but more importantly, every piece of software and hardware you use in your daily life, because they can't help but shove an LLM into everything ranging from your social media, to your refrigerator.\n\n\n\nAnd then you have smaller examples of this, such as Apple's release of the Vision Pro, much to the \"Meh\" reception it got, because VR is still very much a gimmick that only offers short term gratification. But don't tell that to tech CEOs who surely think we'll be living in a virtual world in two years.\n\n\n\nThe tech moguls of the world have become out-of-touch, as if they're living in a completely different reality, separate from that of which regular normal people live in. Silicon Valley tech-nerds see a world where an LLM controls your morning routine, tells you how to tie your shoes, drives your car for you, and wipes your ass, and they've convinced themselves people want this.\n\n\n\nThey've convinced themselves people want automated girlfriends that are just machines wearing a human mask that spit out plagiarized, regurgitated nonsense that sometimes looks like sentences.\n\n\n\nThey've decided for themselves that, yes, people really do want artists to be replaced by machines that can't figure out if toes are fingers and if fingers are noses.\n\n\n\nThese people have absolutely decided that the \"dead internet\" theory is real, and everyone on social media should be a mindless robot driving pretend-traffic. An endless slog of bots, clicking on links generated by bots, pinging back to other bots, and putting money in the pockets of people who've replaced themselves with bots. Bots, bots, bots.\n\n\n\nAll that aside--the delusions of Silicon Valley--What do people actually want?\n\n\n\nAs someone who currently utilizes social media across different platforms, including Threads, Mastodon, and even a Tumblr clone named Wafrn, I can plainly see what people actually want.\n\n\n\nThey want functional search engines that don't suggest they put rocks and glue in their pizza. They want clean, non-ad ridden websites where they can read articles. Articles that aren't generated by a plagiarist's faulty machines that run on forty thousand graphics cards.\n\n\n\nThey want social media that isn't lying to them about the actual real people interacting with them, free of bait accounts and completely obvious, desperate engagement farming, that only exists to drive numbers and nothing else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd despite a lot of things I don't agree with in having to do with Meta, and their data collection, and their absolutely complicit rush into the AI bubble that is definitely going to pop, they are at least aware of some glimmer of this. Aware just enough, that they know it's probably a good idea to connect Threads to ActivityPub, where most of the people I'm talking about currently reside.\n\n\n\nThese people want what we once had, back again. Back in the nineties, when the internet was fun, when it wasn't overrun with corporate scams and constant ad-vomit. When the net was more just a place to build a page and talk with friends. When you could still call yourself a webmaster.\n\n\n\nA time when you could sign on, chat with your pals, play some cooperative games, maybe write a blog post, and that was fuckin' it.\n\n\n\nSure, you could order some stuff, but that wasn't the main focus of being online.\n\n\n\nThis clash of ideas has come to this kind of fever pitch level of ridiculousness where the moneyed oligarchs who control the world, and by extension, technology, and the internet, think they can tell the rest of the world what they want and how they're going to use their phones, social media, their computers, and the internet. To the point that it's come down to gaslighting millions of people into believing that, yes, I absolutely want generative slop that was trained on the works of artists who will never be paid.\n\n\n\nI absolutely want a robot to write the books I read, because everyone should be in a day-to-day nine to five, not writing books.\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\nOh damn, you mean that's not what people want? People want to go on social media and have civil, normal conversations with real people? They don't want an LLM eavesdropping on everything they type so that they can be better sold as a product to Nabisco?\n\n\n\nOh shit, man.\n\n\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\n"

    "content": "Do you remember life before the internet?\n\n\n\nWarning: Slight mention of an attempt at CSA\n\n\n\nI usually use writing prompts whenever I can't fully think of something concrete that I want to write about. I would like to write a short story, or a series of short stories, but story-crafting takes a lot more energy than just typing words. Despite how much of it I have in drafts.\n\n\n\nBut, today's prompt, is about a topic I can actually speak on. Why? Well, yesterday, I just turned thirty-nine. Yes. I was born in 1985. I have ... glimmers of a memory of a time before we were all connected.\n\n\n\nI remember sitting with my brothers as a child, a very young child, in front of a large wooden television. You know, the ones with the tube inside of them. And we'd be playing Super Mario Brothers together. It was a little house on the road down in New Jersey, and we had a neighbor who liked to skate on his long-board. Heck, I remember that house specifically, because every room was connected by doors in a circle, and you could run through it in seconds. But, I'm not writing this to recollect on the layout of a house I lived in toward the end of the eighties.\n\n\n\nMy Dad was a radio DJ, and there were things he needed at home to do his job. One of those things, was one of the first home computers you could get in the late eighties and early nineties. Now, I'm aware there were even older computers you could get or have, but I'm talking a DOS machine, that dialed into bulletin boards so that you could share your thoughts on a topic.\n\n\n\nThat was the extent of the internet we had when I was only five years old.\n\n\n\nBefore that, I don't remember a lot. I just know that what my brothers and I did consisted of simply using our imaginations, playing videogames that were not online, heck, they didn't even save our progress. And looking back at it now, it's hard to imagine or grasp how I didn't go nuts not having the entire world at my fingertips. But I didn't! I was a kid.\n\n\n\nI remember in another house, in the same state, one of my favorite cartoons were the Ninja Turtles, and we wouldn't even dress up like them, we'd just run around the streets of the neighborhood pretending we were fighting crime. Yeah, I remember all of that. I remember the large gash in my forehead when I accidentally ran directly into the side-view mirror of a car.\n\n\n\nBut then you had the nineties, and I can't really say fully that this was with the absence of the internet, because it was there, and it was in our house. But it wasn't some interconnected thing where you logged on and spent hours babbling about politics and your thoughts on quantum physics. Nah.\n\n\n\nThe very first time I ever had tangible, live connections to other people online, at the same time, in one space, was a thing called Worlds Chat in like 1995. It still exists today!\n\n\n\nYou would log on and pick a two-dimensional avatar in something that looked like it was built in the same engine as Doom. And then you'd walk around in this ... virtual chatroom, and just talk to people! That was ... until a man somehow figured out that I was a child using this chat program, and propositioned me in a corner away from other chatters.\n\n\n\nThat was the last time I ever saw Worlds Chat.\n\n\n\nI'm getting a little off-topic again, though. Mostly, life before the internet was a lot of phone calls, and no text messages. They didn't exist. There was a lot of reading maps (a skill that is surely lost on generation z and alpha), and phone books. A phone book! What the hell is that?!\n\n\n\nYou see, we had these big old books that got updated yearly, and they'd have everyone's name, address and phone number in them. And if you didn't know someone's number, you had to look them up in this book, a book that had literal yellow pages. I think you can see something like this in Back to the Future 1 or 2, and Terminator (I honestly don't know if they're still made today, in 2024).\n\n\n\nIt was a wild time.\n\n\n\nAs a kid without the internet, I spent a lot of hours just playing with toys. Making up scenarios in my head. Stretch Armstrong needs to fight the G.I. Joes, and win! Because ... Yeah! \n\n\n\nOr, I'd run outside with my brothers, clasp my hands together, and pretend we were soldiers shooting at each other. That was back before things got a bit darker in the world, and you really didn't want to just let your kids run wild in a neighborhood. But we did, we did that a whole lot.\n\n\n\nEven when I started noticing girls, I didn't really use the internet to ... explore all that. At least not until I was well into becoming a teenager. But, by that point, we had Geocities, and AOL Instant Messenger. Artifacts of the past I wish they'd revive. I don't think many people would object to their presence.\n\n\n\nI guess the gist of the story here is that, life before the internet was ... really simple. You didn't think about the war across the ocean, because you didn't really know about it. You didn't think about millions of people within digital arm's reach in devastating situations, or reaching the end of their lives, because you just did not know about these things, at all.\n\n\n\nThere was no such thing as engagement farming, or clickbait, hell, even spam email wasn't really a problem. Not at least until the late nineties.\n\n\n\nThere weren't Twitch streamers, or Youtubers, or Instagram influencers. \n\n\n\nThere was just ... people going about their lives, in an entirely different way that we, well, will never, ever see again. I couldn't tell you if people were happier back then, because I just didn't notice. I also can't really say whether it was intrinsically better or not, because honestly, I didn't really have a concept of all of this back then to really think about and compare.\n\n\n\nWould it be better if we didn't have the internet we have today, and people just kind of sat in their homes reading books and watching television? Maybe, but maybe not?\n\n\n\nBut that's just what life was, before the internet.\n\n"

    "content": "For as long as I can remember, probably at least since I turned 23, there's always been this march of people younger and older who have framed themselves as the deciders of what is or isn't cool for you to do or participate in depending on your age. Some things I can understand, you know, like, okay, you probably shouldn't be chilling outside the high school at 42. Why are you doing that? Put the cigarette out, it's 2024, and go to the mall or something (that is, if you're fortunate enough to still have malls where you live).\n\n\n\nBut I'm not really talking about predatory behavior. That's pretty much bad at any age. You can be 16 and a predator. You can be 53 and a predator.\n\n\n\nWhat I'm talking about, though, is normal stuff. Watching anime, playing videogames, or saying, \"Bruh.\"\n\n\n\nYou're 25, you're too old to game, why don't you own a house? You're 32, you're still gaming? Where's the wife and kids? You're 45, and you're clappin' people in Call of Duty? Shouldn't you be thinking about stock options?\n\n\n\nThe examples could go on and on forever, I feel.\n\n\n\nIt is for sure almost one hundred percent of the time a projection of what this type of person thinks they'll be doing around that point in their own lives. Or, at least, what they're afraid their life will be like: Boring, drab, minimal. Lacking in joy. Not saying that getting married and having kids is boring and mind-numbing, but it for sure will completely reconstruct you as a person to the point you may not recognize yourself in the mirror.\n\n\n\nMe, I have enough trouble recognizing who I am. Adding kids to the mix would be like ... You know what, I don't think I want to consider that right now.\n\n\n\nBut what I want to get at here is, basically, these things that some or a lot of people have decided are only for certain ages, or age groups: Gaming, cartoons, having fun, it's almost always in relation to things that gen-x and millennials grew up with. Things that our generations were the first to have.\n\n\n\nBaby boomers didn't have Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, and Evangelion, and Ghost in the Shell. Therefore, there really is no metric, or no basis to conclude that at some point in time, someone might be too old to enjoy these things. We're actually gauging that, right now! In the present! And a lot of people have decided, you know what? I'm gonna watch Demon Slayer at the age of 54, and you can't fuckin' stop me!\n\n\n\nI'm going to play Skyrim and talk about it on a Youtube channel, as a grandmother, and that's just fine!\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kWBiBBuKotY?si=Uy2T0T5CYMhtDZ9J\nShirley Curry, the internet's Skyrim grandmother.\n\n\n\nOne of my favorite Twitch streamers was a 69 year old Runescape streamer, named rsgloryandgold. Or, to his family, Tony Winchester. He was just a dude who logged the heck on, and did some dungeoneering. He, unfortunately, succumbed to cancer on October 12th, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is, if even the generation before me, and even gen-x can sit down and just go buck wild streaming gaming content on Youtube and Twitch, there's no such thing as \"too old\" to have fun with things that you have enjoyed all your life, and probably still do.\n\n\n\nRecently, on Threads, I saw a woman ask something along the lines of, \"I've just turned 31 years old, am I too old to stream on Twitch?\" (I tried searching for this thread, but there are actually many, many people on Threads posting about how they feel like they're too old to do this or that.)\n\n\n\nNo!\n\n\n\nWhoever is out there convinced that you've got to hang up the hat once you're really considered an adult, don't! Don't let the expectations of imaginary, or actual, just boring people, dictate what you do in your life, for fun, or even money!\n\n\n\nWe grow up, we get jobs, we pay bills, and then we die. I'm sure most people have asked themselves, \"Is this it?\"\n\n\n\nAnything that can take away from that cycle of madness, even if it's for a couple of hours, or fifteen minutes, is worth it. No matter how old you are. So whether it's a voice in your head that's been drilled into you through years of criticism, or just 17-year-olds on Twitter (why the hell are you on Twitter?) trolling you: Keep doing what you wanna do.\n\n\n\nYou know.\n\n\n\nAs long as it's not illegal, or harming someone.\n\n\n\nDon't do that.\n\n"

    "content": "What jobs have you had?\n\n\n\nKind of a loaded topic to ask which jobs I've worked. I have my current job, and it's a company I've worked for on and off for a lot of my adult years. But that doesn't mean I'm not looking at potentially finding something in tech, that's remote, and something I can put my laser-focused brain in. But, that's an ongoing search, and I have a habit of rambling into different topics when I've already got one set.\n\n\n\nBefore I graduated from high school, I started working for a diner that used to be kind of medium-big. The place was called Eat N' Park. It was like a fake diner. Their food was made with assembly instructions and everything was frozen. Ramsay would've hated them. It was my first job ever, the first place I dropped fifty plates in front of a bunch of customers who were eating, and the first place one of the line cooks asked me to his car for a drink--At which point I finished my shift extremely drunk, and potentially poisoned.\n\n\n\nI left that job.\n\n\n\nAfterward, I went off and started working at a local Pizza Hut close to where I lived in Steelton, Pennsylvania (this was the time when I still lived in a haunted house). I kind of liked that job, mostly because I'm a big fan of pizza. Nowadays, Pizza Hut pizza kinda makes me gag a little. They use way too much pan grease on their dough.\n\n\n\nI eventually left that job too, after the police raided the place and found out the franchise owner was using the delivery drivers to sell drugs.\n\n\n\nI wasn't involved, don't worry.\n\n\n\nAfter that, I started working for a steakhouse. Can't remember its name, but that was also a bit of a tumultuous job. I was still really young and naive, and my boss took advantage of that. I was the prep guy who set up everything for the salad bar every day. One day it rained real bad, and guess who got stuck on overtime mopping up the entire basement?\n\n\n\nMe.\n\n\n\nThat's not the reason I left that job, though. I ended up leaving after a dinner rush when I was ordered to chop a bunch of lettuce as quickly as possible ... and nearly chopped off an index finger. I remember squeezing my fingers together, and my boss kind of laughing asking if I wanted an ambulance. I decided to let my girlfriend pick me up, and I went the hell home. For good.\n\n\n\nThen, before I entered the company I currently work for, I went to work at a gas station in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. That job was also ... strange. Nothing in the store had barcodes you could scan when a customer was buying something. You had to ... memorize the prices. That was all fine and dandy, if at least a little tricky, but then my boss stuck me on the night shift.\n\n\n\nI think this was around the time I noticed my coworker, who got me into chewing tobacco for a short period of time, was doing whippets in the coolers at the back.\n\n\n\nBut the night shift, that was a completely different ballgame. I got to see the kids coming out late at night partying, buying up teas and cigarettes. You know, people who were my age. I also got a date from a girl who did figure-eight donuts in a Chevy Berreta around the pumps one night. She spent a few days with me until she decided to drop the bomb that she had ... an incurable STD (that wasn't the last time I saw her that year).\n\n\n\nThose aren't the worst things that happened when I had this job, though. I'd say the worst things were probably the much older customers who would come in at night.\n\n\n\nTo say I almost got robbed would be an understatement. I'm pretty sure I did, but by two guys who were asking me for money from my own bank account, and totally not the guy who came in and stared at me for fifteen minutes. I had to call the police multiple times in this position, and I'm pretty sure it was my fresh-faced naivety that stopped me from getting a gun to the face.\n\n\n\nThe potential thieves who were asking me for money from the ATM? Yeah, I'm pretty sure the dudes just wanted me out of the building. Again, I didn't realize this at the time, because I was just a kid, with no real world experience whatsoever.\n\n\n\nI ended up leaving that job after my boss got busted for stealing winning lottery tickets, while shorting my drawer every morning. She tried to pin that on me (she was arrested), and the new manager believed her. I got a lifetime ban from that particular station.\n\n\n\nBelieve me when I say this, I, in no way, ever stole anything from that place. I worked my shifts, I almost got robbed, I almost kissed a girl who had genital warts, and then I got terminated via never returning.\n\n\n\nMy first set of jobs were really ridiculous, and I got taken advantage constantly. I was just naive, not very aware, and that made me seem unintelligent. Things changed though, and I kind of became more aware, more vigilant. I don't let things get past me so easily anymore. I don't let customers give me the sleight of hand in retail settings, and I don't ask random girls on dates just because they know how to drift without exploding some gas tanks.\n\n\n\nBut that's how I entered the workforce, and I remember specifically trying to get my first job back (because I kind of actually enjoyed working in a restaurant), but my boss told me no. Not because I walked out the door, not because he probably knew I was silly-drunk one night, but because I didn't burn him a bunch of music CDs to replace what was stolen from his Jeep. Because ... I was totally responsible for that, right?\n\n\n\nWhen I tell you I was seriously taken advantage of, I mean it. If you're around the age I was when I rifled through these jobs, keep this sort of stuff in mind. The corporate world, whether it be retail, or food service, it is not kind to high school kids, or people who have just become adults.\n\n"

The dude on Twitter/Threads/Mastodon who posts forty-seven automated tweets/threads/toots per day about how you just need to push yourself a little harder, dude. Take your free time and turn it into passive income, bro! Follow these seventy-seven easy steps to financial independence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere must be some kind of secret cabal of social media coaches telling people that engagement farming (disingenuous posting) and unprompted financial advice, is a great way to garner followers. Except, it's not. In fact, I think people like this mostly just piss everyone off. And I can't, for the life of me, figure out why anyone would spend their free time posting things like this (especially on Mastodon, where there is no algorithm that rewards you for getting as much interaction as possible really fast). Why do you even care what other people are doing with their time away from work, John?\n\n\n\nIt's probably because it has nothing to do with that. It's all about putting up a veneer of false confidence and knowledge for follows.\n\n\n\nIt's always about followers.\n\n\n\nYou see, the thing is, you can use your free time to make extra money. That's a you thing, a decision you make for yourself, based on your own needs and feelings about your limits. But nobody should have to, and you most certainly shouldn't be urging people to do so.\n\n\n\nWe should live in a society where one job is enough to provide a stable life.\n\n\n\nThe thing about seeking passive income through doing more work in the little time you can spare outside your day job, is that eventually you will hit a wall. You will burn out, and if you're especially unlucky, the stress could kill you.\n\n\n\nInstead of urging people to hustle, hustle, hustle. Go faster! Make more money! We should be talking about self-care. We should be talking about laying the hell down, and just rotting in bed. Human beings were not meant to spend every waking second in the pursuit of money, so that they can fall asleep, and then never enjoy themselves.\n\n\n\nNobody wants to wake up at the age of seventy and go, \"Oh shit, I spent all of my back-pain free days chasing a dollar bill, and now I'm old.\" Because that's what it boils down to. The accumulation of cash ultimately means nothing, in the end. And, by extension, so does hustle culture.\n\n\n\nYou should spend as much time as you can doing absolutely nothing. Sure, go to work, do your chores, pay your taxes, mow the lawn. But, also? Throw yourself down onto the couch, and flip through Tiktok on your phone for four hours, who cares? RELAX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as anyone can tell, or know, we only have one life. And until we can prove that there is more than one life, do you really want to spend every second that you could've used finding a lover, or eating a slice of pizza, or playing a cool game, just endlessly trying to get rich?\n\n\n\nI didn't think so. Elon Musk isn't happy, Jeff Bezos isn't happy, and whoever the hell owns Microsoft now is so unhappy they've reinvented cyberstalking and burned it into Windows.\n\n\n\nSo, do yourself a favor. Take off your pants, crawl under a blanket, and turn off that damn brain.\n\n"

I'd say I mostly just push it to the back of my mind as much as possible, and that's just enough to allow me to sleep soundly at night.\n\n\n\nBut I'm getting too far ahead of myself.\n\n\n\nBack in around 2016, or 2017, it was so long ago now I don't clearly remember which year it happened, but I know it was one of those years--It was the afternoon, I believe, sometime during the end of Summer, or Spring. For whatever reason, I was a little bit tired, and I had the idea in my head at the time to give astral projection a shot. What better time to do that when you feel like you could use a nap?\n\n\n\nMade sense to me.\n\n\n\nIt started when I laid down in my bed. The instructions online said to look onward, and focus on one thing, and then allow yourself to close your eyes and drift off.\n\n\n\nI don't think what happened was astral projection, but it was something that crossed over from whatever state I was in, and into the actual, living, breathing world.\n\n\n\nThis is going to sound impossible, improbable, but with every bit of seriousness I can muster for you through text: This happened, and I can still see her face.\n\n\n\nI remember bits of the dream. I was lying in my bed, covers up to my neck, and I was in a bad state of mind. Something was wrong.\n\n\n\nThere was a woman in my bedroom with me, and she had long dark-ish hair, a sweater, or long-sleeved shirt of some kind, with jeans, and for unknown reasons, she was attempting to comfort me. Comforting me over ... things I still am unsure about.\n\n\n\nShe climbed up onto my chest, and she placed her hands on me. This wasn't anything sexual in any sense of the word. This unknown woman sat on my chest as if trying to reach into me. And she told me it was okay, it was all over, and that \"they\" were all gone.\n\n\n\nIn my dream, I began to cry. Whatever she was talking about didn't seem to sit well with me, it was ... considerably upsetting. That particular sentence, \"They're all gone.\" That's what shot me out of my sleeping state.\n\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, my room was now much darker, with only the illumination of my computer monitor lighting up the surroundings.\n\n\n\nAnd there she was, standing right next to my bed, staring down at me. She looked the same, but somehow darker, different ... wrong.\n\n\n\nAt that moment, I wasn't terrified. I wasn't scared. I was ... bewildered. Confused. Not exactly how one should react if suddenly you're thinking or seeing that there's an intruder in your home.\n\n\n\nI pulled off my covers and sat upright in my bed on my knees, and I flicked on the overhead lights. She was still there. I leaned in and attempted to wrap my arms around her, in some kind of effort to apprehend this stranger who was not only standing in my room, but watching me sleep. As if it was interesting, or as if she'd been projecting herself into my mind.\n\n\n\nIt was then that she turned from me, and while looking back as if I had scared her, she vanished through the closed bedroom door. Like some cliché version of a ghost in cinema who can pass through walls.\n\n\n\nI think I sat for a while after all was said and done at my computer, and I let it really sink in as to what happened. That's when I finally got scared. That was when the terror of the situation actually hit me. A severely delayed reaction for something so utterly strange, and supernatural, that it shouldn't have happened at all.\n\n\n\nI spent about a week restless, unable to sleep properly at night. I started staying up until dawn, and then, and only then, would I crawl into bed and drift into sleep. I was already a bit of a night owl, so this worked out for me. But this event has never left me. Much like the hauntings of the past that I experienced many, many years ago, it just ... became a part of me.\n\n\n\nLike the ghosts who toyed with me when I was sixteen years old living in a very old house. The child singing lullabies to himself in my closet. The faces in the window to the doorway when we'd leave. The objects moving across the floor in broad daylight.\n\n\n\nIt all attached itself to my psyche.\n\n\n\nWhen I sleep now, I sleep with my bed against the wall. I keep a cover over myself right up to my head, and I don't tend to concentrate too hard on what's going on when I'm trying to get what I need, so that I can go to work the next day.\n\n\n\nBut I still think about it. I still see her there at the side of my bed, looking down at me, as if it never ended. As if it's still happening.\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know why it happened, or who she even was. I don't know if I want to know.\n\n\n\nIf, after reading this, you're thinking I've written you some kind of little piece of flash fiction--I haven't. This is something that happened to me in the real world, as we live and breathe. And I have no explanation for it.\n\n\n\nIf you've ever listening to my music, this one event is what fueled me when I put this song together.\n\n\n\n"

    "content": "Today was the first day of a three-day off period I took from work as a late birthday ... thing, for myself. But, the first thing I did when I woke up, was I jumped onto my PC and started writing a guide to ActivityPub. Why did I do this? Well ...\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about AP, and Mastodon in-general. I see people saying things like, \"It's too hard,\" or, \"I don't want one account for everything!\" The latter is a misunderstanding, and the former is only a matter of having the information you need right in front of you.\n\n\n\nActivityPub software, be it Mastodon, Peertube, Pixelfed--they all have \"join\" pages, but there isn't much in the way of connecting them all together onto one page, so someone can find them all and look at them, and read them, and maybe even learn a few things about AP and all the software that revolves around it.\n\n\n\nSo, I solved that problem ... a little bit, today. And I hope it helps someone relieve their fear about jumping in, and getting at least somewhat away from the corporate slog of having ads constantly shoved in their faces while everything they write and create is scraped for soulless bots.\n\n\n\nOn the topic of ActivityPub, though, I received the unfortunate news that the Peertube instance I've been using for a few years are voluntarily winding down their instance due to, and in their own words, \"capitalism and climate change.\" I'm not entirely sure what they mean by that, but fair game.\n\n\n\nIn an attempt to keep my presence and my hundred-some videos on the Peertube network, I copied everything to infosec.exchange, and you can follow that account there! (If you want to.)\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, the reason I decided to write that whole guide in order to help people get away from corpo-social-media, is because Meta is in testing on Instagram with unskippable ads. Not specifically on Reels, but just ... on the timeline. While you're scrolling. Like some cheap smartphone app trying to make revenue for its sole developer.\n\n\n\nYou can read more about all of that here.\n\n\n\nBut what this is, is just another display of complete lack of care for the users who populate a piece of software in favor of the already fat wallets of investors, and advertisers. After a long six months of hearing and reading that generative AI is all about investors, I don't know about anyone else, but I'm sick and tired of whoever these investors and advertisers are, thinking they can just destroy all of the internet as we know it ... for a couple bucks.\n\n\n\nAnd that's why it's time to leave that behind. Maybe not all at once. Maybe in baby steps. But, the most important first step, is to try.\n\n\n\nTry to take back some of your identity, and ownership of your own data. If you can't vote with your wallet, vote with your presence, and leave these apps, and developers, to destroy their software in peace. Since most of these corporations seem hell-bent on burning down the internet ... for no reason.\n\n\n\nNo reason at all.\n\n"

    "content": "I'm writing this post about the music I've made and have been making since 2017, because it's been a journey. A journey of learning, mastering my style and skill, and even continuing to learn (you never stop doing that). It's also been a journey of loss, and hate, and sometimes anger, and after coming out the other side, it all continued.\n\n\n\nI've debated changing my music name from Eyeshadow 2600 FM to something else, but I haven't yet decided if that's a good idea, or not.\n\n\n\nTo start fresh, from zero.\n\n\n\nBut all those years ago (four now, I believe), I think that's what they wanted to happen, wasn't it?\n\n\n\nI'm writing this because, despite the bestseller status that my album, Ride Eternal, once achieved on its release, you can't even find it within the first twenty pages of Bandcamp dark synth.\n\n\n\nI'm not saying this is the result of some stealth cabal on the leftover dredges of Twitter-synthwave, but more because I spent about three years having decided I was going to give up. I was going to stop. And then after that three year term, I released Dissolution Protocol.\n\n\n\nIn relation to Twitter-synthwave, I've talked about these people before. I think I've written about them on this very website. Czarina (who once supported me on Patreon, and then tried to hang that over my head when I asked her friend to rescind a transphobic comment, and then began a campaign of hate that would never stop), Nightride.fm (who once played my music, and then joined in on said campaign, while they hid in their Discord channel exchanging snide comments), and those connected to them, the hate campaign they went on against me for my status as a trans woman at the time--the blacklisting, the blocks that were thrown at me from other streaming channels on Twitter, the people who didn't even know me, or what was happening, tossing their own nasty words into the ring. Words based on an image they had in their minds of someone they didn't even know.\n\n\n\nIt would be an understatement to say, at the time, that I was undergoing some heavy mental turmoil, and to have that exploited by an exclusionary club of men on Twitter who think themselves the dominant masters of Synthwave, when in reality they're nothing more than a forgettable group of nothing, on a now dead social media platform.\n\n\n\nIt all happened at the cusp of what I thought to be my music career, when I'd spent four previous years struggling to make money after having lost my job to, yet again, harassment, exploitation, and transphobia.\n\n\n\nIt's always a thing that goes around in circles when you make yourself open, and known.\n\n\n\nBut the thing I can't ever let go of, is that these dead-website-hate-mongers thought that they could stamp out my voice, and my work. They didn't. I'm still here. But they did this all to me at a time when I was struggling, when I was quite literally losing my mind. Isolation will do that to a person. And even especially the ones that put on a fake smile for social media, Julian, especially, knew this, and still added fuel to that fire.\n\n\n\nIn hopes of what? That I would disappear? Starve? Perish in a gutter somewhere?\n\n\n\nThe biggest offenders still haven't apologized, and I don't think they ever will. Narcissism has a way of convincing you that what you've done is a-okay, no matter what it is, and that leading a campaign to deprive someone of support isn't a big deal if you disagree with them. If you don't think transphobia is a big deal, or that the musician you rub elbows with was just joking when he said something disgusting with a digital sneer across his lips.\n\n\n\nBut I'm rambling now, I've written about this, I've washed my hands of it. I've made sure they never have to hear from me again, no matter how I decide I identify in the future, or where I end up falling with my self identity (which is far too unclear at this time).\n\n\n\nMost of these people are ghosts in the machine, and they've done this to countless other transgender people since 2020, of which I have verifiable proof, through a transgender woman I've been in-touch with for over a year.\n\n\n\nI've convinced myself there will never be justice, and these people, if they're still out there, will go on, believing themselves to be decent people. Decent people who deserve good things, and all the best in the world.\n\n\n\nBut I just keep thinking, if I write about it enough times, put the word out, and repeat these things enough times, maybe they'll have one consequence for what they've done.\n\n\n\nAnd then I can be happy again.\n\n\n\nBy the way, this was, in fact, me.\n\n"

    "content": "I'm sure most people are aware that Spotify is a streaming giant, and maybe even to some people, you're confused about this, right? iTunes came way before Spotify's rise, and it even offered a way to buy your music, and back it up. And then there was the whole iPod craze.\n\n\n\n\nThe iPod I still use to this day.\n\n\n\n\nAnd then ... suddenly, Spotify, and the idea of no longer owning your music, just ... took over. Because, reasons (because it was easy, and a lot of people like the feel of things being easy peasy)?\n\n\n\nFlash forward to 2024, well after Spotify vowed to stop paying artists who don't reach over 1000 streams per month, and the megalomaniacs are once again talking about reaching for your wallets. Much to the surprise of people who refuse to use anything else for their musical entertainment, of course. Because it's totally not like we haven't been through this with Spotify before.\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2023, Spotify increased the price of its Individual offering to $10.99. It also increased the prices of its Duo plan, Family plan and Student offering to $14.99, $16.99 and $5.99, respectively. The company said the market landscape has “continued to evolve” since Spotify launched, according to a release at the time.\nAshley Capoot, CNBC, https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/03/spotify-price-increased-again.html\n\n\n\nBut I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here, with people who stopped using Spotify back when they decided the people who provide content for their platform shouldn't be paid.\n\n\n\nWhat I am here today to talk about, or offer to you, is a solution.\n\n\n\nBandcamp.\n\n\n\n\"But Nova! If I buy stuff on Bandcamp, I have to use their proprietary software in order to listen to my music!\" You might say, having not really investigated all that much. But that's not true at all.\n\n\n\nOnce you buy an album on Bandcamp (and usually for extremely cheap prices), you can download it, sync it to your old iPod, or even better, upload it to your Mac, or iPhone, and then sync it with Apple Music! Voila, you can return to owning your music, without commercials, or ads, or shitty mega-corpos who refuse to pay artists, and rest easy.\n\n\n\nAnd you absolutely should be buying music directly from artists on Bandcamp, because even if they are being paid by Spotify, you would need to stream their music something like one thousand times to equal the cost of a single album. As an individual.\n\n\n\nYou may have caught me there in the last couple paragraphs, including Apple in a statement about those who DO pay artists, and that's because Apple does pay artists. And while it's only .01 cents per stream, that's still more than what Spotify was paying, before they decided to stop paying most artists on their platform.\n\n\n\nYou're probably starting to feel like you should ditch Spotify, and you're right! You should!\n\n\n\nIf you're like me, and you own a Linux PC, a Macbook, and an iPhone, and you want your purchased albums from Bandcamp to be available to you at all times, here's how to get them onto the cloud, and into Apple Music, fully synced.\n\n\n\nFirst, copy your albums to a folder on iCloud (if your collection is somewhere other than a Mac), then navigate to your Mac, be it a Macbook, or an iMac, and open Apple Music (you need to be subscribed for music match to work, I believe, but subscribing to Apple Music is now cheaper than Spotify).\n\n\n\nNow, with Apple Music open, click \"File\" at the top left, and then \"Import...\", and then simply select the folder where your digital music collection resides (even if it's on iCloud).\n\n\n\nOnce Apple Music finishes figuring out what volume all the music should be, click \"File\" again, and then scroll to Library, and in the pop-out menu, click, \"Update Cloud Library.\"\n\n\n\nWhen that finishes, whip out your iPhone, open Apple Music, and then check \"Recently Added.\"\n\n\n\nYou can thank me later.\n\n"

But, with the direction of PLEXX, we're talking more of a slow, chilled out, horror-vapor sort of situation. That's not entirely too far off from the roots of what I've done before--synthwave, darksynth, ambient--and that's just fine.\n\n\n\nVaporwave is fundamentally different in its creation process, where, sure, you'll have instruments, but there is a lot more sampling involved. And with sampling, opens up the door for some ... fun.\n\n\n\nEnter, my upcoming album, disc eRROR 19.92 ~DE-LUX.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp for preorder now, mostly so that I can have the page visible to visitors, but I entirely plan on having the album done by the first of August, if not earlier.

    "content": "A topic that shouldn't be all that controversial, but is, anyway. The topic of whether the act of having kinks, or sharing them in an event typically revolving around the LGBTQ+ community (that is going to be shamed and persecuted no matter what, anyway, until our society gets to grips with the fact that people are unique), is good or bad. A lot of talking points that sound like common sense on the surface, but are really just the talking points of people who would seek to eradicate the aforementioned community, at all costs.\n\n\n\nThere was a time that, I too, thought that it was just total common sense that you shouldn't have your schlong whipping around on all fours at a public pride event, and then later, as I learned, and got a little bit older, and smarter, I realized that this is just a straw man. And even if it were something that was happening, who the hell cares?\n\n\n\nObviously, I have numerous claims of agency that allow me to speak on this topic, and if you doubt that agency, I would suggest that you follow me, my thoughts, and the way I've experienced my life just a little bit closer. But I'm not here to talk about myself. I do that enough on Mastodon.\n\n\n\nOur society is riddled with sex-negativity, and it's bursting at the seams. People are using it for engagement on social media, and they're using it as talking points to run for political office. In a society, like America, where sex is a bestseller, it's also a subject of constant shame, because we're ridiculous like that, right? People have sex! Oh, SHIT!\n\n\n\nBut this entire debate, that goes on and on like clockwork, every year, every pride, is about respectability politics, as summarized by this Vox article.\n\n\n\n\nOne of the things that LGBTQ people quickly learn when they come out is that the “sex and respectability at Pride” discourse is like the villain in a horror movie who is never, ever truly defeated, even if you burn the bones.\nAlex Abad-Santos, Vox\n\n\n\nWhat are \"respectability politics,\" though?\n\n\n\nThe idea that you must act a certain way in order to be accepted, otherwise you're tarnishing the fight for equality. Which, for real, is an extremely flawed point of view. As presented at the beginning of this post, people who want to persecute LGBTQ+ people are going to do so no matter how you act. Presenting to these types of people that you're \"one of the good ones,\" will only ensure that you're burned at the stake last.\n\n\n\nSide-tracking to myself for a split second, I can say this fully wholeheartedly is true, because those who toy with respectability politics were instrumental in my eventual removal from the Twitter-Synthwave community. As detailed in a recent post, because I stood up for myself against transphobia.\n\n\n\nBack to the topic of kink, though, you might be wondering, \"Does this mean Quentin Tarantino is LGBTQ+-aligned, just because he likes suckin' toes?\"\n\n\n\nNo, obviously not, unless there are things about him that I'm unaware of. I'm pretty sure he's just a straight guy.\n\n\n\nThe idea that kink belongs at pride, or that it's an essential part of pride, is because it is something that has been part of people who belong to this community for more years than I can count, more years than I can currently fathom with my burned-out brain-juice. Because sex is part of being gay, or being lesbian, or bisexual, or trans, or pansexual, and even asexual (lack of interest in sex is still an attachment to sex). It's a part of all of these identities just as much as it's a part of being straight. I mean, isn't that obvious? Do ya watch TV? Movies? Are we hollering about saving the kids from the evils of watching Pulp Fiction in front of them by accident?\n\n\n\nOh, no?\n\n\n\nOkay, so then it just boils down to an obvious hate for the overall LGBTQ+ community, and a talking point that's really easy to use to get those who do hate, riled up. That's all it is. And there are definitely well-meaning people who latch onto these talking points, thinking that it's all just common sense.\n\n\n\nBut it's not.\n\n\n\nIt's a psy-op, orchestrated by homophobes and transphobes, and hate-mongers. It's about dividing and conquering, a strategy as old as time itself. And in the year of our pizza, 2024, I think it's time to start breaking old habits, and getting smarter about this stuff.\n\n\n\nOkay?\n\n"

I don't have a whole lot to talk about, as updates and other things have been a bit slow due to my day job (it's always eating up all of my energy), but I still do have some news.\n\n\n\nFirstly, I'd like to remind all residents who rent in the city to please remember to ... come back and pay your rent if you're using one of the apartment or store spots. I'm not saying this just because I want your money or something, but largely because, right now, since the city is a Homestead, prims are being strategically used and saved. This means that apartments and shop kiosks that are rented are using those prims, and if you've decided to take up residence elsewhere, please do me the courtesy of indicating you won't renew.\n\n\n\nOn that topic, the fourth floor of the apartment highrise is now available to rent! Have you ever dreamed of living in a dystopian city on the verge of the apocalypse as the sun expands to an explosive conclusion? Well, now you can.\n\n\n\nCurrently, for all spots in the city, rent is 75 linden for 50 prims, per week.\n\n\n\nI had one resident tell me this was expensive, but she was coming from the reference point of renting space in a sandbox where you have no privacy or theme. So her opinion was a bit skewed. 75 linden a week for 50 prims is pretty cheap, if you've gone anywhere else in Second Life (especially places held by these multi-decade land barons).\n\n\n\nIn other news, I announced a while back that all visitors to the city were free to take photos (cyberpunk themed, preferably), and submit them to me (nova ayashi) to be hung in the city! I'm doing this because in a lot of other scifi/cyberpunk themed cities, I see a lot of photos hanging of random models found on Google, or things taken from videogames. I thought it might be cool to, instead, hang up photos of people who are actually in Second Life. So, send in your photos!\n\n\n\nAnd, lastly, I've been making some small updates to the city that I feel add to the creepiness factor a bit. Something ... liminal has been converging on select parts of the back roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is it for now! Thank you for taking the time to read about Neo Machina, and I'll see you there!\n\n"

Your words are your own, you've got your robots.txt files organized nicely in your root directories, and everything is peaceful.\n\n\n\nLife is good when corporations aren't trying to plagiarize everything everyone's ever written.\n\n\n\nEnter: Technology Worker Dude # 4,104,210, or, Maven.\n\n\n\nSometime earlier today, on June 12th, 2024, an OpenAI backed project, or social network with no likes or faves and only people replying, that is also heavily infested with AI generated crap, used some code to ingest the whole ActivityPub fediverse. Just like that. Without mentioning it publicly, without uttering a single word.\n\n\n\nJust sucked it all up like a vacuum fed into a garbage disposal.\n\n\n\nExcept that garbage disposal is the network feed of a website that is definitely not federating over ActivityPub.\n\n\n\nAs quoted in this article:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to pulling in posts, the import process seems to be running AI sentiment analysis to add tags and relational data after content reaches Maven’s servers. This is a core part of Maven’s product: instead of follows or likes, a model trains itself on its own data in an attempt to surface unique content algorithmically.\n\n\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Maven received 2 million dollars in funding from former Twitter CEO Ev Williams and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\nSean Tilley, wedistribute.org\n\n\n\nIf you can make heads or tails of what exactly this guy's AI was doing with all of our posts from Mastodon, I applaud you. Because it's complete gibberish to me.\n\n\n\nTaking out the dopamine feeding parts of a social network is already kind of a weird decision, but building one based around violating consent, I mean, I guess we all saw this coming. As I've said before, a lot of the tech world hates consent.\n\n\n\nThe people behind this have since halted ingestion and deleted everything that was scraped, for now. They haven't said they weren't going to do it again the second nobody's looking.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear from the feedback on this thread that even our experiments with the tech were confusing to users and didn’t fit with other people’s expectations of how it should work.\n\n\n\nWe are currently pausing this integration, at least until we can better understand how Maven can fit in as a good citizen of the Fediverse.\nJimmy Secretan, CTO, heymaven.com\n\n\n\nIt takes a special kind of AI-muddled thought process to, instead of spending five minutes investigating how ActivityPub works, you just hook up some AI and download the whole damn thing. And then act surprised when people rightfully tell you that's not how it works, and you can't just shove an AI into an open space and expect a \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n\nBut this isn't really a surprise, since they advertise AI-scraped sludge directly on their homepage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe that Midjourney is a great way to get started learning about generative art.\"\n\n\n\nYou mean, a great way to get started being a pariah that everyone hates. Sure. You put that on your main page as a focal point.\n\n\n\nI can't emphasize enough how much I would love if all the data centers containing the code running these things, across every network, just suddenly exploded. Take it all back to zero, and then put up a digital wall, like in Cyberpunk 2077 when they built a whole new internet that isn't infested with garbage.\n\n\n\nBut it seems, this will just continue to be a constant fight against greed, the death of creativity, and Sam Altman.\n\n"

    "content": "Amidst payment platforms such as Cashapp stating that their app is a bank, and not a platform for tipping, or gifting money (I actually can't remember where I read this, but I believe they said it on a social media platform), more and more are setting down restrictions on how you use their services with money you give to other people. Today's post is about Stripe. The next corporation in-line to commit a corporate self-own, or as the gamers would say, an Epic Gamer Move.\n\n\n\nDiscovered via this Cohost post in their May financial update, and Stripe's own terms of service, it would appear that content creation is essentially almost banned. Even if you're on a system that doesn't require pre-approval, like Wordpress, they require goods and services to be exchanged for the money you're receiving. And, you guessed it, it's entirely up to them to decide what constitutes \"goods and services.\"\n\n\n\nYou might think this only really affects OnlyFans creators, but, trust me, it affects most anyone, or at least anyone who sells things online, or does work for free, while accepting tips (like writing a blog).\n\n\n\nA lot of this is due to the fact that the government in the US has created a new threshold in that any extra income you make through apps like Paypal, Venmo, and Cashapp over 600 dollars now requires a 1099K form. Because taxing people who make under 50,000 dollars a year is what the government should be doing, totally not just taxing the billionaires who have all of their money in stocks and off-shore bank accounts.\n\n\n\nWhat these companies and apps are doing, is what I view as the lazy-man's way out. You restrict and ban gifting and tipping, and you don't have to deal with the IRS so much. The rich hate the IRS.\n\n\n\nOn this website, I've had a subscription link at the top that led visitors to a place where they could subscribe monetarily, directly on my website. And guess what, that was connected to Stripe.\n\n\n\nIn order to avoid any problems, such as my account getting banned and money being frozen, I will be simply linking to my Patreon from here on out. Patreon already does tax forms, and it's easy enough to \"tip\" someone by just doing a small subscription for one month.\n\n\n\nMy whole deal, was that I just wanted to bring everyone to something owned and operated by me, where I could accept payments, free of corporations taking pieces of that money.\n\n\n\nBut that's a pipe-dream in a world where billionaires are stealing every word you write, every piece of art you make, for their own profit, and ensuring that the government is taxing you, just in case you happen to make a pittance of cash from the work they (the billionaires) haven't yet stolen from you.\n\n\n\nBecause it is, after all, the overarching goal, to make sure everyone is working menial jobs they hate so that they don't have time to complain, or fight back. Each day, living on planet Earth is more and more the most boring version of a cyberpunk dystopia anyone could have ever thought of.\n\n\n\nHey, I mean, at least you can strap a hunk of plastic to your face and walk around in a videogame ... I guess?\n\n"

And, although they have a long history, in the past three to four years, they only seem to be acquiring studios, and also killing studios.\n\n\n\nBefore Embracer, there was Nordic Games Licensing, and THQ Nordic, names that are probably a bit more familiar. But the history of this company as Embracer is relatively short, as they continue to speak about themselves as if this is an entity that has been around forever, and also fairly well-known.\n\n\n\nSuch as recently, when they announced that Embracer Group was coming to an end, and splitting into three companies, they talk about this news, and themselves, as if they've done something. As if they're major players in gaming. But, if you look back, the only thing of note that Embracer Group has done is destroy the studios behind Saints Row, Time Splitters, and now also Alone in the Dark (there are more studios than this that they've killed). All this, while making cuts to staff at Crystal Dynamics, and cancelling a new Deus Ex game, while selling off Saber Interactive and Gearbox Studios (among many other things).\n\n\n\nIt's starting to look like Embracer is a studio-laundering company.\n\n\n\nThey say, \"We can't make all the games we want to make.\" And I continue to ask the question, \"what games have you made?\"\n\n\n\nSure, there was THQ Nordic, but that's a thing of the past now. This is Embracer we're talking about.\n\n\n\nWhat exactly have you done, as a company?\n\n\n\nIt couldn't possibly be about inflating their stocks, since they're actually sinking themselves as we speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://companiesmarketcap.com/embracer/marketcap\n\n\n\nIs Embracer just a bunch of amateurs with delusions of grandeur? I don't know, probably.\n\n\n\nBut, this speaks to the gaming business as a whole, right now, and it would be unfair to say Embracer is the only company that's conducting themselves like a studio-slaughter-house.\n\n\n\nIt would be unfair to write all of this without also mentioning that Microsoft, an actually well-known company, has and is killing other beloved studios. And they're doing it entirely to inflate their stocks.\n\n\n\nIn a world where the poor and the middle-class can't seem to get a grip on making enough money to be stable, we have these companies in entertainment that are grasping at straws for every imagined extra dollar that they can. And some of them, such as Embracer, are failing miserably.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, we have to sit here, and watch as the studios behind our favorite games are murdered in broad daylight, while they attempt to restructure, to cover their tracks, to rehabilitate their image.\n\n\n\nIs Tomb Raider next?\n\n"

    "content": "Write about your first crush.\n\n\n\nI don't know how many people remember their first crush, or the first person they liked. I mean, I guess it depends on when it happened, or at what point in your life you started noticing those you were attracted to. But, come to think of it, I'm not sure if this was even anything to do with attraction, because I was only in the fourth grade.\n\n\n\nIt must have been 1993, or 1994. I was born in 1985, so the years kind of match up with where I was, I think?\n\n\n\nAt the time, I was an avid Goosebumps reader, and there was a girl who liked to lend me her copies ... that I didn't take very good care of. I was an inconsiderate 9-year-old. I was also very bad at picking up on social cues, as I still am, in 2024. \n\n\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't like the Goosebumps-book-having girl, or, I should say, I didn't want her to be my fourth grade girlfriend, and I couldn't tell that she wanted me to ask her to be that. I was just borrowing her books, reading them, and giving them back. It was a beneficial friendship for me at the time, and that's all I saw it as.\n\n\n\nThe girl I did like was a girl named Lauren. I guess it was a crush. I don't much remember what she looked like back then, but that's okay. We were all very young children going to school at Millersburg, PA elementary. I don't remember exactly how long I had this crush, but I do remember asking her to be my girlfiend ... in the middle of the classroom, in front of everyone.\n\n\n\nI think this is where my phobia of rejection comes from.\n\n\n\nTo my question, she said, in front of the entire class, that I wasn't her type. Where a 9-year-old learned that phrase, \"You're not my type.\" in 1994 is well beyond my comprehension.\n\n\n\nIt was probably one of my more embarrassing moments as a child. My second most embarrassing moment was burning a babysister's coffee pot on her oven, just because I was messing around with the burner dials.\n\n\n\nFast-forward to around 2007 or 2008, by random chance, she showed up on my Myspace. It was like some kind of ridiculous coincidence. And I remember, I also found her attractive as an adult. But I think at the time she either had a boyfriend, or she was married.\n\n\n\nIt's not that being married is bad or anything, but I guess I had, for years and years, this image in my mind that she was the first person I was ever \"interested\" in, and that seeing her as an adult could have been a fresh chance at trying again. And that was all kind of deflated. I wouldn't call it devastating, she wasn't and hadn't ever been part of my life, but it's a theme with most of my relationships, that what I want and what I expect is rarely what reality is.\n\n\n\nWhere my first crush is, today, in 2024, is anyone's guess. Maybe she moved to California, maybe she's rich and living it up in some remote part of the world. Or maybe she's just like me now, thinking about crushes and past relationships and the nature of all of these things that bring us to where we are now...\n\n\n\nWriting on a blog about our first crushes.\n\n"

    "content": "I actually really dislike the phrase, \"content creator.\" It sounds like a bleached version of things creative people produce, made more easily digestible for the masses. But! That is the world and future we now live in, where everything is watered down in content, and also in language.\n\n\n\nWould you call me a successful content creator? It depends on how you look at it. One of my albums under Eyeshadow 2600 FM was a bestselling dark synth album on Bandcamp for a short period of time upon its release. Before I abandoned the NFT-arena (a long story, but I will say that everything I made here was drawn by hand, not by bots, and I did this alone), I got featured by the official Twitter account (pre-Musk).\n\n\n\nToday, I regularly get five to one thousand views on shorts I post on Tik Tok and Youtube.\n\n\n\nBut am I famous? Absolutely not. Is fame something that is required to call yourself successful?\n\n\n\nI don't think so.\n\n\n\nBut I do feel like, my own measure of success, and whether I am, will only come when I can financially stabilize and support myself only from things that I, myself, create. And, no, we are not yet there. Being a \"content creator\" is a long, hard road, especially if you weren't born into a million dollars.\n\n\n\nLately, I haven't been posting as much here (lately, as in the past week). It's not really burn-out or anything, I've just been working on yet another project.\n\n\n\nOver the past decade, Tik Tok, Youtube, and Instagram have all become a place for \"shorts,\" or short videos up to or under a minute (although, Tik Tok now encourages longer videos). And, for whatever reason, if you make at least slightly interesting content, and find a way to smash it into a short, people will watch it.\n\n\n\nThousands of people.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to be always transparent, and talk about the things I'm doing, I decided to start making gaming shorts, with the robotic voice \"Jessie\" as my narrator for facts and stories that go on top of that footage.\n\n\n\n  @cmdr_nova Fun facts for you on this Thursday evening! The more you know! #facts #gaming #gtaonline #funfacts ♬ Conspiracy - Kieran Rogers   \n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, this stuff is actually bringing eyes to my channels (I know it sounds like I just discovered shorts, but believe me, I have been aware, and am an avid Tik Tok user). And that's what intrigues me. Innocent, or even funny, little gaming videos, are bringing thousands of people to what I do. Obviously, the idea now is to keep on doing this, indefinitely. If this is going to bring people to my stuff, maybe to my music, maybe my website, and my writing, then it'd be foolish not to.\n\n\n\nOf course, I can't discount the fact that over the years I've received and still do receive a lot of support for what I do through channels on Mastodon. But, as bills mount, and debt continues, I've got to become more ambitious than I used to be.\n\n\n\nWhich means I'm also going to be returning to Twitch.\n\n\n\nYears ago, sometime in the 2017 and 2018 era, I used to stream Dark Souls 1 and 2 to a tiny audience, and it was fun for a time. But as issues arose, and even after attaining the affiliate tag, I kind of dropped off. Then my life greatly changed. And now, years later, I find myself in a spot where I need to do more. It's not a matter of want, it's that I need to explore every avenue I can.\n\n\n\nAnd I really don't think that's far off from the reasons why anybody else does any of this. We're all being crushed under the weight of a financial prison.\n\n"

    "content": "How do you waste the most time every day?\n\n\n\nIn today's writing prompt, we're asked how we waste the most time every day. I feel like this can be really subjective, and it matters most what you consider a \"waste of time.\" I feel like, if you're making progress toward a passion, or something you enjoy doing, then ultimately, that thing isn't a waste of time. But, there are definitely things that I know I could personally cut down on, in order to expand the amount of time I have to do things each day.\n\n\n\nSuch as sitting for hours scrolling social media, posting every once in a while, and then continuing. I kind of do this a lot when I'm in \"waiting mode,\" or when I'm nervous, or thinking about what needs to be done the next day. It leaves me feeling like I never have time for the things I need and want to do, but \"unpacking\" and just existing is something I frequently feel like I also need to do.\n\n\n\nMaybe in that way, I'm not really wasting time. I'm just recovering energy.\n\n\n\nI've always been kind of an introvert. Heck, I won't even write the first message to people on dating apps, even though I get matches all the time. And this has been one of the major driving factors as to why I'm still single.\n\n\n\nBut it's true, I need a lot of time to exist, and without outside interference or noise. I'm not sure why I've gotten like this, or how I became a person who needs a lot of me-time. It's just how it is now.\n\n\n\nIf I think back to my twenties, I remember I spent all my time working, drinking, and meeting girls. It took me nearly a decade to write a single book, and that was the only thing I was working on. I was unfocused, I wasn't really doing much to better myself, and then twenty-nine hit like a Mack truck.\n\n\n\nMaybe the biggest issue with time, is just that there's never enough of it to go around. You can't pause time, you can't rewind time. But you can definitely watch it move forward, with, or without you. And as you get older, it seems to go faster and faster.\n\n\n\nOne evening is spent having some drinks and scrolling your phone, and suddenly it's two weeks later and nothing significant has changed in your life.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, it's a year later, and you're still in the same spot.\n\n\n\nTime just keeps on going, doesn't it?\n\n\n\nI think the biggest waste of time is thinking about time. Because it's just going to keep flowing, regardless of what you do, and it's ridiculous to think that every single person should be making massive strides with every inch of time they have. Statistically, that's impossible. You need time to unpack, you need time to just, exist, to be human.\n\n\n\nThe idea of \"wasting time\" is something that emerged from a society that expects you to work and be productive until you retire, or die. And we all know what retirement is going to look like in thirty to forty years.\n\n\n\nEnjoy your time, however you see fit, while you still have it.\n\n"

Maybe some people followed and watched Dr. Disrespect. Maybe some synthwave creators who fancied themselves part of some obscure, secret boys club, were in his Discord building an exclusive playlist. And maybe some people hated him for his abrasive, sometimes homophobic or transphobic words, and actions.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe some people remember his first ban, which came after he filmed within a bathroom at TwitchCon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second ban came in 2020, with nothing but an enormous amount of secrecy, that erupted literal conspiracy theories about what actually happened.\n\n\n\n\nAfter a day of silence, Disrespect has made only a brief statement on Twitter, saying that Twitch has not notified him of any reasoning behind the ban. In the days since he was banned, speculation has run rampant throughout social media, but there has been no official word or credible leaks about why this ban happened.\n\n\n\nTwitch has yet to specify a reason or speak about Disrespect specifically. The company’s only statement has been a vague update regarding community guidelines and terms of service:\n\n\n\n\"As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.”\nDave Thier, Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2020/06/28/statement-respond-why-dr-disrespect-banned-from-twitch-for-mysterious-reasons/\n\n\n\nAnd now, four years later, we finally know why he was banned.\n\n\n\nDr. Disrespect exchanged inappropriate messages with a minor via Twitch's own software.\n\n\n\n\nJust after publishing the above piece, Dr. Disrespect issued a lengthy statement, admitting to inappropriate messages with a minor, though he denies that it involved anything illegal and pushes back against accusations that he is a predator.\n\n\n\n“Were there twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017?” Beahm writes. “ The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more.\nErik Kain, Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/06/25/dr-disrespect-makes-a-big-streaming-announcement-amidst-allegations/\n\n\n\nI'm not sure why it took this long for word to finally come out. Maybe Guy, or Twitch, thought the heat would die down enough that it wouldn't kick up so much dust.\n\n\n\nBut, I think they were wrong.\n\n\n\nObviously, Beahm is a predator, despicable. And I'm willing to bet what he details happened is probably the light beer version of what really happened.\n\n\n\nThe bigger question, I think, is why did Twitch keep this a secret, and why did they pay him?\n\n\n\nTwitch had these details, they knew what happened, and they kept it under wraps for four years. A website that's supposed to be rock solid, open to all, safe. ... kept a secret about a prominent streamer contacting a minor, inappropriately, on their own website.\n\n\n\nUh, guys?\n\n\n\nI think Twitch kinda fucked up here. I mean, maybe they were wrapped up in all this legality that Beahm keeps talking about, but you WOULD THINK, maybe ... They'd come out and be like, \"Yeah, he did this. That's why we banned him.\" You know, four years ago. I don't know, maybe there's more to it than that, but if I were in-charge, I don't think I'd keep secrets for the man.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n"

    "content": "I remember when I first discovered Reddit back in 2010, and spent hours and hours basically living there reading things constantly. I also remember when I started wanting to find places to share my work as an author, and then suddenly finding out that largely, Reddit as a whole, is extremely hostile to people who want to share what they do, unless they're already famous. In order to share your work as an independent artist, writer, or musician on Reddit, your work needs to already be known by the masses. Else you will be harassed, you will be moderated, deleted, and banned.\n\n\n\nAnd you might think, \"This is really only an attitude central to Reddit, and nowhere else.\" And for thinking that, you'd be wrong. In the years since, this kind of mindset has taken over spaces all over social media. One of the biggest spaces this thinking has infected, is, unfortunately, Mastodon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying details blotted out because this person doesn't deserve any more attention from myself, or people who read what I write.\n\n\n\nIn the post I did here yesterday, I was kind of going on about this conundrum I have where: I really like Mastodon, but I find it really hard to reconcile going all-in with the platform. Because you run into people like this. People who don't use the internet to share creative work, who aren't trying to build a career out of things they enjoy doing. Who don't use social media, partially, to share what they do.\n\n\n\nThey're here to post, fabricate uncharitable ideas about strangers in their own minds, and then log off.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there are a minority of people across the fediverse, like this person, who believe it to be some sort of capitalist, consumerist, corpo crime to engage in the act of ... showing other people things you're doing, or making. To the point where you're thought of as no better than people who post in a disingenuous fashion in order to get you to engage (see: engagement farming). Which, couldn't be further from the truth.\n\n\n\nI brought up Reddit in the beginning of this post, because this is where this type of behavior and mindset sort of comes from. An arena of people who don't want to know anything about you, or what you do, unless you're already at the top of the charts, already a celebrated artist, already an A-list author with millions of fans.\n\n\n\nIt's the least counter-culture way to look at things, especially if you're on a platform that is in itself, counter-culture. To believe that all the creative work and entertainment that's worth a damn are things the media tells you to like, and anyone using social media to share new things, that others might potentially like, is bad, and evil, and click-farming, parasitic behavior.\n\n\n\nSomeone on Threads was talking to me about all of this, and mentioned to me, they've probably muted, blocked, and suspended more people on Mastodon than they have on other platforms. And thinking about it, the same is true for me.\n\n\n\nWith an open source platform, run by the people, for the people, inevitably you'll run into people who are unsavory, unpleasant, and toxic, even. And that's just an unfortunate fact. But maybe that's the trade-off. You can be on Threads and be hit with hundreds of pornbot follows in a month, or join Mastodon, curate your feed, and sometimes be told that you're corporate scum for creating things that you enjoy.\n\n\n\nAnd, whenever I talk about these points and experiences, some people assume that I'm brand new to Mastodon, and that's why I talk about this stuff. But I definitely ain't. Like I said before, I've been dabbling in the federated network since 2017. I've run my own GNU Social instance, and multiple Mastodon instances.\n\n\n\nThe only thing keeping me from throwing corporate social media in the garbage, is the fact that I don't like posting things on Mastodon, and running the risk of being told that I'm scum for making things, wanting to share them, and maybe build some kind of following.\n\n\n\nBut maybe I just need to be even more militant about suspending people. I really don't know.\n\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/06/27/threads-vs-mastodon-the-trilogy.html",
    "content": "Just recently, Threads initiated phase two of their federation with the fediverse. Now, users on Threads can finally see posts from those replying to them from, say, a Mastodon account. For the longest time, you were simply sending your Threads posts to the Fediverse, and never seeing much info about who was interacting with you. Like firing a gun at a wall and hoping you hit your targets.\n\n\n\n      Post by @threads  View on Threads\n\n\n\n\nThose who use Threads, who are actually interested in the fediverse, are still waiting to simply just see posts from the aforementioned on their Threads timeline. The problem? There may not be much to see once that time comes.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of people across Mastodon and other pieces of fediverse connected software, that completely block out any and all federation with Threads, and within good reason. Meta runs Facebook, and Instagram, alongside Threads. They're very much a mega corporation that absolutely sells your data, and absolutely have ulterior motives in regard to what content they want to have shared on their platforms. Which, honestly, isn't much different than the motives of individual Mastodon instance admins. Save for the part where data is sold (that doesn't happen on Mastodon, at least not to my knowledge).\n\n\n\nAs for the instance I've been running all year, I've chosen not to block Threads. Why?\n\n\n\nThreads has decent people, funny people, people that are actually worth following. Sure, there is a lot of riff-raff, and garbage, but, back in the day when Twitter was actually okay, it was the same deal. And with Bluesky, it's no different. With individual fediverse instances, topics and themes are usually much more concentrated, or extremely specific. \n\n\n\nSo, if a nazi launches an instance, there probably isn't anyone worth following on there.\n\n\n\nMaybe now you're starting to see my reasoning. And maybe also why, I both run a Mastodon instance, and an active Threads account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith how specific things on Mastodon can be, it's really hard sometimes to find people I actually want to follow, topics I actually want to see, content I actually want to consume. But, on Threads? It's right there. And that's my major conundrum, to why I find it hard to decide whether I should just post on my Mastodon account, or not. And the second reason why I'm not really on-board with the \"#fedipact\" (check out this list where they color code anyone federating with Threads in red, which obviously means bad and evil and not good) and blocking out its influence entirely.\n\n\n\nI feel like, if I don't block Threads, and if other instances don't block Threads, it'll be easier to bring those people we actually want to see from Threads, to a better, healthier Mastodon instance.\n\n\n\nIf Facebook is anything to go by, I don't know for sure that I trust Meta not to throw the steering wheel out the window and let the site run wild with whatever the loudest users dictate.\n\n\n\nBut, this whole thing, at least in my own eyes, and with my own experience, and situation, has a lot to do with the fact that I'm a content creator. A very unconventional content creator, but I am one, regardless! I've been writing since 2008. I've been making music since 2017, and I also make little videos, I run a store in Second Life, I try to be interesting on social media, and sometime in the near future, I'd like to find some kind of tech related remote job.\n\n\n\nBlocking myself, or my entire instance from the mainstream internet would do me more harm than good. Part of that, is because it's so hard to find, and sometimes even reach people on Mastodon.\n\n\n\nI've been dabbling in the fediverse since 2017, and I've never had more than 200-some followers on Mastodon (maybe partially because I've had to switch accounts so much). But, on Threads, I've been there since day one, which is under a year, and I've nearly reached 1000 follows, and about half of my posts actually go viral. Sometimes, for no discernible reason.\n\n\n\nThis is something that's really good for someone who is actively trying to reach people on social media. This is something that could lead me to having the career I've always wanted.\n\n\n\nI'm not saying Mastodon is bad, and you shouldn't use it, you should! But I've yet to crack the code on how there are people on Mastodon that have over 500, or over 1000 follows. How'd you do that? Why don't my posting habits on Mastodon get me to the audience I'm trying to build, but the same habits do get me there, on Threads.\n\n\n\nSome people go online to post, and forget. I go online to post, and try to build a future. And that's the biggest reason I can't block Threads, and it's why it took me a considerable amount of time to finally swear off using Twitter (for the most part).\n\n\n\nA lot of people on Mastodon aren't really online trying to reach people with financial and career building goals. They're just there to share and have friends (not that there's anything wrong wit that, I would love to have a bunch of regular online friends again) so, to a lot of them, it's really no big deal if they're only reaching 1% of the potential social internet. But to me, it is kind of a big deal.\n\n\n\nThese are my thoughts, as of right now, though. They could change. Tomorrow I could let my Threads account go dormant and continue with my efforts to build only on Mastodon. Who knows! I don't, at least not yet. What are your thoughts though? Do you think I'm making a bad decision? Should I swallow my worries as as content creator and just focus on Mastodon?\n\n\n\nI would love to know what your opinions are!\n\n"

    "url": "/writing prompts/2024/06/30/prompt-have-i-had-surgery.html",
    "content": "Have you ever had surgery? What for?\n\n\n\nToday's prompt asks a very specific question, that should have a real clear-cut answer. I'm not even sure why I'm answering it, aside from the fact that I just need something to write about! So here we are.\n\n\n\nNo, I haven't ever had for real surgery, where they cut and stitch. But! This does remind me of the time I had pneumothorax, and the reasoning the doctors gave me for having it absolutely blew me away.\n\n\n\nIt was a long time ago, back in my twenties, when I'd just barely started working in retail. I was grinding the third shift and going about my day as usual: Throw freight, tear boxes, put things on shelves, take a lunch, do it again. I remember at some point in the middle of the night, I suddenly had a real hard time breathing.\n\n\n\nIn covid-culture, you'd probably call it shortness of breath.\n\n\n\nI distinctly remember telling my manager, \"Hey, I think I have to go to the hospital, I'm having a hard time breathing.\"\n\n\n\nAnd I still remember him saying something along the lines of, \"Well, if that's what you think you need to do.\"\n\n\n\nBecause, obviously, he wasn't inclined to let me go anywhere without some kind of pushback. I was supposed to be working the product to the shelves, after all.\n\n\n\nI did, in fact, believe that's what I needed. I didn't call an ambulance, I didn't call either of my parents to ask them to take me. I hopped in my jalopy of a car, and drove myself to the emergency room and explained to them what was wrong. And, for whatever reason, the next moments would be something that scarred me for life.\n\n\n\nThey sat me down in a waiting room that had curtains around it, where they'd do the procedure. It wasn't a real room, it was just a row of sheets hanging from metal poles in some kind of big, huge room.\n\n\n\nAnd then this freakin' doctor walks in, and he says, \"Well, strip down to your skivvies!\"\n\n\n\nI didn't know what the hell that meant. But I waited for him to walk away, and I took off all of my clothes down to my underwear (it turns out, after a Google search fifteen years later, that's what skivvies means). Then, a woman about my age at the time brought in one of those medical gowns patients wear, and she asked if I wanted help putting it on.\n\n\n\nI think I said yes because a lot of movement made breathing pretty painful. And, I guess that's why it seemed like I needed help doing this. So she assisted me in wrapping it around my body, and she got entirely too close for comfort.\n\n\n\nBut, that was only the beginning of things I would think about forever, and ever, in the middle of the night when my brain needs something to go \"What the fuck?\" at: This girl, pulling a sheet around me, staring down at my skinny underwear-ed body.\n\n\n\nWhat the fuck, indeed.\n\n\n\nShe left, and then I was all alone again, and I think about twenty minutes passed while I sat there in this gown.\n\n\n\nBut they came in with these machines and a tube, laid me down on the bed and I think there were like five of them. They stuck a hole in my chest, and ran that tube down into my lung. There was a lot of pressure, and I remember expressing that it was pretty painful.\n\n\n\nI remember the female doctor looking down at me and remarking that it's not that bad, as if she was me, and I wasn't me.\n\n\n\nLater, after the little procedure, that I guess we can think of as some sort of \"surgery,\" they asked if I wanted some kind of pain meds. You know, the strong stuff. I kind of chuckled, because I had no experience with this stuff, and I was thinking about TV shows where patients tried to trick doctors into giving them strong drugs so that they could get high.\n\n\n\nThey took my chuckle the wrong way and gave me some ibuprofen.\n\n\n\nIt didn't help.\n\n\n\nI spent about a day there, and when the doctor who shoved the tube into my chest came in to speak to me ... she told me this happened to me ... because I was tall and skinny. And, being a smoker at the time, a male doctor told me that if I didn't quit smoking, he'd have to chop off half of my lung.\n\n\n\nI don't smoke cigarettes anymore, I vape.\n\n\n\nWhen all's said and done, my Dad came and took me home, and then I had two weeks off of work in order to recover.\n\n\n\nNow, it's been about fifteen years or so, but Hershey Medical Center, or Hershey Hospital, in Pennsylvania, I just wanna know one thing: What the hell?\n\n"

    "content": "I wrote sort of recently about engagement farming, and how ridiculous, annoying, and bad it is. How there are people out there who will post things, not because they believe in it, think it, or like it, but because it's what will get them the most clicks and views. Either because they believe it'll bring in monetary gain, or because they have a severe addiction to the serotonin pump of getting likes in their notifications. And that, at the end of the day, it's money, and lack thereof in our current society, that likely drives people to waste their time on the internet in this way.\n\n\n\nIn the past couple weeks, I've spent a little more time on Threads. The only reason I have an account on the platform is largely due in part to the fact that I was banned from what was my home on Mastodon at hackers.town after a little over three years. At the time, I had briefly sworn off Mastodon, until I realized that federated, open source social media is still probably the only road forward online, even if millions of people still haven't convinced themselves that corporate social media is not good, and is completely designed to wear you down.\n\n\n\nBluesky is a different story. Their developers have decided to create a new protocol that ... uh, well, doesn't connect to anything but their own central server. And, after missing the mark about seven different times to garner mass amounts of users, I'm 99% sure Bluesky is not a healthy platform and will likely die out sometime in the near future.\n\n\n\nSide-tracked thoughts on Bluesky aside, yes, even after writing a few times about the issues I have with Mastodon, and how some on the fediverse view creators and artists through an uncharitable, and sometimes nasty lens, I don't think there is any other choice besides the inevitability of remaining on the fediverse.\n\n\n\nNow, with all of my initial thoughts as to why I wanted to write this post out of the way, what exactly am I getting to?\n\n\n\nIn spending more time on Threads over the past couple weeks, and briefly viewing Twitter here and there, I'm noticing now that because of engagement farming, whether it be a tech bro posting a bad opinion for the sake of likes, or forty-seven different bot-like accounts on Threads copy/pasting each other, or posting empty questions: I personally feel like it's becoming harder and harder to determine, on corporate social media, who's being genuine, who's sharing things they actually like and believe, and who's just saying whatever for disingenuous reasons. Who on Threads, or Twitter, is replying to something you said with genuine thoughts, and opening conversation in good faith, and who's intentionally fanning flames, and baiting you, and others, so that maybe in some mythical future, these corporate platforms pay them thousands of dollars.\n\n\n\nAnd it's in the past couple of days, I've realized, this is exactly why federated social media, run on software that is not designed and maintained by billionaires, is the only way you can meet and talk to people without having to sit for minutes wondering if a person is just using you for their own potential financial gain.\n\n\n\nIt's making me feel like, despite having met a few cool people who are genuine on Threads, it's probably best to keep corporate social media as a way to share things I'm doing, or working on, and almost nothing else.\n\n\n\nI work a stressful job, I spend a lot of time at home relaxing, and recovering. I don't have the mental ... space, to wonder if I'm making a fool out of myself by interacting with someone who wasn't being genuine. I'd rather not go through any of that. And then you have to worry about whether the person you're interacting with is even real. Although, I'm pretty good at detecting AI generated photos and text, it can still sometimes slip by my bullshit-o-meter.\n\n\n\nBut, if I'm feeling like this about corporate social media, then it's likely others are, too.\n\n\n\nI see, all the time, people saying things like, \"If Threads isn't a good place to be, I guess there's just no social media!\" and things about Mastodon like \"The only people who use that platform are tech obsessed dudes who hate women.\" And, I cannot stress enough, despite some of my grievances with people on the platform, that is by and large not true, and hasn't been true since 2017.\n\n\n\nAre Mastodon servers that are set up entirely and only for shitposting annoying? Yes. Are Mastodon servers full of dudes who breathe stock options and tech trends loathsome? Yup. Are these two things a reason to subject yourself to the disingenuous slog of a social media feed on Threads, or Twitter, in the hopes that at some point, someone might say something genuine, or disprove the theory of the Dead Internet? No.\n\n\n\nTime and time again, these websites: Threads, Twitter, Instagram, even TikTok, are themselves a stark reminder as to why these places are bad for your health. They don't need any outside help to prove this. They are, by virtue of existing, a testament to their own volatility. And I keep writing about these things in hopes that more people will someday go, \"Oh, yeah, you know what? Maybe I can put up with a few tech industry dudes who have bad opinions every now and then as opposed to every single person on my feed bullshitting for clicks.\"\n\n\n\nAnd that's the sauce on that, chief.\n\n\n\nI think, personally, I'm likely finished experimenting with corporate wasteland social media. It's like, oh boy! I got 1000 followers on Threads! And, without a doubt, more than half of them are probably bots.\n\n\n\nIt may be harder to gain a following on Mastodon. There may be people with severe issues that you need to block immediately. There may be entire servers full of assholes and jerks--But the difference is, you do have the ability to completely erase them from existence, at least from your own point of view. I can't really say the same for corporate social media, where reporting functions often lead to dubious or a lack of results. But hey, maybe that's a topic for another time.\n\n\n\nUntil the next time.\n\n"

    "url": "/tech/2024/07/03/serenityos-and-ladybird.html",
    "content": "\n\n\nI push myself out of bed at the bright and early hour of nearly ten in the morning. My cat jumps at my chest and threatens to eat my keyboard wire unless I pour him a can of his favorite morning food. After slapping on some clothes and feeding the orange ball of fur, I sit in the indented couch in front of my fifty-five-inch TV computer screen and mess around in AFK Journey for about an hour and a half.\n\n\n\nAll is normal and procrastinat-y, just the way I like my days off to be.\n\n\n\nAfter hitting a progression-wall in AFK, I kick on my PC and refresh the Mastodon feed ... to find that there is yet, more \"drama\" going on in the dev world (I despise the word drama, because it is frequently misused by white supremacists as a phrase and a way to downplay actual harm). Specifically, drama in relation to SerenityOS and its companion browser (now forked), LadyBird. Both are open source projects, both headed (previously, but not now) by one, Andreas Kling, who calls himself awesome on Github.\n\n\n\nFirst I see random toots, \"This dev is a jerk, an asshole, a douchebag.\" And I'm intrigued. What did this guy do? And then I see glimpses of male-aligned language being used in the source code of one of these projects, and the flat-out rejection from the aforementioned dev to address this in the name of keeping politics out of his projects.\n\n\n\nOof, chief.\n\n\n\nAfter a little searching via the Fediverse, since Google doesn't seem to be indexing any of it, and the guy himself is attempting to downplay and bury it via his own blog post (wherein he states that he is forking the LadyBird browser project and leaving SerenityOS), I'm bringing it here. Mostly because I greatly dislike when bad people try to hide the things they've done, and dislike it even more when others encourage that it be hidden, locked out, and forgotten.\n\n\n\nTo what ends do people do this? So that a bad actor can be harmful to another group of people in the future?\n\n\n\nAnyway, I found what I was looking for on Mastodon, and, just in case the post gets deleted in the future, we're going to go over all of it here, directly.\n\n\n\nWhat started the controversy is something so simple it's almost hilarious. The dev had been writing code into SerenityOS that assumed the operator was male.\n\n\n\n\n\nA pretty weird decision. Something as small as this can say mountains of things about the person who wrote it. You can insert your own ideas about their motives, and why they'd do this. I, of course, have my suspicions and what I would think if I saw this (that the developer probably hates women). But we'll just look at what he said, himself, when someone questioned this, here (screenshotting important bits so that information regarding these things cannot be lost).\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are, of course, some angry comments following this, but expressing these things solely on Github gives these types of people a license to hide and bury and deny.\n\n\n\nThen there was as second pull request where someone else attempted to make the pronoun adjustment, again, and it was once again denied. With quite a few more people expressing concerns as to why neutral language is considered a bad thing, or \"political,\" when it is definitely political to enforce that your code refers to every user as a man.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs someone who is very confused about their own gender, and isn't quite sure where I want to be or go in the future, I can attest to the fact that this is a very simple change, and shouldn't garner this kind of strange pushback.\n\n\n\nFor a third time, yet another user suggested changing \"he\" in the source code to \"they and them,\" which resulted in more talks about code submission policies and their rules in avoiding hot political topics and controversies. And, much to everyone's surprise, people are still confused as to why this is considered controversial (if you haven't noticed by now, at least a few of the people involved in the SerenityOS and LadyBird projects are probably unwell and not good people).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to not look like I'm just repeating myself over and over, here is another pull request where a user fixed the specifically gendered language, and was denied. And then another, where a trans woman is called \"spam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then one more time, in relation to their companion web browser, LadyBird, wherein a user removes white supremacist language, and is immediately shot down and locked for \"spam.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure there is even more to it than this, but with the head of these projects stepping down and forking LadyBird, I think it's safe to say that LB is likely a browser you want to stay away from. SerenityOS, on the other hand, may be in better hands without Andreas and his influence. I can't say that for sure, though, because, in just these little snippets I've arranged here on this post, it definitely appears to be a problem with more than just one person and their far right beliefs.\n\n\n\nAs many know, woman-hating neo nazis are a real and legitimate problem in the tech world. From the top, all the way to the bottom. You can see this in how generative AI treats non-white imagery, and you can see this in niche code written for an OS that probably less than a thousand people will use.\n\n\n\nRegardless, it is something I am very passionate about addressing, challenging, bringing to light, and keeping the bad actors from burying.\n\n\n\nI've had numerous abuses cast against myself from so many terrible people, it's hard to count, and most of what they've done has been buried for a long time, and will likely never be addressed--In music, in tech, and even offline.\n\n\n\nEven with surface level knowledge of what SerenityOS and LadyBird are, I wanted, and needed to put this here. I will continue to document things like this in the future, so that people who experience injustices online and in tech don't have to sit in silence and think to themselves, \"Are the people who marginalized me going to just be allowed to bury their grievances and continue, unchallenged?\"\n\n\n\nNo, not if I can help it. And, of course, I'm not saying that the hundreds of people currently talking about this on the fediverse aren't properly documenting this, or properly talking about this--they are, for sure! I just think it is also a good idea to have this stuff in one place, where you can catch yourself up and know what the hell's going on.\n\n\n\n'Til next time!\n\n"

    "content": "As someone who is very much into Linux and open source software, and therefore by extension, the fediverse (Mastodon, Wafrn, etc), you might think it's weird that I'd write up an article about how I feel Threads is doing versus Twitter. Thing is, I understand there are people out there who ... let's just say, need to be on corporate social media. It's the only thing they can envision themselves being part of. Like someone who always buys the expensive purified Smart™ water instead of just grabbing one of the Great Value brand bottles, because they somehow think it's healthier. Or more ... watererer.\n\nMe, I keep my foot in corpo-media because I am a creator and there are needs that Mastodon can't always yet fill.\n\nMaybe someday that'll change, and we can get a vast majority of the world on-board with user owned social media. I believe the building blocks are firmly in-place, and we're ready for them. But! Until then, there will be plenty of hold-outs who rely on mega-corporations for their ability to interact with strangers and share things.\n\nEnter: Threads, in comparison to Twitter, one year later.\n\nIt's no secret that Threads is a major point of contention on Mastodon. Some people, who pride themselves on extreme black and white thinking, will even call you evil for using Threads. I think those people need some professional help, or, at the very least, to touch some damn grass. I don't believe in \"guilt by association\" and I think every single person has different, specific reasons for why they do things, or why they feel they need to do things. Such as, being on Threads, and not Mastodon. I can respect that some people just aren't ready for that, yet.\n\nI mean, at least they're trying. At least people are abandoning Twitter. That was one of the goals when Mastodon launched ... to get people off of Twitter.\n\nBut, I've gone on about this before and have done so too much here and now. Let's talk about how I feel Threads is doing in comparison to Twitter.\n\nYes, people still use Twitter. I have mutuals over there who haven't even given any thought to switching to something else. Posting like nothing's happened. Like their timelines aren't filled with strangers intruding on their personal space with intentionally antagonistic garbage. But, again, people have their reasons ... I guess?\n\nThreads launched to a lot of hype, and quickly exploded to 100 million users. If Mark Zuckerberg is anything to go by, and he's telling the truth (we assume), there are something like 175 million active users on Threads.\n\n\n      Post by @zuck  View on Threads\n\n\n\nListen, I don't trust anyone who makes billions of dollars a year. I don't think Zuck is being entirely truthful at all times. But, some part of me thinks he's at least somewhat better than Elon Musk, in some kind of light.\n\nThis is a far-cry from what Bluesky can boast, in fact, I don't even know how many people are on there, but I know a few months ago it was maybe 2 or 3 million people. I do know that when I go on Bluesky, it seems more like there's 5 people there.\n\nOn Twitter, the Musk recently boasted billions of active user seconds. And, I mean, it's just my own inkling feelings, but if you have to put user activity under a microscope down to user seconds, something tells me there's a bit of hidden truths in there.\n\n\n𝕏 US usage reaches all-time high! 🚀76B total user-seconds in the US, beating the previous record by 5%.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 29, 2024 \n\n\nAnd it's no secret that many of the replies on Twitter recently have been revealed to just be bots utilizing ChatGPT to look like regular people. That's alongside the usual content on Twitter, which is just zillions of people engagement baiting all day every day, which all adds up to a hollow, and mostly annoying social media experience.\n\nBut, is Threads any different?\n\nSort of?\n\nThe algorithm on Threads is much like Twitter's, except the volume is turned to eleven. Any slight interaction with a thread tells the AI behind the frontend that you want to see more of that thing, indiscriminately.\n\nYou interacted with a generative art post to tell someone how much you hate generative art? Guess what, NOW YOU'LL SEE MORE!\n\nYou interacted with a thread about World of Warcraft to say how much you like the game? You'll see tons more of that, too.\n\nThreads is all about not touching the things you hate, and only interacting with things you enjoy. In that way, it can be good, but only if you have self-control\n\nWhich, admittedly, I have very little of.\n\nBut, Threads is also full of engagement bait and content theft.\n\n\n\nThe brains behind Threads have said that they're working on solutions to clamp down on this behavior, and at the very least, make muting these people easier. But that was at least a month ago, and it's still a growing issue on the platform.\n\nThere is also no shortage, like on Twitter, of people champing at the bit, waiting to sling some toxicity your way for not having exactly the same opinion on mundane things that they do. Which, unfortunately, is exactly like Twitter.\n\nI'm reminded of a post I made about DC Comics that I had to mute the notifications on, because it got near 20,000 views, and tons and tons of nerds telling me I'm stupid and an idiot for liking Batman and the newest Flash film.\n\nThat isn't something that happens on Mastodon very often, and when it does, I just outright erase their existence from my entire server.\n\nTwitter has its own AI, Threads ... sort of has its own AI, since it's linked to Instagram, and Meta has an AI. Neither of these things are objectively good, because AI sucks about 98% of the time. But I won't say I haven't tried the text based Meta AI, just to see how it responds. And, I have to say, most of the things I've typed into an AI, such as meaningless questions a Google search could answer ... were better off just being a Google search.\n\nGoogle's shoddy and likely future graveyard-fodder AI is another story entirely.\n\nTwitter has hashtags, and Threads has the ability to tag a single word or phrase in order to increase the reach of a post. This is where I have to give both Twitter and Mastodon a point, because I really do prefer the old school way of just using hashtags to tag subjects for people who are searching certain things. Meta's way of avoiding hashtags on Threads is weird, and I'm not sure if it even works well, and I'm also not sure why they're avoiding hashtags. Especially because, with full fediverse integration, there will be hashtags coming from Mastodon.\n\nFuture Threads updates also include an incoming content warning feature, which I believe is part of an effort to conform more with Mastodon standards. Which is actually fine, that's a good feature. This is also something Twitter sort of has? But it's mostly only for porn. Twitter has porn. Meta is more conservative about porn-posting, and I guess I can understand it, but there is value in not being so prude-ish. I mean, we are all human, after-all.\n\nMeta's more prude approach to \"not safe for work\" content has, I believe, at least something to do with minors who populate social media, and not subjecting them to adult content. But, I also feel like children should get the hell off of social media forever until they're adults.\n\nNo, I won't argue that point. Kids don't belong on social media. Go outside and ride a bike, motherfrikkers.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, and one year later after having launched, is Threads really any better than Twitter? At least, if you're one of those people who are afraid of, or don't want to use Mastodon?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, it's fine.\n\nAs long as you take control of your own behavior and content, Threads can be a decently pleasant place to fulfill your posting needs. It's not really a great source for as-it-happens news, but I believe Meta is specifically avoiding being a hot-spot for political content and news media, because they don't want to end up in a situation where they've accidentally influenced global politics and are in the hot-seat in front of the supreme court.\n\nWe all know how Zuck handled that last time.\n\n\n\nTwitter, despite still having at least some active users who aren't bots or people who exhibit NPC behavior posting nothing but bait all day, is a dying platform. Dying a slow death of disease and misfortune as its less-than-business-savvy owner shoves it into the ground like a horse that's been dead for five years.\n\nIf you refuse to join Mastodon, or are, for whatever reason, afraid of tinkering with open source software, just join Threads, alright? That way, in the future, once full fediverse integration happens, I can follow you, and we can have conversations across our chosen networks, and we can all just forget X ever happened.\n\nDeal?\n"

    "content": "I woke up on my day off like I usually do, basically just procrastinating for hours and hours. And then I logged onto Mastodon, and then Threads. I like to start off my day by doing some posting, like you do. And then I saw that, uh, well, the official Threads account is attempting to commit career unaliving.\n\n\n\n      Post by @threads  View on Threads\n\n\n\n\nIf you've followed along on the platform at all, you'd know that Threads has been very careful about controversy, politics, and news. So, it was kind of a big surprise to see them using the main official Threads account to promote works by one of the most transphobic authors in the world, who is constantly embroiled in hate campaigns on the platform formerly known as Twitter. So much so that even Elon Musk himself has asked that she ... post something else she's interested in.\n\n\n\nWhile I heartily agree with your points regarding sex/gender, may I suggest also posting interesting and positive content on other matters?— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 4, 2024 \n\n\n\nEssentially saying that while he agrees with violent transphobia, he wonders if the head of the TERF movement has any ... interests. You know, aside from what a stranger's genitals look like (I don't know why she doesn't just get a Pornhub account and put her addiction into a more private setting).\n\n\n\nThat the official Threads account would appear to endorse all of this, completely out-of-the-blue, and unprompted, is ... well, troubling. Especially since nearly every single reply to the thread is people trouncing Threads for being so tone-deaf as to make a post like that. Specifically, since we are in 2024, where the thought of Harry Potter and sorting houses should have been something that people stopped caring about over a decade ago, years after the series was concluded.\n\n\n\n      Post by @willforrestthewriter  View on Threads\n\n\n\n\n      Post by @bealeiderman  View on Threads\n\n\n\n\nOn that topic, I urge you to read a different book, such as Children of Time.\n\n\n\nBut, that was only the first, \"What in the actual Hell?\" coming from Threads, so far today. The second instance of oh-my-god-ery coming out of the platform, this time, isn't by the official account itself. Instead, it comes from a random with an average looking username, turning out to be an LLM, on a platform that is only a year old.\n\n\n\n      Post by @frank_william3191  View on Threads\n\n\n\n\n      Post by @frank_william3191  View on Threads\n\n\n\n\nNothing like the equivalent of botting your Twitch chatters on a social media platform to really put things into perspective here. Did a random user set this up as an experiment, free from the knowledge of the team behind Threads, or is this sanctioned by Threads themselves? Not entirely sure, either way. But that an account like this exists, and isn't or hasn't been flagged, well ...\n\n\n\nThis is something I'd expect to see on Twitter, a platform that died six months ago and is struggling to retain optics that make it look like an active platform, versus something completely new, that apparently has 100 million+ users. And now, you really gotta wonder, how many of them are bots without thought or feeling?\n\n\n\nAnd this sucks, because I just recently wrote up a post on here recommending Threads over Twitter, to social media users who wanted something new, but don't like the concept of Mastodon.\n\n\n\nIt's got me thinking I should move all of my activity, at least in text form, back to Mastodon, or, my personal Mastodon instance, exclusively. And just forget about this corporate mess of AI-bubble-obsessed tech leadership who can't see the forest from the trees.\n\n\n\nBecause, this is, of course, an issue that also resides in the user arena on mastodon.social. Wherein, a few weeks ago, I suspended a user from federating with my server, due to him being an account (from mastodon.social) that was completely maintained by ... you guessed it, a language learning model.\n\n\n\nBut this is a problem that reaches all the way back to 2016. The moderation team behind the flagship instance of Mastodon, does next to no moderation, essentially forcing any instance smaller than it to perform either constant suspensions, or they simply hit mastodon.social with an instance-wide suspension (which I have already done).\n\n\n\nBad politics and AI are infecting everything, and it is sadly becoming more and more prudent to hollow out your own space, and put up a firewall to keep the theft machines and the genital obsessed weirdos out. Why this had to be a double-issue involving both of these things today, is beyond me, but here we are.\n\n\n\nI put this post up in order to be fully transparent about my thoughts, and my evolving opinions about things. Yes, I have issues with Mastodon and some of the people who occupy the fediverse. I also have issues with Threads, and the questionable decisions Meta makes in regard to its health and development.\n\n\n\nThe question is now, do I still recommend people who don't like the concept of Mastodon to just sign up on Threads?\n\n\n\nI'm still thinking on that topic, and I'll get back to you. But, just in case this has you thinking you might want to look at Mastodon as an alternative, head on over to my instance sign-up page, and give it a shot! If I don't immediately respond to your user request, please feel free to leave a comment on this post.\n\n"

    "title": "Let's Talk About Zenless Zone Zero",
    "url": "/gaming/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero.html",
    "content": "No, I’m not being paid by MiHoYo to write about, or stream Zenless Zone Zero (or ZZZ). I felt like I wanted to write about it, because, as an adult who has to work, a lot, and is always out and about with less time at home in front of my PC than I am wandering the world: Mobile games have kind of become a staple in how I find a little enjoyment in the day-to-day usual activities.\n\n\n\nImagine one of those isekia animes, or gacha games, where you’ve got a new life running a store, meeting new people, and sometimes fighting monsters. That’s kind of what this game is. But it’s not. It’s a little bit like Persona kissed a gacha, and then gave birth to an Isekia, but one where you didn’t die and become reincarnated (or did you?).\n\nWhen you start the game, which you can play across your phone and then also on your PC, it’s the usual fare: Start it up, get a ton of exposition through dialogue, and then embark on your mission in quarantined little zones where you fight monsters. Then you’re introduced to the skill system, and eventually the gacha system.\n\nBut then, you’re also introduced to the fact that you own a video store, and you can open it for business. You can visit the coffee shop down the street and have a cup, or go on over to the arcade and play a plethora of arcade games … just for the heck of it!?\n\nAnd that’s just in the little town you start in???\n\nYou have a little van at the back of the video store that you can jump into and then “travel” with in order to reach other areas. So far, I’ve only seen the VR place, but there were, uh … quite a few other locked-out places to visit.\n\nAlso, did I mention, you can go to bed? For some reason? Like, you can put your character to sleep until the following day. I’m not sure if this is exclusively part of advancing the story, or if you can just do this whenever you want (I haven’t tried it).\n\nThere are other things scattered around the main area you frequent between commissions, too. Such as a gadget store (for increasing your character’s gear level), and a restaurant of some kind where you can eat some food. It’s got all these little details.\n\nYou know, when I launched ZZZ, I was expecting kind of a Honkai Impact sort of game. Nothing that would really rival Genshin, since it is their cash-cow, after all, but at least something that could be a neat little distraction.\n\nLittle did I know, that there is some kind of huge world built around this, where you don’t even have to kill anyone, or anything.\n\nOh, and sometimes you can spend money to roll for new characters to collect.\n\nDid you know … MiHoYo is using money they make from these games in order to fund a nuclear fusion reactor? I don’t really spend a lot of money in these types of games, but it is fascinating that, when I choose to, I’m kinda sorta, pretty much funding future clean energy.\n\nWhether that energy is used for good, or for the destruction of creativity through LLMs, is yet to be determined. But … I am under the impression that the devs behind Genshin, ZZZ, and Star Rail, are using actual artists, with skills they employ through use of their hands and tools … even if they are, sometimes, a little bit, uh …\n\n\n\nAnyway! It’s also got this cyberpunk vibe, but like, with technology from the present, the apparent future, and also the past. I mean, I’m pretty sure you’re renting out VHS tapes, and checking notifications on an advanced smartphone at the same time. So, it would seem, this is some kind of future where we still romanticize the eighties, but are very much involved in embracing the tech of the future. I’m not sure what that’s called, but I think there’s a name for it.\n\nI don’t really write a whole lot about games. In fact, the last game I wrote about was POOLS, a liminal walking simulator based on the Backrooms, that absolutely terrifies me to my core. But, every once in a while, something interesting and different comes around. Something that isn’t just a copy and paste of Breath of the Wild with anime girls (this is actually a really cool concept, and I’m not ripping on Genshin Impact at all, honestly), or a blatant rehash of Warframe, but really, actually different.\n\nAnd, I feel like this is kind of just, that.\n\nAnime, and anime games, are enjoyed by all types and walks of life, from teenagers to the oldest heads you know. I first discovered the concept of anime in the nineties when I was just a kid, and turned on Dirty Pair for the first time.\n\nCheers to continuing the condition of being a weeb, as I grow older, and more bored with triple-a, multi-decade development games that lose my focus and interest in about half a second. I’m looking at you, the game Formerly Known as Dread Wolf.\n\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/07/11/nostr-the-strangest-and-clunkiest-twitter-replacement.html",
    "content": "Nostr, the name of a social network that I really can’t pinpoint the theme of. Like something a disgruntled Twitter developer came up with after trying Mastodon, and thought, “Hey, there aren’t enough opportunities to pay for this?” And then there’s the name, like it was definitely something thought up by a hipster sitting in a corporate lounge.\n\nBut, you might be surprised (or perplexed?) to find out that it stands for, Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays. Mastodon also uses relays, but more as a way to connect people, and to ease the struggle of the slow slog of natural federation.\n\nIf this is exactly what Nostr relays do, then … Okay!\n\nNostr, at least via Damus, has a Twitter-like environment, but also you can use it to blog, but also you can build a website and a merch store with it. All you have to do is have a … bitcoin wallet, and some money.\n\nMonths back when I originally made an account on the iOS Nostr app, Damus, I logged on and said, “Saw this app being talked about, decided to jump in and see what’s up. Hello! #introductions” and I got, honestly, a pretty warm welcome? I at least wasn’t pelted with swastikas or anything that you might assume would happen on an unfettered and seemingly unmoderated social network.\n\n\n\nAlthough, there was just one strange user who advised me that I should be anonymous, and that the goal isn’t to be famous, which kind of felt threatening, in a way? Not that I haven’t encountered some degree of angst on every social network ever created while being a “content creator.” A creator who is definitely not famous, and more just doing these things for fun, as hobbies, until one day it maybe pays bills. But that’s beside the point.\n\nI’m not sure if said person meant any of that to be threatening, but asking immediate personal questions about what I do, what my skills are, and why I should stay anonymous was … just weird.\n\nAnd then there’s this feature called “Zap” where other users can toss Satoshi coins at you for posting. That’s also a bit strange, but I guess I won’t really complain that I was given the equivalent of about 10 cents worth of Bitcoin for posting a few “hello” notes on Damus.\n\nThe potential to make real money by just posting online is, at least, intriguing. But, I’m not sure if this is really all that different from just having a Patreon in your profile links on Mastodon.\n\nNow, you’re probably thinking, “Okay, but where’s the part where you gotta have some money?” I mean, first of all, giving people money for posting (completely optional), requires that you fund a BTC wallet. Which, I don’t know how people really feel about cryptocurrency anymore in our current climate of things going on. What with AI driving the mass extinction of the human race, but I am still under the impression that operating on a crypto network is using up some kind of power fulfilled by Nvidia farms.\n\nIt is sort of a noble thought, though, from a social network: That people should and can be paid for posting, or for doing what they do, directly on the app, and quite effortlessly …\n\nBut then I returned to Nostr today to see how things are going. Partially, because I saw some random person on my Mastodon timeline somehow commenting on a fediverse post, from Nostr, and I thought, “Alright, let’s give this another look for a few minutes.”\n\n(If anyone can explain to me how someone from Nostr managed to federate into Mastodon, that’d be great.)\n\nI decided I didn’t want to just view this via the Damus app on my phone, and then went off to explore web apps. And, oh boy.\n\nAlright, so you need your public or private key from your original account. In my case, this is from Damus, and easy to find. So then you plug that into one of many apps available, all, I assume, developed by random independent developers. I searched around a bit and settled on this one called Snort. I just kind of liked how that sounded.\n\nAll’s fine and dandy, until I start reading about how your profile and/or username should be verified on-chain so that it’s less likely that someone impersonates you. So, like a blue check? In the profile settings, I have an address that was assigned to me via Damus (I think? I’m pretty sure I didn’t make it up myself), and via Snort, that address is invalid.\n\nSo, I find the page via Snort that lets you “get” or register a new one.\n\nOnce you’ve navigated there, through their not-so-obvious link, you have the option to get one for free as a subdomain, but no matter what you do, even if it says the username is fine, you get an error. Error. Error. Error.\n\nThen, the only other option is to buy one from Snort, or Iris (some kind of connected app, or network?) for the minimum price of around 30-35 dollars USD, but in BTC.\n\n\n\nThis is the part where I mentioned you’d have to have some cash. Albeit, I don’t know if this is really required. It seems to be pretty much just the Nostr equivalent of paying for a blue check on Twitter, except I can’t see why you’d want to do this on Nostr, because I, and I don’t mean any offense to people who use this network, who are genuine people just trying to connect and have fun–But I don’t know why anyone would do that on such an unknown, and niche network.\n\nSure, you can opt to support the developers, and that’s fine. But, I also see a heavy degree of AI generated content on different feeds, including from the developers at Snort.\n\n\n\nSnort also appears to default every avatar for unknown or new accounts to some variation of an AI generated person\n\nI have very strong opinions against AI generated content, and if you know me, you know I refuse to support anyone who uses this tech, at least, if I can help it.\n\nAside from the fact that this bubble is about to pop and everyone is due for a massive wake-up call, one that I’ll be bringing the popcorn for: If you can’t even make your own avatar on a social network (or, jesus christ, screenshot something from a movie or a game if you’re not feeling inspired) … I don’t think I can trust that you’re actually able to develop anything, at least ethically, you know, without contributing to the 115 degrees Fahrenheit heat and 80% humidity we’re experiencing in certain parts of the US.\n\nBut, I have these exact issues with the developer of the Ice Cubes Mastodon app, where guy has payment options for his work, and loads up the app icons with a bunch of generated slop that is most certainly ripping people off.\n\nIf you’re going to ask to be paid, even passively without requiring it, you need to get rid of the AI generated theft you’re participating in. Use some of that money to hire an artist to spend maybe a day making you a few icons.\n\nNow, the AI issue is one that is wide-spread, across every network, and I’m not sure if this is a bigger problem on Nostr, or if it’s just people peoplin’. But it is worth pointing this out, especially if we’re talking about developers developing things for monetary gain, and using theft-tech to visually represent themselves, or their products.\n\nWith all of that aside, how does *the software perform? What does it *feel like?\n\nIf you’re using the Damus app, it feels about as stable as Bluesky. Definitely in need of polish, but responsive enough that it doesn’t feel like it’s going to explode my phone. The web apps, on the other hand, are a scatter-shot. Snort works about as well as the Bluesky web app, but it glitches out, it resets your avatar to some AI garbage, and then refreshes back to what you actually have … the feed goes blank, and there are, of course, errors.\n\nThis was the better experience.\n\nIn the few other apps I tried, there was little to no functionality, or there was total functionality, with no features whatsoever.\n\nDo Nostr developers want me to be on my phone 24/7?\n\nAnd, how can we talk about how it feels to use Nostr, or Damus, or any of the web apps, without talking about the userbase.\n\nHere’s a drive-by scroll via Damus for you:\n\n\n\nMaybe I’m viewing the wrong feeds, or I’ve messed something up, but most of what I see on Nostr are people who seem to worship BTC as if it was their personal god. Like, a space where the only thing anyone’s interested in is cryptocurrency, and sometimes right-wing politics.\n\nI don’t know, that’s not really the kind of thing I tend to interact with, so it’s a bit alienating. Where are the people talking about gaming, or technology, or Linux, or even just anime or something?\n\n“Bro, I LOVE bitcoin, my ENTIRE LIFE is centered around it! What? No, I definitely have other interests. Have you heard of Ethereum? You can verify smart contracts with it.”\n\nThis is kind of the same problem Mastodon had in 2016. Very tech-worker centered, not a lot of room for normal people, with normal interests, except in this case it’s people with a crypto gambling addiction. I expressed before how much I loathed this when I was still actively participating in the NFT space.\n\nIf your community looks as though I’m being inducted into a cult centered around crypto upon entering, I’m not sure I, or anyone else, is going to feel inclined to stick around and chill. You know what I mean? Maybe the people behind Nostr can take this as some constructive criticism, or, ignore me completely.\n\nAnyway, let’s sum up what we’ve learned from this treck into the BTC social network space …\n\nThere are far too many ways to access Nostr, and usually that wouldn’t be a problem, but most of those access points are broken, or extremely lacking. Some apps attempt to nudge you into paying them for an address (or, better known as, blue check verification), and it’s entirely unclear if this is required if you intend to stick around, AND, you might end up paying people who use theft algorithms. You can get paid for posting, if you actively know how to use a Bitcoin wallet, and if you actually feel like interacting with people who talk about nothing but bitcoin. And, some way, somehow, you’re able to get Nostr to federate to the fediverse, and Mastodon, but the method of how this is accomplished is beyond me. But … at that point, maybe you should just use Mastodon?\n\nMy overall impression of Nostr, the network Jack Dorsey ran to after being evicted from Twitter, and chased off of Bluesky, is that it needs … uh, work.\n\n"

    "title": "The First Descendant: Bunnies & Guns Edition",
    "url": "/gaming/2024/07/16/the-first-descendant.html",
    "content": "Over the past week, I’ve spent a little time here and there checking out the latest game out of grindy, microtransaction game maker, Nexon. This is what I think about it.\n\nHold up, haven’t I seen this before?\n\nBack in the olden days of gaming o’ yore, there was a time when Shephards saved the galaxy, and the Inquisition had only just begun, guards of the veil be damned. Before developer studios killed their community forums and moved communication to Twitter, and while we were all playing Mafia Wars and The Sims Social on Facebook, awkwardly flirting with sims created by our close friends. An age where the latest Sims game didn’t have swimming pools, and most of us were still venturing out Into the Future.\n\nThat time was 2014. A time before gaming was corrupted by an onslaught of nonstop subscription models and battle passes. When 30 hours to beat a game was perfectly acceptable. When loading into something brand new, felt … exciting.\n\nBut war, war has changed.\n\nWarframe was released in 2013, and then later, for the Playstation 4, in 2014. This was mostly only an alpha, and all you could really do was jump down to a handful of extermination missions from a static solar system map.\n\nAround the same timeframe, the first Destiny was released on consoles, and, at the time, didn’t even remotely touch a PC.\n\nBoth games shared (and still share) similarities. As Warframe evolved, it became a mission-hub, shooter-looter game where you built your character, played with friends, and spent the rest of your time sifting through playing-card-eque warframe modifications. Destiny, and then its sequel, years later, are really not all that different.\n\nIt’s a theme I don’t feel has really caught on all that much outside of … well, Warframe and Destiny. Sure, we have Helldivers 2, but, that’s kinda sorta similar, but also not really.\n\nWarframe and Destiny 2 exist as “live service” games. Games that exist without a subscription, but do have expansions and microtransactions, and are persistent, never-ending. I think back in the golden age of gaming, we would call this a hybrid MMO.\n\nThey don’t really exist in a niche, but this genre has largely been overshadowed by MOBAs, and then survival games, and then battle royales. I think the battle royale genre still reigns supreme as one of the most popular format of games to play. Although, personally, it’s starting to feel pretty stale for me. Even if Apex Legends is really cool.\n\nBut, now we’re in 2024. Warframe has been out for about 11 years, and Destiny has been chugging along for around the same amount of time. And I guess Nexon decided to throw their own hat into the ring. For … reasons?\n\nEnter: The First Descendant. Like if Mass Effect Andromeda had a child with Destiny, and then got cybernetically modified with implants from Warframe. It’s a game occupying a concept that already exists, so much so, they purposely or accidentally copied UI design directly from Destiny 2. And, as damning as this may look, I decided to give the game a shot, regardless.\n\nHello, I am now a bunny.\n\n\n\nThe game starts out kind of unremarkable, dropping you into a sci-fi universe where an evil big guy wants an artifact for his own evil doing and bidding, and you’ve got to stop him.\n\n\n  The First Descendant is a third-person looter shooter powered by Unreal Engine 5. Become a Descendant. Fight for the survival of humanity. Descendants have unique abilities to tackle both solo and co-op missions. Up to 4 players use varied mechanics to defeat giant bosses. BE THE FIRST DESCENDANT!\n\n\nIt … kind of reminds me of the beginning of Destiny 2, paraphrased and rewritten.\n\nYou’re a descendant, and you can do really cool stuff with your hands, like shoot out ice, or electricity, and also fire guns at monsters.\n\nMy first impression, is that the gun play kind of sucks. It feels like holding a stick and going “pew pew pew” with imaginary bullets. Sure, they’re actually coming out of the gun, but there’s next to no feedback when you’re firing a gun, and when your shots are hitting your target. It just doesn’t feel like I’m shooting a weapon that kills things.\n\nNow, the graphics are pretty slick, and, well, I don’t know if this is an issue with Linux, or what, but I’m running pretty good hardware, okay? And having the settings on high, I get great FPS … until I venture into an area where there’s a lot going on, or onto a battlefield where missions are happening. Everything slows down to a 15 FPS slug-fest. And, apparently, this is something that’s happening to a lot of people, and it may not actually be a hardware issue.\n\nIt’s been quite a while since I’ve felt the struggle of a poorly optimized game.\n\nWithin the first ten levels, I wasn’t really feeling like I was having all that much fun. I was feeling like I was just shooting a gun at some aliens until loot popped out, and repeating the process over and over until I was really powerful, and also had access to the Bunny descendant.\n\nThis is about where things start to get better. I like the bunny lady.\n\nWith my descendant now fully maxed out with all the gear you can wear, and equipped with modifications (that has an interface eerily similar to Warframe), I’m starting to feel like progress is happening.\n\nI notice something though … this game takes place, entirely, on just one planet? Did I miss something? What happens when you’ve completed all the missions across the map? Is it endgame time? Do I get to go to space and see other planets?\n\nI mean, this is what I’m expecting, since this is a direct copy and paste of Destiny and Warframe. But I’ve done almost no reading on the extended story of this game, and am speaking about it now from only first-hand experience.\n\nBut what about the voice acting?\n\nThe voice-overs in TFD sound like a typical dub in an anime. Some of them are alright, some of them sound like the person speaking has no emotional capacity whatsoever. It’s a very, Nexon-ish, Eastern grinder game. Which is fine! Grinding mobs for loot is something I’ve done since 2001, when I joined Anarchy Online.\n\nMore issues, and stuff, and things.\n\nFrom the jump, to level 14, I’m only really now starting to feel like I could enjoy TFD, and that’s if they continue to fix it, and put out new content, and aren’t sued by two different developer studios.\n\nOne of the issues I encountered while randomly playing the game, thus far, is that pretty much all the content is designed with having other people around you, in mind. Except, even though there are a lot of people playing this game, sometimes there is nobody doing the mission you need help with. So, you kind of just fail, and then fail again, and then either stand there and wait for someone to waltz in, or go do another mission and return later.\n\nI’ve said it before years and years ago, and over and over again since then: A persistent online game where there is only group content, is a game I’m not that interested in.\n\nEve Online is great, until you find out you can’t do anything actually fun or remarkable unless you become a social butterfly and join massive corporations, and constantly collaborate with other people. I’m a recluse! I don’t want to do that all the time!\n\nAlbion Online is awesome … until you hit a wall and find out you’re gonna die, son. You’re gonna die and enjoy it, unless you join a guild with active players, and collab–You already know what the heck’s going on.\n\nBlack Desert Online is exactly the same, but it has more solo content than the previously mentioned games.\n\nWhat I’m trying to get at here is, even if your game is online only, built around co-op and being massively multiplayer, you still need to have content people can do by themselves, or you’re going to annoy me. You’re going to bring a screeching halt to your entire game if for some reason a ton of people just stop playing.\n\nI will give TFD a little merit, though. One of the reasons I don’t really play Warframe, is that their story and quests are ridiculously convoluted, and not very friendly to people who have day jobs. You’re telling me I have to grind for a week if I want a cool gun? Are you fuggin’ serious, dude?\n\nThe same kind of goes for Destiny. I like the theme, but I don’t like how a lot of the game kind of feels like a slog, until you get to the content you want to be in.\n\nTFD, so far, you pretty much just blast through everything like a stream of water through toilet paper.\n\nThis could be good, or bad, depending on what exactly the endgame is.\n\nAt the end of it all.\n\nWith my initial impressions down, and my extensive history of having seen this all before, and knowing exactly who Nexon is, as a company, and what they’re probably going to do (Hello, exorbitant cash shop prices), would I continue playing?\n\nProbably. I kind of do want to see what the endgame is like, and just how deep customization and stat-building goes.\n\nWould I recommend it to other people?\n\nUh … maybe? If you feel the same way I do about Warframe and Destiny? Give it a shot, maybe we’ll talk, and I’ll help you shoot some mindless aliens.\n\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/07/16/why-bluesky-will-probably-never-be-it.html",
    "content": "This is going to be a sort of long one (or maybe it won’t?), because I have a lot of thoughts as a tech and social media enthusiast, and some of those thoughts have to do with how I feel about the direction that social media is moving in. How I feel about Mastodon, and Nostr, side-by-side, and what the biggest problems with Bluesky are.\n\nSo, let’s jump right the heck in …\n\nNostr, the misconceptions, and the truth\n\nI recently wrote about Nostr, and its relayed protocol of user-owned identity that you can take … wherever. I outlined a lot of thoughts and impressions I initially had, and then what I wrote went to Reddit, and then it found itself on Nostr. It got there entirely outside my own involvement. I posted to Mastodon, and almost nowhere else.\n\nThis inspired me to log back in, and set some things up (such as domain verification from one of a few domains I own), and then I explored a bit. I interacted with people, participated in some community events that came up spontaneously, and really dug into the extreme multitude of features that run across the Nostr network.\n\nLet’s just say, I was pretty floored, and some of the impressions I had were wrong. Such as thinking that a place that is more centered around the idea of lacking censorship, or robust moderation, must be filled with toxic, horrible trolls. In the couple of days I’ve been messing with the network, I think I’ve muted like one person who said some off-the-wall shit in my notifications.\n\nBut … I think Nostr has nasty people just in the same way Twitter, Threads, and Mastodon do. They exist, and they always will, no matter where you go.\n\nSuffice to say, I learned a lot about what decentralization was, and now is. I was given an article by user @7fqx@ditto.pub that gave some really in-depth information about the emergence of decentralization–Scuttlebutt, ActivityPub, and then ATProtocol, and Nostr.\n\nI’m not going to lie, I originally started writing this as a hit piece against Bluesky, thinking their ATProtocol was just a riff of what Nostr was doing. But, apparently, both ATP and Nostr were developed independent of each other, and mostly without any knowledge of one or the other. I think that’s … actually pretty wild, and strange.\n\nOn the topic of decentralization, which is something I feel is integral to the future of the internet, I now understand Mastodon to be a place of islands, and decentralization that occurs in a way that’s more like isolated communities talking to other isolated communities. Like the latter half of The Walking Dead.\n\nIn a way, it’s decentralization, the half-measure. The full-measure, that comes with some iffy trade-offs some may not like, is Nostr, and ATProtocol.\n\nYou take your identity, your thoughts, your posts, and you move freely between pieces of software, and networks, and you lose nothing (this is nearly the direct opposite of Mastodon, where moving to a new server means burning everything you’ve ever posted, to the ground). And, honestly, I’m kind of starting to feel like that’s how it should be. The downside, is that, on Nostr, you have a public key, and a secret key. Your secret key is something you use to log in and sign events coming from your account, and your public key is basically your identity. That’s not the iffy part, though. The iffy part, is that people can use your public key to see all of your data except direct messages (which are encrypted).\n\nNot entirely too scary, unless you’re doing a lot of weird things on your account. But definitely something you should know if you decide that this is a journey you want to take, and you’re not jaded from hearing about how much Jack Dorsey loved Nostr and it’s Bitcoin affiliation (a lot of people across different platforms hold a lot of dislike for the man).\n\nAt this point, I’m less worried about the power consumption of BTC transactions, and have more shifted that focus to content farms from the likes of Microsoft and Nvidia buying up all the AI tech they can get their grubby little hands on.\n\nThat aside, I’m not writing this to blow smoke up the Bluesky developer’s butts. I, in fact, am not favorable of Bluesky and there are some specific reasons for that. Maybe this spells their downfall, or maybe they’ll be a tight-knit community that doesn’t really expand all that much, forever.\n\nBluesky, the Apple of social media\n\nBluesky is a place that a couple million people call home (I think, last I saw, it was around 6 million or so). There’s no algorithm, and much like Nostr, you own your identity. Except, for now, that’s mostly tied to the website’s central server.\n\nNow, obviously, there are far less people populating Nostr, but Nostr and its relays are able, and are connected to both ActivityPub and Bluesky (just, not through ATProtocol).\n\nMost of what you’ll see on bsky.app are quite a few furries, an actually impressive population of Second Life users, and quite a lot of LGBTQ+ people. None of these things or communities are inherently bad. In fact, I think they’re probably the only reason Bluesky is really alive at all, today.\n\nMy angst and negative feelings about the direction of Bluesky have nothing to do with the LGBTQ+ community, or any other community residing on the platform.\n\nThe issues I mainly hold have to do with how far up their own asses the board and developers are, in regard to the platform, and its development over the past year or so. This is why I kind of think of them as the Apple of social media. And you might think, “Hey, don’t you own like a billion pieces of Apple tech?”\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nBut this is more like if Apple skipped over having Steve Jobs and just went straight to some random guy who didn’t know what he was doing. You know, like putting up a wall and locking out all potential users for a year, and keeping all new sign-ups under lock and key via exclusive codes. As you might imagine, having that walled-garden erected through six or seven different events where people were leaving Twitter in droves, very likely probably worked against the social network’s best interest.\n\nMainly, because Threads came out of absolutely nowhere, and sucked up most of those users.\n\nThat’s only half of the issue, though. The other part to all of this, is that the developers I see directly on Bluesky do not recognize or acknowledge this at all. Paul Frazee, whose influence goes back quite a bit further than Bluesky, posts as though it’s the greatest platform ever made (maybe just because he’s a developer for Bluesky). But the website, despite its six million some-odd users, feels almost completely dead.\n\nWhich is ridiculous, because, as I’ve said, Nostr has far less users than that, and it most definitely doesn’t feel dead when you post.\n\nNot to mention, we’re over a year into Bluesky, and it still, more or less, is propped up to look, feel, and act just like Twitter did in 2014. ATProtocol, in this respect, still feels mostly like an afterthought that’s inaccessible to most users.\n\nMeanwhile, if you really like Nostr, you can get going with your own chunk of the network immediately, with about a page of install commands.\n\nIt’s this mixture of grandiosity that emanates from Bluesky, and the blunder of keeping their doors closed through one exodus after another, that I think they’ve shot themselves in the feet so much that they now don’t have feet. They have stumps.\n\nBut, if you’ve followed me all the way through this article, I think there’s a way they can blow the doors open. But, then they’d have to sort of abandon their idea of the ATProtocol, and stop trying to be the center of social media they most definitely are not, and probably never will be. And, really, that’s the final issue I have with Bluesky and the ATProtocol.\n\nIt feels like they’re trying to do Nostr, but be corporate-owned. Bluesky doesn’t feel like it’s owned by the people, developed by the people, and run by the people. It feels like it’s run by some suits, who give the impression that the people will have their freedom, as long as they say it’s okay.\n\nAnd that, my buddy ol’ pal, just ain’t okay.\n\nThe elephant and the ostrich\n\nWhich brings us squarely back to Mastodon, and Nostr. Both platforms have their own merits. Nostr is about controlling your own content, and what you see, and largely eschews censorship to a high degree. But everyone can see almost everything you do and are talking about, whenever they want. Mastodon, on the other hand, puts the tools into a user’s hands to create a network, and build their own communities, while picking and choosing who those communities interact with. A network that … encourages users to police everyone around them … which is how we end up with tyrannical admins acting like they work in a prison, and they’ve just been promoted to Warden.\n\nIf only there were some way to take the best parts of both of these animals, and make them one.\n\nAn elephrich.\n\nFor now, though, I am at least pretty content to screw around with both while I feel around and see what sticks. In the age of corporate control and censorship so heavy that people can’t even say “kill” or “suicide” any more (these are only two of the most egregious examples I can think of), I think it’s healthy to explore your options, and cement your identity, and who you are online, before everything else we’ve come to know is lost completely.\n\nIf that’s something you care about, at least.\n"

    "url": "/gaming/2024/07/19/wuthering-waves-genshin-impact-but-for-adults.html",
    "content": "Wuthering Waves is another mobile game that crosses the boundaries between your phone, your console, and your PC. Much like the games that came before it via MiHoYo, it proves that a gacha can be so much more than a slot machine rewarding you with anime girls. For years and years, I would’ve never considered a phone a thing with actual good games, and I’m slowly but surely being proven wrong.\n\nRecently, I wrote about MiHoYo’s latest game, Zenless Zone Zero, a cyberpunk slice and shoot ‘em up that absolutely rips ass. But now, I want to talk about the apocalyptic world of Wuthering Waves, where while wandering some desolate canyon, I came face-to-face with this dude on a huge motorcycle from hell that sliced me in half and killed me (okay, not really, but the dude on the bike was definitely there).\n\nFirst of all, the soundtrack:\n\n\n\nThis is the music you hear as you’re logging on, introduced to the game with something that sounds like it should’ve been in Metal Gear Solid: Guns of the Patriots. I’m not even sharting you. I think Kuro knew they had fierce competition that’s already years down the development line, and they knew they had to immediately capture you with something.\n\nSo, they chose violins and a piano.\n\nAnd then there’s the setting …\n\nThe story is about this apocalyptic event called the Lament that wiped out most of humanity, which also caused a whole bunch of monsters to plague the world. You’re a person woken from your dreams in search of your lost memories, and ultimately, the goal of beating the “Lament.” I think that’s about as simple as it can get–A plot you’d expect from maybe Ghost in the Shell, but with swords.\n\nI’m sure there’s an anime more suited to compare that to, but my mind is full of fog and hangover pain.\n\nIt is, at face value, quite a bit darker, and a little more adult than the bright and cheery high-fantasy world of Genshin Impact.\n\nI’ve also done a little bit of reading, and some say the story in its current state is very short, but I think that’s the way these things go as live service, gacha games that never truly end (plus, Waves just launched). And, as another Breath of the Wild clone, there is surely much more to do than story content.\n\nFor example, Somnoire, these supernatural realms of lost dreams that you traverse in a challenge to collect “cards” that power you up in order to ultimately win a reward. In a way, this sort of reminds me of the elemental challenges in Genshin Impact. And, of course, there are tons and tons of world quests that I’ve yet to explore.\n\n\n\nMostly, though, this write-up is about my initial and beginning impressions in the game.\n\nSpeaking of just having started, my main player character is level 40.\n\n\n\nEither I’m totally kicking tons of ass, or this game is more forgiving than Genshin, where I’ve been meddling in the quests since it launched, and I think my current cast of characters are level 30?\n\nDespite how much I like Genshin, my main issue with it, is that traveling on-foot is slow. And your stamina … is low.\n\nIn Waves, not so much. You can grapple onto hooking points and swing across short distances, and then float around on a glider sorta deal. But, wait, there’s more! You can surely climb up the edge of a cliff, but if you hold down the run key, you can also RUN UP THE SIDE OF A CLIFF.\n\n\n\nIt seems like this game was specifically engineered with exasperated Genshin players in mind. I’m sure a lot of people who play it know, MiHoYo is … let’s just say, not so forgiving. From running around, to pulling for new characters, it takes time. A lot of time. Unless you’re extremely lucky, or, spending tons of money (which I refuse to do, I will never spend hundreds in one sitting on a gacha game).\n\nIn fact, I jumped back into Genshin after playing Waves for a little bit, and I was taken aback a bit by the fact that your sprint only lasts a very short time, compared to Waves where, in many areas, it’s infinite. Imagine that, an open world Breath of the Wild clone that says, “Hey, this is a game where you potentially pay us money for fictional characters, but also, we’ll try not to waste your time.”\n\nBut don’t take any of that to sound like I hate Genshin. No, I really enjoy it. It’s just that, through spending time with Waves, I’ve found there are definitely things that could be improved upon. Things that would really only just be a quality of life sort of fix for Genshin. Not that I’m … that invested in these games. I haven’t been really invested in a game since Mass Effect 3 ended.\n\nEverything since then has just been a search for the next greatest thing. Baldur’s Gate 3 had that feeling for a while, and then the developers dropped it, decided there would be no DLC or expanded content, and peaced out. And here we have the reason why I’m more tending to play endless open world gacha games than 70 dollar Steam games that end and cease updates and expanded content. The sort of thing that leaves you feeling like the time your girlfriend ghosted you after months of being together with no hint that anything was ever wrong.\n\nOkay, maybe it’s not that serious.\n\nAll that aside, I haven’t really touched on the opening experience in Wuthering Waves.\n\nWhen you first log in, much like Genshin, you’re dropped into this world that, from just camming around, you can see is very large. You’re set off on a starting quest, and before you know it, you’ve seen two cities, a few towns, and fought off the engineer of these weird puppet people. A story quest that feels literally like something out of a show on Crunchyroll (not a sponsored comment).\n\nAnd, did I mention the combat has almost the exact same dodge mechanics employed in Zenless Zone Zero? I’m not entirely sure how both games managed to have this real clinched, click, dodge, attack sorta mechanic (since they both came out at almost the exact same time), but I enjoy it! Another thing that felt weird going back into Genshin where the dodge amounts to … just dashing out-of-the-way real fast and sometimes failing to do so.\n\nThe only thing that leaves a little to be desired, is the English voice acting. But … that’s kind of an issue in a lot of these games, and I wouldn’t say it really takes away from the experience.\n\nHaving rambled on enough about this, for now, I think I’d give this game a 7 out of 10 anime girls for the price of 19.99 and a little bit of luck. And I’m cautiously, but optimistically, anticipating new content.\n"

    "title": "Mastodon: Become Immortal, the Logical Next Step in Federated Social Media",
    "url": "/social media/2024/07/21/mastodon-immortal.html",
    "content": "\n\nMastodon is obviously an already established and semi-well known social network–A user-owned network of communities. But one of the biggest issues I always see the corporate social media denizens talk about, is that the loss of content when moving instances (sometimes, you have to do this) is one of the biggest turn-offs. And that’s definitely something I can attest to. If I were still on mastodon.social, from my humble posting-beginnings in 2017, I’d have a post history longer than five football fields and probably plenty to cringe at.\n\nThe question remains: Why haven’t we been able to take this history with us … if every instance you’ve ever been federated with is keeping that data.\n\nWhat do I mean by this?\n\nEvery single time you post on Mastodon, your words get pushed out to other instances (servers), and in order for people to be able to read what you said, a copy of it is downloaded onto that server. It does this very quickly, so quick that it seems as though it happens in real-time. And, for all intents and purposes, I’m not inclined to believe that it doesn’t.\n\nIf you’ve ever had an account on an instance that isn’t mastodon.social, and you have a posting history, and you remember your username: Go over to mastodon.social, create a burner account, and then search up that username.\n\nYeah, you see that? Your entire body of posting-work is still there, even if you deleted your account, even if the instance you were on is long dead.\n\nThis is obviously not true for every server. Some choose to delete old content to make space for the new, but there are many Mastodon servers out there retaining everything ever posted, like mastodon.social.\n\nBut what point am I trying to get at here? As far as you’re probably concerned, even if that data still exists, and your account, and instance does not, you can’t access it, right? You can’t reclaim everything you’ve said and done, and put it back where it belongs: Under your ownership.\n\nOr, what if you could?\n\nIf you’ve been following my posting history on here in the past week, I’ve been screwing around with Nostr, and musing about Bluesky. Two networks using a similar protocol, that I feel are getting the idea of what I’m thinking of here, only about 75% correct.\n\nBluesky’s problem, is that the protocol is owned by … the owners. The corporation. Your keys report to their server, and in return, so does your content. A central server that has a lot of different keyholes.\n\nNot really the optimal experience, because you can’t create your own server, and build your own community, and survive if the main Bluesky datacenter goes out, right? The only thing you can do is host your own software that essentially just holds keys and content, and, as far as I know, all of that will be worthless if the devs ever go offline with the main server.\n\nSo then there’s Nostr, where all of your data lives everywhere on the network, and as long as you have your keys, you can use any app that utilizes the protocol, and continually access everything you post, forever. You can’t be banned, but you also can’t block anyone. And any random stranger can take your public key from your profile, and view your entire everything (as I’ve said before).\n\nI would say this is also not really that optimal. The idea is great, but the execution trades privacy for extreme versatility.\n\nThis brings us back to Mastodon, which is still in active development, still receiving new features, and … well, kind of also only has the whole thing about 75% correct.\n\nThere’s that last little bit we’re missing here.\n\nThe user should have the option of a community, a personal community away from what’s viewed to be the central Mastodon server and have their privacy, but, they should also be able to retain their posts, and their bookmarks, and their likes, and their lists, and everything else.\n\nHow do we accomplish this?\n\nKeys.\n\nThe entire fediverse (for the most part) already has all of your content. So, if every user had a key tying them to that content, no matter where you’re located, be it mastodon.social, or mkultra.monster, then you could just go wherever you want? That’s the idea, at least.\n\nYour content becomes immortal, immutable, and that’s the one missing puzzle piece to ActivityPub. I am 100% sure of this, and I don’t know what the developer stance is on the topic of keys and immutable data, but I fully believe this is something that should be on their roadmap. Yes, storage space is a concern … but holding onto the text content of a post is much easier, and smaller in size, than holding onto larger pieces of data (like photos, and videos). If you scrolled back to five years ago and found something you posted, but the only thing you could see was the text, would you be all that disappointed?\n\nI guess that part is subjective.\n\nMastodon is already setup nearly identical to Nostr, except users live on the relays. So just … add user generated keys to the mix, and I am 100% double-dippin’ certain that most of the naysayers being spammed by engagement farming on Threads and Twitter will jump ship.\n\nMark my worms.\n\nIf it isn’t. Well. They’re making a huge mistake.\n"

    "content": "For about four or five months, I’ve been using Wordpress to push out all my larger thoughts, ideas, and musings. I have to admit, Wordpress is pretty simple, and very convenient. It requires a whole lot of just … typing what you want, and then slapping post, and nothing else! Unfortunately, after some careful consideration, I decided that I kind of missed hacking into code. So, I moved some repos around, switched branches, and launched a new version of my website via Github in Ruby, i.e., Jekyll.\n\nThis is the hacker experience.\n\nThis does mean I have to move all the posts over that I want to keep, but that’s not really a whole lot of trouble, since I have it all backed up, easy peasy.\n\nOne of the main reasons I’m also doing this though, is that hosting my own website on a VPS is also costly. It’s money I don’t need to be spending, when I can throw something down onto Github, and continually update it as I see fit, and then share links. It kind of seems like a no-brainer. And, if for some reason I lose my ability to pay for things, my website goes nowhere. It’s still here.\n\nThe other reason I’m doing this is because, like I mentioned in the first paragraph, I miss writing code, and doing things over the command line for my website. Not only that, but actually customizing Wordpress is a gigantic pain in the ass, and I can’t entirely do everything that I want to do. You might think a static blog running on Ruby wouldn’t be so versatile, but it is! If you’re viewing this post right now, everything probably looks really basic. But that’ll change. I have limited time outside of work, so the most important thing is just getting everything running. Then, comes the rest.\n\nThe posting process is a little more involved, though, just the way I like it. I create drafts on the command line, and then edit them in VS Code. Once finished, I publish over the command line, and then push to Git so that Jekyll can rebuild with the new content I’ve created.\n\nHurrah! I’m a content creator!\n\n\n\nNow, the process of moving everything over manually is something I’ve decided to do, not because Wordpress wasn’t able to export. Oh no, I got my posts exported from Wordpress. But the formatting it generates for Jekyll is completely wrong, and entirely fuggled up. So I’m just going to gradually dig through what I’ve posted over there, edit it, and then put them up here and make it look as though it was always here.\n\nEasy, peasy.\n\nBut, ay, that’s really all I wanted to post about for now.

Or, to be more specific, the deprecated paginator plugin for Github’s Jekyll. I think I must’ve gone through about forty different arrangements of code, and also deletion of code, and edited code, and re-edited code, and then complete deletion. I was pulling out my hair, I was crying and shidding into my pillow … I was swearing and cursing up and down in commit comments and in a help request on the official Jekyll repo.\n\nLuckily, someone I know via Mastodon, user @TheIdOfAlan@hachyderm.io, jumped in and wrote some revised code in a pull request via the repo for this website. And … he completely fixed it. This website now has proper pagination. No infinite scrolling that obscures the footer! And I didn’t even have to change the theme. A really huge thanks to Alan, once again!\n\n\n\nYou’ll also notice that every single post has a comment section! This is due-in-part to the utterances plugin that utilizes Github itself for conversations, as if you’re replying to an issue in a repo. Except the “issue” is my post, and you can say whatever you want. I also need to impliment a search feature, and possibly a light and dark mode switch toggle. But, that’s for the future, because I’ve had quite enough of grueling code-stabbing for … uh, this week, at least.\n\nNext up comes one of the easiest and also more fun parts of web development! CSS customization! I’m an absolute noob when it comes to using Ruby, even though I definitely have some experience with it thanks to early builds of Mastodon. But HTML and CSS are my game, I’ve been doing this since 1999 (or maybe even earlier than that, thanks to Geocities).\n\nMy offline job has been keeping me busy and running me ragged, so that’s really all I have the energy to write for now.

If you look to the top right, whether you’re on mobile or desktop, you’ll notice the navigation bar has become a constant hamburger menu. This is the way it should be, as I have many, many links.

I dunno, brother.\n\nBut this is the nature of web development. Getting everything in-place where I want it, and how I want it, and then improving, and changing, and updating from there.\n\nSpeaking of! In that little hamburger menu, you’ll notice a link called “log,” where you can read about changes I’ve made on a particular date, starting with today.

This is not a needed note to the changelogs.\n\nI’ve also added a page describing my thoughts and feelings on the farce of “AI,” and the “why” as to why you should have a website, especially in this day and age of destructive corporate social media and possible ridiculous admins on random fediverse instances (something I am unfortunately very familiar with). And then I finished it off with a flavor-page depicting the default apps I like to use for different things within the technology that I employ in my day-to-day life.\n\nBut that’s what this website is about … Me!\n\nI was a little wary yesterday, thinking, “Oh man, oh geez, I just deleted my Wordpress site, and jumped to this with no plan whatsoever, like some kind of impulsive teenager.” But it’s working out! I’ve already put up probably more content than I ever would have on a restrictive Wordpress setup, and, with how the company itself is going all-in on this AI bubble, I’m sorta glad to remove myself from their influence, entirely.\n\nI’ve also, finally put out some sort of update on my Patreon, in regard to this website, and what I’ve been doing. I try to remember and make space/time to do this, because it is, after-all, a place where people support what I do. I’ve had the thing, I think, since 2013. Which, come to think of it, reminds me that I should plug that here. I do all sorts of things, from music, to video, to streaming, to web development, and hey, I even run a Mastodon instance! Head over to my Patreon, sign up, and you’ll even get access to a Discord where I talk sometimes.\n\nBut, anyway, thanks for reading!\n\n\n"

Do you go outside and roll around in the grass, praying you don’t accidentally slob around in some poopoo? Well, that’s not what I do. Today, I sat down in front of my computer screen, chugged an energy drink as my heart screamed at me “Please, for the love of pizza and beer, stop the caffeine!” and I said, “What if I filled out every single link in the nav section?”\n\nAnd that’s what I did, good ol’ pal, o’ whoever the heck you are.\n\nIt started with simple things, such as adding my “daily carry” page that shows off the random crap I hold on my person when I’m out and about. Funny story about that bag in the photo, I got that off of thinkgeek back in 2011, before they were shutdown and … seemingly replaced with a forward to the near-defunct Gamestop. That wasn’t what I expected to find, and this sucks immeasurably.\n\nAfterward, I added a “today I learned” section, for random things I learn on a daily basis, a “share” link for people to share my website more easily to ActivityPub enabled servers, a pod and blogroll, for blogs I read, and podcasts I listen to (which I recommend you check out!), and other small things, like the “someday” page where I talk about things I’d like to do someday (like, own a house!).\n\nBigger additions you might find will be the [REVOSA] page where I semi-detail the story behind my Second Life store. The discography page, where I list every single musical release I’ve ever made, and provide links to the Patreon member download for each of them. The books I’ve published through Smashwords (now owned by Draft2Digital), and then a “why” section, detailing why I think you and everyone else should have a personal website (you know, instead of just posting everything you’ve ever done on fickle social media websites).\n\nIn the “other” section, you’ll find my former NFT project, haxPunks (something I do for fun every once in a while, now), the resurrection of my “how to second life” guide, my Dungeons and Dragons characters, fanfiction I’ve started and never finished, and a little “scrap” page of my favorite characters in games I’ve played throughout the years.\n\nAll-in-all, I’ve turned Nova Prime into an actual webpage, that far expands beyond what I had on Wordpress, and brings back some of what was lost when I stopped updating the original version of Nova Prime.\n\nA screenshot of the website that was on this domain before I spent six months on Wordpress.\n\n\n\nAfter setting up, and then completing the initial build of the entire site, I actually find myself struggling to think of a reason as to why I ever switched to self-hosting Wordpress. Jekyll is completely fine for writing posts, and it makes you feel like a hacker. Because you have to write everything either in a console, or via a text editor (I use VS Code).\n\nNow … if I could figure out a way to give the website some kind of “follow” button, outside of providing a link to the auto-generated feed XML at the bottom of the main page.\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/07/28/the-fediverse.html",
    "content": "\n\nBack on Wordpress, before I hit the nuke button, and was subsequently apparently locked out of my Digital Ocean account … just because my Github e-mail changed, I had a page dedicated to explaining the fediverse, and showing off the different ways you could interact with ActivityPub. I have put this page back via Nova Prime, but I wanted to use this post today to talk about some of the new user issues I witness as someone who posts regularly and almost entirely primarily, on Mastodon.\n\nMaybe you’re on Threads, already interacting with the fediverse, and to that I say, kudos! I have some issues with Threads, and its over-the-top algorithm, along with Meta’s wholesale endorsement of the AI grift … but hey, anything is better than nothing. And I say this, because, a user-owned internet and social web is 100% the way of the future. A lot of people have realized that corporations with profit interests are really bad at running social places for people to connect with each other, and I have no doubt the number of people realizing this will continue to grow.\n\nMaybe you’re on Bluesky, and maybe you’re bridged to the fediverse. Maybe you’re not. I have other issues with Bluesky, in that, they’re basically doing a Nostr, but centralized, wherein all keys report to their central server (which is very much not the decentralization they like to say ATProtocol is). Add on top of that, I just find some of the developers behind the platform really arrogant and full of themselves, and I don’t know man, that just annoys me, kinda. Bluesky is at least, an option, not really a great one, because it’s still a corporation, with corporate interests, controlling your digital social life. But, it’s whatever. Some people are comfortable with their Twitter 2.0, and that’s fine.\n\nBut the issue is, people from Twitter, people from Threads, people from Bluesky: They’ll jump onto a random Mastodon instance, and probably about 70% of the time, experience some kind of major grievance against themselves, or people they support (through slurs, hate, bigotry, etc.), and then they’ll swear off the whole entire shabang because of this, and return from whence they came. And, I thought maybe this was a failing of the user simply treating Mastodon and other fediverse software like Twitter. Wherein they’re like, “Hey, I’ll just make an account and I’m done!”\n\nIt is, unfortunately for some, not as simple as that.\n\nI realized, though, this isn’t really the fault of the user. Every other app is setup to be quick, simple, and easy. But Mastodon requires, and I really mean it, requires that you investigate the server you’re looking into joining. It’s like we’re back in the 90s, and your avenue for social interaction online is internet forums, and you definitely don’t want to join a forum full of people with interests you don’t enjoy.\n\nIf you want to give the fediverse a shot, and you want to be rid of corporate interests, take some of these pointers in mind:\n\n\n  Don’t just throw a dart at the wall and join a random Mastodon instance.\n  Do take the time to check and see if the community you’re joining has rules, guidelines, and (unless they’ve made it private) a block list.\n  If a server’s block list is public, look at what types of instances they’re blocking, and the why.\n  And yes, these are communities you’re joining.\n\n\nMastodon is decentralized in a way that it is many little Twitters, connected to each other through different methods, different systems, and a lot of the time, entirely different budgets.\n\n\n  Take the time to look at the live feed of the instance you’re considering, see what kinds of people are posting.\n    \n      Are there nazis? Don’t join.\n      Are there weirdos sharing illegal content? Don’t join.\n      Are there normal seeming people, but the instance/server has no clear rules or guidelines against hate and bigotry? Don’t join.\n    \n  \n\n\nAt the end of the day, the fediverse is a lot like any other social place on the internet. There are bad people, there are gross people. These people can and will try to interact with you if you allow them. But if you follow the above steps, the chances of this happening become ever the lower. Yes, you will run into jerks, even on a good server/instance. I highly recommend utilizing the block and report feature as often as possible, because there are actual people behind moderation decisions, and they are reading your reports.\n\nWith all of that in mind, are you ready to give it a shot? Normally I would link to the official “join Mastodon” page, but I recently realized that they’re filtering out much of the fediverse, just because some servers don’t meet their standards of having daily backups, or three moderators at a time (which is entirely not necessary if you’re running a community of 20 people). Check out this page, instead. Instances.social lists every single instance, so that you have a fair shake at seeing everything that’s available … at least, on the Mastodon side of things (I would recommend Mastodon as a starting point before you get involved in something like Misskey or Pleroma).\n\nThat’s it, and, of course, you can definitely contact me at my own instance if you have further questions and/or would like anything else explained to you in depth.\n"

But I got out, I drove, I arrived, I shoved food into my gullet, and then I sat down to reformat the front matter of over one hundred different old posts from my numerous blogs I’ve had over the years (some of which were abandoned to time for a very long … time).\n\nA lot of this required editing some of the front matter so that it actually displays properly on Jekyll, which, I entirely blame Wordpress for. The Jekyll export plugin available over there does the job, uhm, sort of? Like, you get your posts out, and it has front matter for Jekyll … but it’s all wrong, and will spit all kinds of errors at you if you use any kind of punctuation in your post titles.\n\nBut anyway, you can see now, that my blog is currently consisting of around 57 pages to sift through, which makes the search function up in the nav section really useful!\n\nA lot of posts date all the way back to 2015 when my store in Second Life was brand new, and I was posting almost daily about new products I was releasing. And then, as time marches forward, I have a handful of posts about some fiction I was writing. In some of these posts, including more recent ones, images may be broken, or absent entirely. This is something I … tentatively want to fix, at least, for the more recent posts. But, I may not be able to, or might just decide I don’t have the energy for it.\n\nThe import and reformat of all of these posts was mostly done as a more historical data keeping sort of thing. I don’t want to lose everything I’ve ever written anymore. Speaking of, I wrote some comprehensive guides on beginning in Second Life over a year ago, and they were thought to be completely lost. Until I realized that Archive.org had literally all of it, backed up, free of charge. So, that’s back.\n\nAll-in-all, this website went from being completely bare-bones, to having most of everything I’ve done, ever, since 2015. And that’s, a lot.\n\nThat I have no issues uploading and storing all of that here on Github is pretty amazing … Despite Github’s takeover by Microsoft, and Microsoft’s constant blunders with AI and installing spyware on your PC.\n\nI do wonder, though, what happens if for some reason I need more storage space. I’ve never really explored that avenue, and I don’t even know if you can pay for more space or not. But, you know, mountains and molehills, issues that we’ll resolve if ever they need to be crossed off the list. For now, this is quite fine.\n\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/07/30/threads-project-2025.html",
    "content": "\n\nI’ve written here and there about Threads. I’ve written about how I believe it’s a totally viable platform for federated social media users to dip their toes into the ocean of what it means to not be locked to just one platform. I’ve written about Threads suddenly posting some smarmy Harry Potter reference post, regardless of what this means for the transgender users of the platform, and the hate that’s routinely spewed from the author of the series.\n\nAnd now, today, it is with great displeasure, I have to write about Dustin Carmack, director of public policy behind Meta, and by extension, Threads, and his association with Project 2025. No, I’m not talking about the totally cool and awesome dude who made Doom, John Carmack\n\n\n\nIf you didn’t know, Project 2025 is a crackpot fascist group of schemers who seek to seize control of the country, and then subsequently drag us back to 1952.\n\n\n  As The New Republic notes, Project 2025 is “a remarkably detailed guide to turning the United States into a fascist’s paradise.” The primary document of Project 2025, the magazine explains, lays out what is essentially a “Christian nationalist vision of the United States, one in which married heterosexuality is the only valid form of sexual expression and identity; all pregnancies would be carried to term, even if that requires coercion or death; and transgender and gender-nonconforming people do not exist.”\n\n\nThis brings us to Dustin, the man who wrote the section of these guidelines on the intelligence community.\n\nThe basis of this chapter is mostly establishing who the enemies of the United States are, be it Europe, China, or North Korea, then stiffening security, and heightening penalties. It’s an aggressive push for revenge against these key countries, and, I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m not interested in World War 3.\n\nThat all aside, this is one small part of a larger agenda that is designed to swing us back to the fifties, and strip most people of their fundamental, inalienable rights. To erase those who are different, who experience their lives different than that of what they view to be the “average American.” And I believe this has already started, as Elon Musk seized control of Twitter on October 28th, 2022, and now Meta with their new public policy director, Dustin Carmack.\n\nThis could be even worse than Musk’s seizure of Twitter, because Meta doesn’t just own Threads. Meta owns Facebook (already a hot-bed of misinformation and rage-baiting), Whatsapp, and Instagram, too.\n\nI believe this is a concerted effort to control not just what you share on corporate social media, but how you exist, online. An effort to swing public opinion, and manipulate it, any way they want, using the greatest forces of information in the 21st century: Social media.\n\nDustin has worked for the Ron DeSantis presidential campaign, the Heritage Foundation, and the office of the Director of National Intelligence. To hire someone like this to lead public policy on your budding platform, among others that have existed for years, spells … something terrible.\n\nI remember it like it was just yesterday, when Adam Mosseri called Threads a place that was to be “friendly, and open.”\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Adam Mosseri (@mosseri)\n\n\nHow far we’ve fallen from our vision in only a year, after establishing a platform that was thought to be a viable alternative for regular people to gather away from the engagement-bait hell that Twitter has become.\n\nNow is the best time for you to explore real alternatives, if even you’re still interested in maintaining a presence on social media. Read my post on getting started on Mastodon, and my informational piece on the ActivityPub network, and give leaving corporate social media some real thought. Your digital identity, and maybe even your safety, in the future, might depend on it.\n\nSome other things Project 2025 seeks to do:\n\n\n  Gut climate change protections\n  Crack down on legal immigration\n  Restrict reproductive care, even further\n  Gut the education department (it’s harder to control people when they’re educated)\n  End subsidies on stem cell research\n  Continue and finish construction on the border wall\n  Eliminate the LGBTQ+ community from mention in all forms of education\n  Turn the FBI into an enforcement-arm of the White House, rather than an independent agency\n  Rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination\n  Take the corporate income tax down to 18%\n  End prescription drug price caps\n  Force remote-workers to work 10 hour, rather than 8 hour days\n  Roll back overtime protections in the workplace\n  End the Student loan forgiveness program\n  Gut medicaid\n  Increase taxes on middle-class families, at the very least (because we all know there is more than just a middle-class)\n\n\nAnd this is all of what I could glean from viewing numerous websites who all seem to only list a few of the facts, rather than all of them. But I’m sure there’s more …\n\nYou had an okay run Threads, but it seems your time is up.\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/07/31/bluesky-part-3-all-your-data-are-belong-to-us.html",
    "content": "\n\nIt feels like I just got done writing about how Bluesky will probably never be it (when I was a lot more enamored with Nostr than I currently am), and then some news dropped a few days ago that initially went under my radar, but is apparently a little bit bigger than it originally seemed. Remember how I keep talking about corporations and social media, and how corporations don’t know how to run social platforms? Yeah, well, that holds true today. And this time, it’s, unsurprisingly, in regards to Bluesky. It’s not as serious as Meta hiring an actual, literal fascist to oversee their public policies, but it still sucks.\n\nGranted, I kind of abandoned using Bluesky as a main platform a long time ago. Back when you still needed an access pass to get in, and everyone treated it like it was some kind of exclusive club consisting of some of the worst people you never wanted to know when you were still on Twitter. And then Twitter had a mass exodus, and they didn’t open the doors, and then Twitter had another mass exodus, and they didn’t open the doors, and then Twitter had yet another mass exodus, and while they refused to open the doors to the public, Threads took in over one hundred million people.\n\nI bet they’re cursing themselves double-hard, as they pretend that holding an access key that reports back to their own servers is somehow decentralization, or that by using Bluesky, users are in control of their own data (even though I have never seen a single iota of evidence that would make this true). In fact, it seems like the developers behind Bluesky might just have ulterior motives when it comes to data, or, let’s just be Frank here, your data.\n\nOkay, okay, I’ve riffed on these points enough, and you don’t need to call me Frank.\n\nA day ago, the official Bluesky account announced that they were partnering with some company I’ve never heard of, Buffer.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that Bluesky has partnered with Buffer, a social media toolkit with scheduling and cross-posting features, to make posting to Bluesky even easier!\n\nLearn how to connect your Bluesky account and schedule your posts on Buffer here: buffer.com/bluesky[image or embed]— Bluesky (@bsky.app) Jul 30, 2024 at 11:00 AM\n\n\nOn the surface, it looks like some brand-oriented social media tool to make Bluesky look more attractive to influencers and corporate accounts. Which … is in and of itself kinda, meh. Like, why do you want those types infesting your platform? Have you seen Threads?\n\nBut it goes a bit deeper than that.\n\nYou know that company that’s been scraping the whole entire internet and stealing all of our content without asking for permission, and then going on talk shows and media talking about how it’s totally cool and they don’t care. They’ll do what they want.\n\nYou know them, they’re uh …\n\nOpenAI.\n\nBuffer is associated with OpenAI.\n\n\n\nFrom their own website:\n\n\n  The Buffer AI Assistant uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze trends and patterns in social media data, and generates ideas based on that information. Buffer’s AI Assistant is based on OpenAI’s proprietary API\n\n\nSo, let me get this totally straight. The Bluesky devs thought it would be a great idea to partner up with a company that, obviously, needs access to all of a user’s data in order to function in the way that it does. And, with use of Buffer’s AI assistant, that “analyzes trends and patterns in social media data” (I love how this is worded ambiguously so it’s completely unclear what social media data they’re talking about, and how it’s acquired), you can … uhm, create unique posts? That, what? Draw in more clicks? Sound like frikken’ garbage? Make you look like an inauthentic tool-bag?\n\nAnd all of this is based on OpenAI’s tech? You know, that thing that continues to rip literally everyone off? Stealing and rebranding and twisting your words, your art, your music, while the board of directors sit around with shit-eating grins on their faces, every single time someone invites them to put a face to their names?\n\nBluesky: Decentralization, but not really. And also, user ownership of data, but not really. Uh, we own it, and now also so does OpenAI.\n\nNot only are corporations bad for social media, but even when presented with a friendly face, giving off vibes of open platforms, and open source tech, you still cannot trust them. Do not trust a corporate-minded bunch of fools to facilitate a place for you to connect with others, and expect them to not quietly undermine your privacy and right to not have your data stolen and used for profit.\n\nAnd I’ll say it for the hundredth time: You should have your own website. You should find a decent Mastodon server. You should get off of corporate social media, or at least create a silo for yourself in the aforementioned places, just in case. If you do anything worth saving, worth backing up, worth keeping, you definitely shouldn’t only have it on these platforms that are eating your data, and using new age fascists to write policies (see: Threads & Project 2025).\n\nI think I’ve said most of my piece here, but man, I cannot wait until the next reveal. When they come out of the woodwork with some friendly sounding post where they admit to all of their users that they’ve been training AI on everything you’ve ever posted (this isn’t yet known to be true, but admit it, you know they probably are).\n\n"

Maybe you also have some kind of cloud service where you store all of your photos and important files, just in case. Maybe you also subscribe to an online news feed, such as Apple News. Perhaps you just subscribe to the one big Apple service that bundles all of this together? Whatever you do, you probably have at least 3-4 subscriptions running, per month, at minimum.\n\nBut, don’t forget, you also have bills to pay. Car payments, insurance for your car, rent, or a mortgage, home owners insurance (if you own a home), credit card payments, phone service payments (because just about everyone has a phone), utilities, taxes, and so on and so forth. We may as well consider these things subscriptions, too. Subscriptions for some things we don’t enjoy having to pay for, but we just kind of … do.\n\nAh, what life would be if you could just have a roof over your head and food in your stomach, for your whole entire life, as if being alive entitled you to the right to just kinda not die!\n\n\n\nOh! That’s right! You gotta buy food, and gas for your car, and you have to buy these things, frequently.\n\nBut you’re lonely, and you aren’t seeing anyone. Well, do I have news for you. There’s an app for that! Go on, download one! Now swipe. Okay, now swipe again. Oh, you liked them? Alright, maybe they like you. Who wants to know? You? Alright, so that’ll be 34.99 USD per month. I’m runnin’ a business here, ay, come on.\n\nHave I summed up the life of a generally average person? Have I summed up my own life?\n\nProbably more the latter, than the former, because I don’t know you. But I do know me.\n\nYou get home from work, you slap your keyboard and your PC flicks awake, and what do you do? Do you feel like gaming, son? Are ya winning? Are you enjoying those subscriptions? Because, if you wanna play World of Warcraft, get ready to whip out that credit card, numerous times. Oh, you’d rather play a free to play MMO? Keep that card out. At least, if you wanna have any chance of actually enjoying yourself once you catch up with the rest of the players.\n\nBack in 2004, when World of Warcraft launched, the thought of paying for a game, monthly, was almost completely alien to the general public. In 2004, we bought our music one CD at a time, we loaded songs onto our iPods, and we enjoyed it. I ain’t got no time to shovel cash into an ongoing game, what the HECK? Sell that thing for 30 bucks and leave me alone!\n\nCome to think of it, subscriptions weren’t really all that much of a thing back then. I mean, sure, you had to pay for internet service. But we kind of just saw that as another utility. You know, in the days when some of us were graduating high school, and entering jobs that paid 7 dollars an hour.\n\nIn 2004, you had to work at minimum wage for 3 hours before you could afford a month of World of Warcraft … both ways, in the snow, up hill!\n\nAll of this kind of makes me wonder, though: Is World of Warcraft the reason companies like Logitech want to charge monthly in order to click your mouse? Is World of Warcraft the reason I can’t watch Dexter and Doctor Who on the same subscription service? Is this game the reason why everything is pay to use?\n\nI mean, think about it. World of Warcraft launches, subscriptions aren’t some kind of corporate craze during this period of time, and then the game reaches 12 million concurrent players. I don’t know about you, but I think that sent a signal to much of corporate America.\n\nPeople … en masse, are willing to pay monthly to enjoy things? Hmm.\n\nBut the real point of this post isn’t really to tell you, the reader, that things are out of control, and everything’s trying to steal all of your money. We all dun already knowed that.\n\nMy problem is … I find myself kind of, unable to enjoy MMOs anymore. It was my favorite genre for the better half of 20 years. And … now?\n\nBro, do you see my blog posts? I’m playing Gacha games on my phone that circle back to my PC, that I can put money into if I feel like it, or not. Expansive experiences from the likes of Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, at the very conservative price of zero dollars. Forever. Expansions, updates, new characters, open world, endless gameplay. FOR ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY WHATSOEVER.\n\n\n\nIt’s pretty refreshing. Sure, Gacha games are kind of like gambling, but for people who like anime girls and gaming at the same time. But we’re now in an age where a mother frikken’ gacha game is, and this is going to be a very controversial thing to say, better than World of Warcraft.\n\nThe other day I had off of work, and I spent six hours playing Wuthering Waves.\n\nThe heck?\n\nI haven’t played any game for more than an hour, at all, period, for the past three years.\n\nNeedless to say, it all circles back to this subscription hell we’re all in. I gotta subscribe to the shows I wanna watch, the music I wanna hear, the podcasts I wanna listen to, and literally everything else in-between, and then some more. The thought of also paying monthly for a game that has expansions you have to pay for, and a fuggin’ cash shop on top of all of that! No.\n\nNo.\n\nNuh uh.\n\nIt’s 2004 all over again, and I think this might be the end of my love for MMOs.\n\n"

The magazine’s body was found abandoned at the side of the highway, bloodied, and dismembered.”\n\nSo maybe that’s overreacting, or maybe it’s not that far off from the truth. At least, not according to Kotaku.\n\n\n  Staff at the magazine, which also publishes a website, weekly podcast, and online video documentaries about game studios and developers, were all called into a meeting on Friday with parent company GameStop’s VP of HR. In it they were told the publication was closing immediately, they were all laid off, and would begin receiving severance terms. At least one staffer was in the middle of a work trip when the team was told.\n\n\n\n  Every URL for the Game Informer website now redirects to the official statement, erasing more than a decade of articles, reviews, and original reports that helped establish a record of the notoriously secretive and volatile video game industry.\n\n\nIt’s no secret that layoffs have been devastating the game’s industry lately. From Microsoft and Embracer Group killing studios left and right, to Paradox’s “Life By You” Sim’s competitor canceled and binned forever. It’s a sign of inflation, and the coming recession. CEOs and billionaires trying to cash-in as much as they can, at any cost, no matter what happens, before the whole world is wondering where all the money and jobs went.\n\nThe AI bubble has increased this eighty-fold, as companies realize this passing fad is a gigantic waste of money that nobody in the right mind will be using by the end of 2025.\n\nBut … the crisis of the economy aside, it’s just like Gamestop to murder something that has been a cornerstone of what’s left of the nineties for over thirty years. I remember when I was just a kid, reading copies of Game Informer, reading about Tomb Raider, reading about Everquest. I still have a copy of Game Informer (an issue from the nineties) lying around somewhere, and as I grasp hold of the past in any way I possibly can–The corpo-juggernauts swing the pendulum again, and again.\n\nI find myself wishing Geocities was still around, wishing Aol Instant Messenger were still a thing. Wishing we were all still organizing our top friends on Myspace, and playing Mafia Wars on a much less brain-melting version of Facebook.\n\nIt’s easy to romanticize what I felt was good and cool about the past, and look at everything with rose-tinted glasses. But, have you ever considered? Maybe it actually really was better during the nineties.\n\nI mean … we had consoles with no fees for online connections, and games with no forever-patching and hundred dollar DLC. The internet took longer to connect to and it was easy to get bumped offline, but there was so much wonder and excitement involved in connecting and logging on.\n\nWorlds Chat, Yahoo chatrooms, Geocities, cheat code webpages, and flash games.\n\nWe really did have it all, didn’t we?\n\nGeneration Zed caught the tail-end of this, and Alpha will never know what a normal and cool internet looks like, and I feel they’ve missed out on something that was so … defining. Like turning on Breaking Bad only after Walter’s commanded Jesse to a shoot a chemist in the head. And the magazines, what’s wrong with magazines?\n\nFricken crap, man, Apple has a whole section in their news app with digitized magazines you can just read and enjoy, and we couldn’t put Game Informer on that?\n\nFuggin’ shit.\n\nLike, I get it, in the grand scheme of things, it’s just a magazine and there are much greater relics of the nineties that never should have gone away. But it does pain me just a little, every single time the mad rush for infinitely expanding profit kills something I used to know as a child.\n\nAnd it is for that reason that I write down my experiences, and that I share them. Because Gamestop and Microsoft can’t kill my thoughts if I write them down hard enough.\n"

    "url": "/social media/2024/08/05/criticism-doesn-t-exist-if-you-don-t-look-at-it.html",
    "content": "Over the past year, since I’ve started writing much more heavily online, and established a website (despite said website changing at least five times), I’ve written about quite a few controversies. Like how Microsoft is developing AI-fueled spyware, Reddit is copy/pasting Musk’s behavior in their structural decision making, Bluesky is partnering with a company that utilizes OpenAI, and Threads’ new public policy director is an entire fascist. There’s just one problem with all of this, and it’s not only a problem you see with corporations and billionaires, but something that’s been happening more and more as we inch closer to the middle of the 2020s.\n\nCreators, influencers, companies, and the Mega Rich, have realized that if they just … ignore criticism, even for especially heinous behavior, nothing happens.\n\nThis is summed up pretty well in AugustTheDuck’s latest Youtube video, where he speaks about the numerous controversies surrounding Mr. Beast, and how, because of how rich he is, who his audience is (eight year old iPad babies), and where his content is hosted, he’s basically shielded from consequences. Especially if he completely ignores it and pretends it’s not happening.\n\nIn August’s words, “I think we have officially entered into an age of the internet where accountability is basically optional.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past week or so, since the article on Threads that I wrote, detailing who Dustin Carmack is and what he’s done (heritage foundation, Project 2025), I and others have been routinely tagging and mentioning the official Threads and Meta account via their own platform, attempting to question this decision. And, despite posts (including my own) about this reaching an audience of nearly 10,000 people, what do you think they’ve said in response?\n\nNothing.\n\nNow, sure, obviously it’s a little wild to think that the people who run a platform of over 100 million people would actually take time out of their day to respond to the people accusing them of hiring someone who is a threat to the freedom and rights of the American people, but, you know, maybe they should? Maybe they should answer.\n\nBut, it’s like I’ve said now, this is a larger problem online that’s basically sweeping everyone, and every thing. If you don’t respond to it, it didn’t happen.\n\nRecently, DrDisrespect was thought to be cooked, finished, done, after it was revealed, and then he subsequently confessed, that the reason he was banned on Twitch all those years back, is because he’s a pedophile. Well, you’ll be likely unsurprised to know that he’s back, and nothing’s happened.\n\n\npic.twitter.com/vlEk7Yawog— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) July 31, 2024  \n\n\nI’ve also personally seen this phenomenon happening with smaller creators and companies, or even just randoms on the internet who like to think they’re celebrities. People, in-general, doing nasty, reprehensible things, online, being questioned over it, and then responding with nothing but silence. It’s almost like there’s some collective trauma-response to the treatment completely innocent people had received over the years via the disingenuous hell-hole, Twitter. Except … the entirely wrong people are using that to their advantage.\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that absolutely nobody experiences consequences for doing heinous things anymore, because, if we jump back to the beginning of this post and AugustTheDuck’s video, we can easily reference Ava Tyson as someone who has recently dealt with the consequences of exhibiting creepy behavior online.\n\n\nOver the last few days, I’ve become aware of the serious allegations of Ava Tyson's behavior online and I am disgusted and opposed to such unacceptable acts.During that time, I have been focused on hiring an independent third party to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure…— MrBeast (@MrBeast) July 25, 2024  \n\n\nSo … huh, maybe some people do experience consequences and the affects of having to take accountability for their actions. Maybe … people along the lines of societal marginalization, where many are already thought to be predators.\n\nNot arguing in favor of Ava here, she’s set the trans community back twenty years during one of the worst political climates in United States history. But, it definitely does seem like there are those who get away with reprehensible behavior, and those who don’t.\n\nI wonder what it is.\n\nNow, whether people deal with the consequences of their actions or not, is one question, and one thing that does seem to happen with at least some perpetrators of disgusting behavior. But it seems, regardless of whether they do or not, the overall response, the overall strategy in dealing with being faced with your own actions, is to close your eyes, and hold your ears. To this relatively new behavior, I’d like to say: If you can’t have a backbone stiff enough to face the consequences of your actions, maybe you shouldn’t do that stuff in the first place. Seems like a simple enough solution. I’m sure this behavior will continue though, because I believe it’s rooted in a much bigger problem. A problem wherein narcissism has become such a normalized mode-of-operation, that it is now a legitimate social media strategy.\n\nAnyway.\n\nUh, … I have a headache.\n\n"

    "url": "/gaming/2024/08/06/warframe-revisited-again.html",
    "content": "\n\nA while back, I posted about The First Descendant and how, despite feeling clunky, and not really having satisfying gun play, it at least seemed to have the ability to satisfy more than Warframe. I may have been wrong about that. I may have sold Warframe a little short in being offered a new, shiny thing that lost its luster pretty damn quickly.\n\nSo, let’s talk about the shooter-grinder that maybe started it all.\n\nThis story goes back all the way to 2014, around a year after Warframe had originally released. I was dating a locksmith at the time. Not very integral to the story, because her being a locksmith has nothing to do with Warframe … It was just, you know, the biggest thing I remember about her (aside from, a year later, telling me she didn’t think I was dating material). But, she was staying at my place, and I remember distinctly waking up in the morning to her, on my PC, playing this weird … ninja space game. It had almost no features, no story, and really all you did was click a mission, then shoot things, and then pick up some loot. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nThere were no flying ship animations, no rotating solar maps, nothing.\n\nI got into it for about a week or so before I realized I couldn’t really take playing a game that was technically in open beta, or even alpha? I don’t remember. So, I dropped it. I would revisit it again and again, shooting things, leveling up, and then losing motivation. Until suddenly, one day, the star map was moving, and you could see the ship you were on flying to those missions.\n\nAmazing.\n\nBut I kept going in and out of it like tossing out pairs of socks. At least until around 2016 when an online friend convinced me to join her, because there was some ridiculous mission we had to do called “the Second Dream.”\n\nLet’s just say, it blew me away. Finally. A character creator? And, a story? Albeit, you’re some kind of Stranger Things-esque powerful teenager who pilots these metal space ninjas, but it was something. Evangelion, maybe.\n\nI spent a week figuring out what all was new, ran around with my new human legs, found an open world thing on Earth …\n\nYeah, I left the game again … until 2018, and the Fortuna update. Needless to say, I was blown away, again. And, after getting frustrated that I couldn’t just have the cool new guns and my own hoverboard in a reasonable amount of time … I left.\n\nThis basically is the theme behind my relationship with Digital Extremes and Warframe. I’m the rubber-band player. Getting real excited about all the honestly really cool stuff, and revolutionary storytelling, and then having my motivation riddled with bullets and swords when faced with the prospect of having to spend time collecting things and grinding reputation.\n\nThe cycle begins again.\n\nIt’s 2024, and I’m back in Warframe, enticed by some wild new expansion announcement that apparently takes you back to … 1999??? HUH?\n\nSo, I’m swallowing the grind pill, and I’m doing it. Knocking every mission out, one by one, and I’m almost to the New War.\n\n\n\nBut, here are my feelings about Warframe, all these years later.\n\nA space ninja MMO is freaking awesome. I have like, 20 different warframes, and some of them I’ve never even tried. I’m account level 8, almost 9, and I’m working on upgrading my own massive capital ship (called a Railjack). The story is gripping, wild, and probably some of the best writing I’ve ever seen in a game, and I cannot wait to get through to more recent content.\n\nBut, despite swallowing that pill, and despite working through toward what I want, that’s the one problem that remains with Warframe. The game absolutely disrespects your time as a human being.\n\nThe Second War: Hey buddy, you need a Railjack and a Necramech before you can continue the story. Frikken’ scrub.\n\nOkay, so I have the Railjack, in which you use to engage in space combat that isn’t all that much unlike combat in No Man’s Sky. But … the Necramech? Oh … Oh, you gotta grind a bunch of materials on the dead moon Deimos before you can build it?\n\nQueue the internal screaming. This is why I’ve left the game 40 times since 2014. I’m not a fan of grinding. I have a full-time job, I have extracurricular things I like to do with my time. Spending hours upon hours collecting materials, so I can build a mech, so I can engage in yet another form of combat, so I can continue the masterfully crafted storyline … it seems to me like needless barriers to get to what you actually want.\n\nThe GAME.\n\nBut, sure, I mean, yeah. They need hooks to keep you playing, because if you blast through the storyline, and you don’t have to do anything else, you lose your player base. I just wish grinding didn’t feel like I suddenly had a second job. But … I’M GONNA DO IT. I’m not quitting this time.\n\nFor real.\n\nIf you wanna help me out, my account name is CMDR_N0va.\n\nMy overall feelings on Warframe are that it’s probably one of the best games ever made, that kind of annoys the absolute hell out of me … at times.\n"

    "content": "Ever since I started a store in Second Life, I’ve always wanted to own my own full sim. There were reasons that wasn’t possible in the past, and reasons that became possible in the now, or, at least, around the beginning of 2023. It was quite the chunk of money to maintain, but I built by hand my own rendition of a sci-fi/cyberpunk city I used to visit in my earlier days. This is one of the reasons I have had such a hard time shutting it down, and saving my money. To … stop paying one hundred dollars a month for something people really only pass through in seconds and minutes.\n\nOf course, my store gets constant traffic, and it’s been consistent in sales for over eight years now, and that’s amazing.\n\nBut running a sim, if even a homestead, is a whole other beast. It’s neat to have, it’s pretty, it’s huge, and you can do whatever you want. But it’s costly. And building a community, pulling people in, that’s not really something I have the energy to do on my own, you know?\n\nI’ve got a full-time job. I’m trying to consistently make funny and neat content as a video “producer” of sorts. I have a whole album I need to get working on, and that’s not to mention the book I’m also writing, that hasn’t seen any development in months.\n\nWhen I say, I really don’t have the time and energy to get people to come together, and be a community, I don’t.\n\nAnd then there’s inflation, and everything being expensive, and my priorities changing as the years go on.\n\nSo, as of today, Neo Machina will actually be shutting down as of August 31st, 2024. Maybe sometime in the future when I have an extra thousand dollars a month to kick around, that I don’t need for anything else, I’ll bring it back, or maybe someone else will pick up the torch.\n\nEither way, it was fun building and running my own city.\n\nAnd I want to be clear, so that I don’t sound like the owners of IYC, I’m not blaming people who did or didn’t come to Neo Machina. There are so many places in Second Life to choose from, and people with much more free time and energy than I have, and more power to them. It’s not anyone’s fault that I’m taking the city down, I just gotta save my money, and evaluate where my priorities should be. I am grateful to those who came by, those who decided to live there for a time, and those who enjoyed it.\n\nI hope Neo Machina will be a piece of your Second Life memories.\n\nBut this isn’t an episode of mourning. One of the reasons I kept bringing it back online the last couple of times I took it down, was because I kept look at this as like, the death of a friend. The death of my own work.\n\nThat’s not how we look at these things.\n\nNeo Machina was an art piece. It was performance art, an experiment. And, like a lot of art, it comes, it goes, and it transforms. Like Walter White in his chemistry: Decay, and then transformation.\n\nKeep your head up, choom. You never know what could happen next.\n"

    "content": "\n\nI’ve already written on here, quite extensively about “AI”, and how harmful it is. But, sometimes you come across something so egregious, so disgusting, so malignant that you just have to record it. Record it so, a year from now, we can all look back on how hilariously bad this all was, and how people who refuse to learn how to do anything, are now forced to wallow in sadness as their theft-tools are decommissioned.\n\nPeople like this. I can’t help but feel … seething hatred for this kind of flippant, sociopathic attitude toward artists, and creators, just because you feel entitled to the work they’ve done via algorithmic machines that rip them off.\n\n\n      Post by @neon_universal  View on Threads\n\n\n\nCompanies are quickly beginning to realize that “AI” is not profitable, and a large portion of people either don’t care about it, or don’t want to use it. And this is bad, considering the extreme power consumption and costs these things generate (Microsoft has dabbled in the idea of building nuclear reactors to power their theft algorithms). It turns out, if you just shove AI into everything, it won’t make people any more predisposed to using it. But it will make you and your company look like a bunch of frauds. See: Bluesky partners with Buffer.\n\nIt’s always been evident that there are groups of people out there who hate artists. A hate that’s bred out of envy. It’s also been extremely evident that a lot of people don’t, and have never wanted to pay for the entertainment that they enjoy. Be it books, movies, and especially music. Because, obviously, the people who make the things that fill out all of your free time don’t deserve to make a living, am I right? (/sarcasm)\n\nAnd now you have these AI-tech-guys, who’ve never experienced an iota of creative inspiration in their entire lives, and a lot of which have probably never done any amount of serious work, either, loading up these machines filled with stolen media, and posting aggressively disgusting things on social sites, like, “Haha the artists are mad we stole from them! This is how it’s going to be, get used to it!”\n\nIt makes me wish “The Purge” was real, but instead of targeting people who can’t afford to protect themselves, it just targets people like the aforementioned, untalented losers, and then we remove them from civilized society. Permanently.\n\nBut, listen: I’m glad these people will never feel what it’s actually like to create something. I’m glad they’ll never experience the joy of practicing, spending years learning, and making something that people actually enjoy. If there’s any silver-lining to take away from this past year or so of horrendous techno-theft and crime, it’s that, at the end of the day, they will always be hollow, meaningless, scum, who never amount to anything notable, or genuine.\n\n"

I haven’t really been slacking, just … brain-jumbled for ideas. I also want to make more little short videos for my Tiktok and Instagram. But, another thing I want to do, is start using these blog updates on my website to address my Patreon, considering I do still have somewhat of an audience there.\n\nI’m always writing here, anyway, and I like to keep things … in a singular place, as much as I possibly can.\n\nSo, anyway.\n\n[REVOSA] MOVES\n\nIn my last update, I mentioned that I was finally deciding to shutter Neo Machina (at least, for the foreseeable future), and that my store would move to its own parcel where it would stand in perpetuity, or until something bigger comes along.\n\nThat location, is here.\n\nI haven’t really made anything for my store in quite a while, but a lot of that has to do with creative energy, and the absolute vampire that my offline job is. But, like everything else, there’s still more stuff coming!\n\nPatreon & Apple Issues\n\nOn the topic of Patreon, Apple will soon begin taking a 30% cut from patrons who subscribe to any Patreon page via the iOS app. As much as I like Apple tech, and the Apple stuff that I own, this is kind of an unfortunate update to things. I don’t know how many people actually subscribe via the Patreon app, but you may want to consider switching your subscriptions to the desktop site.\n\nIt just blows my mind, a multi-billion dollar company that mostly dominates the tech market as Microsoft commits multiple self-owns in the course of a couple of months, and yall’st guys really gotta go rent-seeking this hard?\n\nIt’s a fluster buck.\n\nI’ve opted to simply increase tier prices via the iOS Patreon app, because I refuse to pay their fees. And I, again, highly recommend you do not subscribe to my content via the app on your phone.\n\nTHE MAMMOTH\n\nOn the topic of iOS, today I discovered a new(ish?) iOS Mastodon app. If you’re on an iPhone, and you use Mastodon as frequent as you used to use Twitter, I would highly recommend downloading the Mammoth app. Especially if you’re new to Mastodon, and wanting easier ways to connect with people, and find the content you might enjoy seeing. I recommend this app for that, because it makes bringing content to your timeline much easier than any other app I’ve ever seen. For real.\n\nAlso, the developers seem to have taken a little inspiration from the Bluesky UI, in that they’ve built in tabs that you can use to craft your own feeds, or feeds of special interests you may have. This is definitely something Mastodon has needed for a long time.\n\nI love the fediverse, but one of the biggest issues I’ve always experienced while navigating it, is that it’s still … really tough to find things I want to read, and see. That’s not to say I don’t enjoy seeing the people on my timeline. I do! But I’ve always wanted to also see more tech, more linux, more gaming, and so on and so forth.\n\nMammoth makes that much simpler.\n\nGo download it, immediately.\n\nOther STUFF\n\nAside from all of that …\n\nI’ve decided that in continuing to compose music for my next album, I think I want to keep using my Macbook for that. Using FL Studio on Linux has been real hacky, and on my Macbook I just … already have everything setup for what I normally do.\n\nAs for the book, Dissolution Protocol, I’m starting to feel like I could continue writing that, again. We’ll see.\n\nTo my patrons on Patreon, I will continue uploading exclusive content for those who are paying to be there. But I definitely feel like I want to keep my public updates, here, on my website. It just makes more sense to me. Patreon has never felt like a real kind of viable platform for blogging. These things are much better when you’re doing it on your own website, and writing both the content, and the code.\n\nI hope all’s well with all yall’st, and be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed if this is your first time here. I’ll be keeping updates going, and if you’re in the Discord server, you’ll see them pop each time I upload a new post, in the blog-updates channel.\n\nAnyway, peace, chooms!\n\n"

But it brought up some thoughts, and interesting points. There are some people who refuse to abandon Twitter. Sex workers, parts of the LGBTQ+ community, and so on. Despite being an attack vector for everyone who hates the aforementioned with every fiber of their being, some of these people still resume their patronage to the Musk-site, hotbed of misinformation and algorithmic content scraping.\n\nRecently, I finally downloaded my Tweet archive, and deactivated my account. Making Mastodon my main place to be.\n\nAnd it’s strange to me, do these people not know that Mastodon/the fediverse has quite a few LGBTQ+ and/or sex worker positive instances? Is dealing with some weirdo nerdy tech-guys who act like puritans on the federated timeline somehow more of a problem, than congregating on a website that is deteriorating on a daily basis, as the infrastructure crumbles as if being eaten alive by termites? Than congregating on a website where people will hurl slurs at you, and experience no consequences whatsoever?\n\nNo, I don’t think it is.\n\n\n\n\n\nJokes aside, what I want to do, is show you some Mastodon/fediverse instances you can join in order to continue your work, whatever that may be, without indirectly supporting a dunce who hasn’t genuinely created anything in his life and has benefited from the exploitation of working people since the day he was born.\n\nSo, here are some of those instances you can check out that are either LGBTQ+/Queer and sex worker friendly, or simply LGBTQ+/Queer friendly, free from the tendrils of Elon Musk’s failure machine, Bluesky’s corporate board, who’ve recently partnered with a company that utilizes OpenAI, and the Thread’s public policy maker, who coincidentally is also an author on Project 2025.\n\nNote: Some of these instances are not hosted on the Mastodon client, rather some on Misskey, or Akkoma, and other pieces of custom fediverse software. This does not take away from the experience, and I encourage you to check them all out, regardless.\n\n\n  mkultra.monster :: Obviously, I’m going to put my instance on here first, because it’s been running since February (2024), and it is and always has been LGBTQ+ and sex worker friendly, and it will stay that way.

I realize this specific point may be a deal-breaker for some. But, if that’s the case, maybe Twitter really is the only place you can be. But, honestly? Warning people about nudity, in the very least, is something … everyone should be doing, everywhere. It’s not about being prude, or puritans, but more about social consent.\n\nI’ll be keeping this list updated with new additions, or removals as needed.

    "content": "Today, for … uhm, whatever reason? Github went plop. It fell down. It shat itself. Its servers went down completely and totally. And I didn’t even really notice until hours, and hours after they’d already started investigating. And then … it came back!\n\nBut this sort of thing has me looking at back-up alternatives for hosting my Jekyll site. Neocities seems like the immediate best place to back everything up with a mirrored version of my website. The problem, is that using the Neocities CLI doesn’t appear to … overwrite updated files? And then, if you decide instead to setup “Deploy to Neocities” as a workload on Github, it works! … But since Jekyll is a static site generator, and the site is already generated once hitting your repository, the upload is just … Blank front matter.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat needs to go to Neocities, from the Github deployment, is everything in the generated _site folder … which doesn’t seem to exist on the server side of things (it’s definitely on my hdd, and is only built upon pushing to Git).\n\nSo that’s the conundrum, although, the weird thing is, other people seem to have figured this out?\n\nIf only there were a way to push the deployment to Github where and when it’s built also to Neocities, without having to specify a directory in the Neocities workflow (because there is no correct directory to push to NC via your repository, unless I’ve made some kind of huge blunder and am blind).\n\nNevertheless, if anyone reading this is experienced with all of the aforementioned things and wants to explain what I’m missing, I’d be very appreciative! I would love to have a backup that automatically pushes to Neocities whenever I commit to my branch on Github. But … with Jekyll, and the way it works, that doesn’t seem possible.\n\nAt least, not in the way I want to do it.\n\nI suppose if Github takes a spiral and farts, and doesn’t come back, I could just as easily deploy this entire site onto a blank droplet on Digital Ocean, but I would like to avoid paying for more stuff, for now. Therefore, Neocities is the best place for a backup/mirror … just in case.\n\n… if I can figure out the issue of what the heck I’m supposed to deploy to Neocities from my repository here on Github.\n"

    "content": "Lately, or, for the past few days, I’ve been messing around in VR Chat, the virtual world that aims to be Second Life, but with a strict, “Keep the NSFW stuff in private” sort of … uh, place.\n\nYou’ll find out why that is pretty much as soon as you join any public world that is simultaneously PC and VR compatible. Parents … offloading their children into a Meta Quest so that they can terrorize (I’m being sarcastic) the virtual population.\n\nJokes aside, I’m not really one to call kids squeakers, but if you don’t want to deal with them you can just as easily jump into PC only worlds.\n\nIt is for sure a much more immersive experience if you put on your headset, but if you’re not really feeling the whole, sweat and face marks vibe, you can just load it up as if it were Second Life. On your computer. And hey, it works on Linux too … although, you have to verify file integrity pretty much every single time, because their anti-cheat will disconnect you if it detects issues.\n\nAlso, why is there anti-cheat in a virtual world?\n\nAnyway, I’ve jumped in and out of VR Chat over the past couple of years, mostly using random default avatars the game offers. But, I felt like I wanted to make a deep dive, or deeper dive, and so I browsed Gumroad for a bit.\n\nAnd I bought an avatar.\n\n\n\nBack in 2013 when I rejoined Second Life on a secondary account (not sure why I made a new account back then), I sort of immediately fell in with the furry community. I paraded around in a female anthropomorphic fox avatar pretty much at all times.\n\nI tried to find some screenshots of this avatar, but for whatever reason, they’re nowhere to be found. I’m sure they’re around somewhere, though. I just don’t have the patience to search for them.\n\nThis lasted for about a year or so, and went on through a relationship I had going on within Second Life, and then … well, we broke up. And, things felt kind of sour for me. My interests took a major shift, and I became an Asari (Mass Effect) avatar, and then a human, and then a human vampire, and then a vampire human cybernetic being, of sorts (it’s a long story).\n\nNeedless to say, I kind of lost track of where I came from in Second Life, and, funnily enough, my initial shot at taking VR Chat seriously has landed me back into the exact same position I experienced a decade ago. Except I’m much worse at meeting people and making connections.\n\nThat aside, I wanted to share some really neat places I found. You should absolutely check them out if you need a break from twelve year olds screaming Tiktok memes at you.\n\n(You have to make an account and log in to see these world links)\n\nORGANISM (v 1.5) :: This is a really cool world. It’s not a game, it’s not filled with mirrors: It’s a liminal experience, much like the backrooms, but not the backrooms, at all. It tells a story through exploration, and I don’t know, dude, you just have to go there and experience it for yourself.\n\nBeyond a Bit :: This is another immersive sort of experience. It lasts around 10 minutes or so, and is mostly what I would call a visual musical experience. Go give it a look!\n\nThe Backrooms :: When I first loaded into this world, I expected some cheap version of the Backrooms where it’s cartoony chaos. But! That’s not what this is at all. Or, at least not entirely. There are some, or at least one of the ridiculous entities that I think kind of break the actual scary vibes of what Backrooms is really supposed to be. But, if you want to take a load off and literally wander mesmerizing, seemingly endless halls of the Backrooms, this is that place.\n\nI haven’t really given myself much of a chance to really explore, but this is what I’ve found so far, and all three of these places are far away from the usual experience you get from joining random worlds.\n\nIf you’re in there, give me an add! My username is cmdr_nova.\n\n"

Sometimes it’s a molehill, and sometimes it’s a mountain.\n\nIt’s not really a secret that I’ve been struggling with credit card debt ever since I had to take my previously passed-away cat to the vets, wherein I was slammed with over 3000 dollars USD worth of medical bills.\n\nThat was almost two years ago now, and I think I’ve only chipped away at that debt.\n\nThe weight of this was heavy enough. Working, not really being able to afford much more than entertainment and pleasantries. And saving a little here, and a little there.\n\nIt’s not really untrue that my Second Life store doesn’t make any money. It does. It brings in about 20 dollars worth of sales every month, and has done, for years, and years. Most of that money is generated from online marketplace sales that people do casually, in their internet browsers.\n\nWell. Today I took my car in for inspection, and lo and behold, it needs some serious work done in order to pass that inspection, and that serious work will cost me about 1900 dollars USD. I don’t have a credit card that can support a charge this high. I’m still paying on veterinarian fees from two years ago.\n\nSo, out of pocket, is the way I have to go. With money I’ve been trying to save. Money I’ve been keeping as a pillow, some kind of cushion. Money that will be gone in an instant, and put me back into a place I haven’t been for five years.\n\nIt is with much regret, that I’ve decided to, along with canceling a majority of my subscriptions that I’ve had, purely for entertainment sake, that I also must close my store. At least in-world.\n\n[REVOSA] will now exist solely on the Second Life marketplace website, and I believe, after almost ten years, this is fine. The store had a great run in-world, and I’ve had a lot of fun over the years. Its necessity though, is no longer a priority I can manage, and the amount of money Linden Labs charges in order to keep these things running is no longer something I can rightfully support. Not while I’m facing down these massive charges, just so I can have a vehicle to get to and from work.\n\nI don’t know if anyone was hoping that it would stick around, but to anyone who was, I apologize.\n\nMaybe someday, when credit card companies aren’t sucking the life out of me, and mechanics aren’t taking everything I own for a car repair, we can start this all over again.\n\nBut, until then …\n\n"

    "url": "/fundraiser/2024/08/17/urgent-financial-help-needed.html",
    "content": "So, yesterday, I basically shuttered my Second Life store in order to, pretty much immediately stop paying Linden Labs any money whatsoever in order to have land, and access to group space needed for both hosting my store in-world, and maintaining groups for promotion. As of right now, my little venture in Second Life is pretty much over.\n\nBut, that does save me some money.\n\nHere’s why:\n\nI took my car in for inspection, and was informed that part of the steering column needs to be replaced (the u-joint shaft), or it can’t pass inspection. Since I’m still paying on this car to Carvana and the loan they gave me in order to have it, and I need this car in order to go to and from work, I can’t really say “No.” I’ve already had to drop 900 USD, and in a week or so when I go back, and they have the part delivered, I’ll have to pay 800 or so more in order to finish it. This is non-negotiable, and must be done. And this will happen, before I even get paid anything more from my job. I’m running on the fumes of money I’ve been trying to save in order to stay on my own two feet.\n\nIn the interest of full transparency, like I mentioned on my semi-dormant Tumblr account, I’ve cancelled most of my frivolous subscriptions. That includes Netflix, Youtube, frivolous storage for my Pokemon, my personal Minecraft server I was using for members of my Discord, and space on Google Drive. The only things I’m paying for now, outside of credit card debt from the last time I had to pay some company thousands of dollars, are hosting for my Mastodon instance, and my Proton mail (plus redirects and custom domains). Obviously these are two things I want to keep, and would like to not get rid of.\n\nHere are some links, for various ways that you can help out, directly:\n\nBandcamp: Eyeshadow 2600 FM and PLEXX :: I make music, and have made music since 2017. I’m currently working on my next album under PLEXX, and will likely release this sometime soon in the near future.\n\nPatreon: Link :: I’ve been running this Patreon since 2013, spanning things I’ve written in rough drafts for books, member music release downloads, my (now shuttered) Second Life store (since it began), and, more recently, financial backing for my Mastodon instance, for anyone who wants to support it.\n\nKo-fi: Link :: I recently setup a Ko-fi as an alternative to Patreon, for basically the same reasons, but it hadn’t and hasn’t really taken off as a place where people would rather be. But, it’s an option!\n\nGofundme: Link :: I recently setup a Gofundme in order to field finding financial help for the debt I’m already in from having to pay vets for medical reasons, and then the cremation of my older cat. Those are bills I’ve been paying for over two years now.\n\nPaypal: Link :: This is my Paypal.me, although I was informed by their customer service that they’ve discontinued the .me pages for business accounts (I’m only a business account because at one time I was accepting payments for my music directly on Paypal), so I’m not even sure if this works.\n\nThat’s it! Obviously, the books I’ve written over a decade ago could be another avenue, but payments for books purchased are paid out once a month, at the end of every month (and I don’t really even make any book sales). It’s too bad I haven’t even remotely come close to finishing the current book I’m working on.\n\nWho I am:\n\nYears back I started transition, what some would call in out-of-date terminology, male to female, a trans woman. I experienced some … really not great treatment in my job at the time, and was pretty much forced out of it. This was kind of a shock to me, and looking back, I feel like this is where a lot of my anxiety comes from. I would say I exhibit some amounts of PTSD, but I’ve never had the financial security in order to be able to visit a therapist. Resulting from discrimination, harassment, I isolated myself at home for five years. During that time, many online would definitely know me by the name of Meryl S. Kavanagh, wherein I began a Second Life store in an attempt to replace my income. And then, in 2017, I started making music in another attempt to do the same thing (after patching things up with my family, I eventually returned to using my original, birth name).\n\nDespite having some success, and even a bestselling album, I garnered more harassment, more hate, and more discrimination from those within the Twitter synthwave community (there is evidence of this posted on Instagram, but I don’t believe this is the place I want to share it).\n\nThis is around the time I made a full-stop on my transition, and returned to the offline workforce. I don’t consider this a detransition, and I don’t consider myself to have exited the LGBTQ+ community. I still have questions about my gender identity, and even if I eventually found out that maybe I’m fine the way I am now, I’m also not straight, if that matters. But, that is also a very well kept secret from most people in my offline life, and it’s on a need-to-know basis.\n\nI share these things, again, in the interest of full transparency. In order to convey, to you, the reader, that I’m not just some random person who came out of nowhere asking for help.\n\nI changed my online handle from merylsk to cmdr_nova in 2020, and for a time, in 2022, delved into making an NFT project with my own two hands. Drawn on an iPad. This got featured by the main pre-Musk Twitter account, and despite losing some friends during my admittedly mistake of a choice to participate in this fad, I made some money. Enough to buy new glasses, a new phone, and get myself into a new car … the same car that is in need of nearly 2000 dollars in repairs. And none of that NFT money is left, it has been years since then.\n\nToday, I’m still making music (as evidenced above), I’m still writing books, and although I’ve shuttered my Second Life store, I also run a Mastodon instance that is open to any, and safe for LGBTQ+ individuals as well. I do not plan to close my Mastodon instance. If there is anything I’ll fight to keep, it’s the ability to run my own space on the fediverse, free from admins who might ban me on a whim (which has happened, at least five times) for unserious, bad reasons.\n\nThat’s my entire story, shared in as small of a byte of text as I can possibly muster. If you’ve valued the work I’ve done, the writing I’ve done, the music I’ve done, and everything else, please consider offering a helping hand as I empty what I have in order to just keep my car.\n\nThank you.\n"

Oh, but what if they could? What if, after I share this update via my own Mastodon account, all replies to that post came directly to this post, here, on my website. Well, buddy, ol’ pal. That’s exactly what happens now.\n\nNot only that, but as mentioned in my changelog, there is now a very simple Mastodon-share button under every single post.\n\nBefore I go any further, I want to credit both of the people here, who made this possible.\n\nI’d like to thank @autinerd@chaos.social for their really simple, and also extremely awesome Mastodon share button, that works with a pop-up and requires no workarounds, whatsoever. And then I’d like to thank @jwildeboer@social.wildeboer.net for his quick and easy guide to getting Mastodon comments to show up on your Jekyll site, with only a little bit of fiddling (which I don’t mind, I write all of my posts in frikken’ VS Code).\n\nThese things are really important, because … if you haven’t noticed, ActivityPub is the future of the internet. You can see Meta connecting Threads to our little corner of the internet, just so they can be part of it, and you see protocols like Nostr and ATP trying to do their own thing and … kind of sort of missing the mark. The future of the internet is user hosted and user maintained. Which is funny. Because that’s almost exactly what the internet was in 1995.\n\nIf there is an ActivityPub implementation that can be done with CSS and Javascript, you can bet your fluffy tail I’m going to put it onto this website. And I’m sure there’s more, such as syndicating every post to my Mastodon account, without any need to share it manually. But that? I think I’ll wait on that for another time, as today has been very busy in web development for me.\n\nI also made the navigation hamburger a defined size, and scrollable, so that I can put as much crap in there as I want, and not burden your screen, whether you’re browsing this on your clunky Debian laptop, or your shiny new iPhone 15, it should now be one uniform size. Hopefully.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to make an update on this, and hand out some thank-yous and corresponding links so that anyone else interested in doing these things, can easily find them.\n\nEnjoy your weekends!\n"

Sure, it still technically exists on the Second Life marketplace site, and sales do come in through that platform, it’s just not the same as actually having a presence in Second Life. And, I really do think that, after all these years, maybe it really is time to move on to bigger things. Things that don’t cost you money for every little thing you do. Obviously, I’m referencing Linden Labs (of Second Life) charging for uploads, charging for land, charging for “premium” features (that are basically essential if you’re running a store), and so on and so forth.\n\nI wanna buy a house, someday, you know? I don’t even wanna know how much of my money has escaped into Second Life, just maintaining this store.\n\nSo, now we look at VR Chat. A place that is, admittedly, littered with children … if you only visit the VR worlds. I mentioned in another post my slight disdain for parents who basically “drop their kids off” into a Meta Quest so that strangers can babysit them.\n\nThankfully, the VRC furry community is a place of all walks of life. Albeit, in a mostly voice-only client, you do run into, or find toxic people a bit easier, but I just mute them.\n\nI bring up the idea of “rebuilding” in VR Chat, though, because, as far as I can tell, it doesn’t cost you anything to upload content into the client itself. It’s just … a bit more fiddly, and I’m still trying to figure out how to do it, or get it working while running Linux (I will not install Windows!). But, essentially, I don’t even think I have to? It seems I can just erect a Gumroad page, and start reworking my Second Life creations for VR Chat. Seems pretty legit.\n\nI definitely want to give this all more of a look, and dive into … maybe bringing some of my SL stuff into VRC, or at least, Gumroad.\n\nWhat I want to know: Are there any established creators in VRC who have some tips?\n\nOr, better yet, do you wanna share with me some worlds that you think are essential to visit? (I’ve seen plenty of PC/VR mixed worlds, but I’m looking for the good stuff)\n\nEither way, thanks for stopping by!\n"

    "content": "You’ve heard of the old-web revival lurking in the underground of the furthest reaches of internet-space, now get ready for: Actual Geocities pages, archived in an easy to navigate interface! I’ve been lurking the Melonland forums, and searching around websites people have built, and one of the main complaints, or issues I see, is people are using Gifcities to kind of “gamble” their way into finding actual cool gifs, blinkers, badges, and banners. And, while this might be effective sometimes, I’d like to direct people interested in collecting old-net artifacts, or those who’d just like a little bit of nostalgia, to Restoritaveland. This comes complete with Geocities neighborhood navigation, and although I don’t think it has every site ever made on Geocities … it’s possible, you might just find something you’ve made, if you’re as old as me.\n\nIt’s not just an archive of easily viewable websites. It also kind of gives you a sense, or an idea of what it was actually like to navigate Geocities. Of course, if you really want to see what it was like, you can view snapshots on the Waybackmachine.\n\n\n\nWhat it was really like, though, was the most basic kind of social media. So basic, it really wasn’t social media, at all. Basically, you would setup your account, and then you’d be given some account details, and … if I recall correctly, there was a built-in wysiwyg editor (what you see is what you get). That could be wrong though. I think a built in editor was a bit advanced for 1996. I do remember, that most people, including myself, at the time, used Microsoft Frontpage. This was just a drag and drop website design tool. Something that I personally used up until the year 2000 when I started writing everything by hand.\n\nI also don’t remember if the webrings were built into the Geocities interface, or if it was something users came up with themselves in order to connect more easily with other people. But, I’m inclined to believe it was something introduced by Yahoo themselves, since all websites were kept in themed “neighborhoods.”\n\nHonestly, between deciding not to buy Google, and then missing two or three more chances to save themselves, shutting down GS was one of their worst decisions. They have to know, at this point, that literally everyone would jump onboard if they just suddenly resurrected it.\n\nBut anyway, why I’m really writing this post tonight, is because I wanted to share a few pages that I think are really neat, and really convey what the average mindset was like on the internet back in the 90s. There was, of course, plenty of people arguing in chatrooms, and due to the fact that we’re all humans, toxicity is something that is inevitable. But … on people’s own webpages, most of the time, that’s not what you found. So, allow me to share with you some time capsules of a better era.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Basil’s page of wonders.\n\n\n  You made it! I’ve got to wonder are you a new person or have you had my website saved for 6 years and periodically return to it? It is amazing that it wasn’t deleted, but then I do like this yahoo login so I’ve kept this page in such a manner. I mean… how else could I subscribe to the Ducaine Group without a yahoo account? The DuCaine group… I have sadly been slacking off with my reading too. Anywho…\n\n\n\n  A Page of Wonders? What was I thinking?? Do you feel like you’re watching a Disney movie or else stuck in Kingdom Hearts? Which is a good game and everyone should play it.\n\n\n\n  Well you may have asked for a link to see what I look like.\n\n\n\n  Well here are some pictures that you wanted:  Basil’s Pictures Too bad these are like 6-8 years outdated. I wish I looked like that. Or at least weighed that much. I may have new pictures posted. Or I may decide that updating this page is a waste a time. I kind of like having these relics of a time long ago.\n\n\n\n  REMEMBER YOU ARE NOT ALONE!\n\n\nA page that was maintained until around 2002 or so, speaking about a time six years before, back into the 90s and referring to it as a relic. It seems we already knew what Geocities was destined to be, even while it still existed. But that’s not why I like this page. I like it because it’s … just pure, and simple genuine humanity. Just someone being … themselves. Just kind of doing whatever.\n\nShe’s not posting stuff like, “Did you know Mars is exploding, click here now to find out why” or some other clickbait garbage. She’s not making incorrect statements or arguments in order to get two thousand people commenting to drive up engagement stats so that she can sell you something.\n\nIt’s just a person. Personing.\n\nNext up, of course I had to visit the Nova neighborhood.\n\nWelcome to Caedmonette’s homepage.\n\n\n\n\n  Welcome To My Pages.\n\n\n\n  This character was originally\nconcieved on 10/31/98,\nthen moved to Elendor (TTII mud)\non 12/26/02\nNow, she has found her home at\nin FFXI\n\n\nI hardly know what this page is talking about, aside from a character that appears to be an OC they made in the Lord of the Rings universe. And in the very early 2000s when the first Final Fantasy MMO came out, they moved their character idea into that game.\n\nThis page caught my attention though, because it has fully in-tact midi files playing in the background. If you view the source code, you may find a way to extract it, but the only name it has to go by is “heroes.mid.”\n\nBut this is yet another example of a person just being a person on the long-lost internet.\n\nThe final site I’d like to portray here for you, before you go off and look at everything for yourself, is something that is … a wonder to perceive.\n\nWelcome to anonymous user’s little anime page, last updated in 1999 (it’s actually a little tough to find pages that people didn’t keep updating all the way to 2009).\n\n\n\n\n  Welcome to my little anime page. I hope you like it enough to come back some time this millenium.\n\n\n\n  Here is a link to my home page: I.H.O.P. International house of Pikachu\n\n\n\n  HEY! Check this out . This link takes you to the trailor for the new pokemon movie.\n\n\n\n  Click here to go to the transport dock, which is a way station between the different parts of my site.\n\n\nAs you can tell by the quotes, this person has embedded many links into the front matter of their page. The first link goes to a dead Angelfire page (get this: angelfire was something like a sister of geocities, and unlike geocities, angelfire is still alive!), the second link actually downloads a video straight to your PC, and it works. And then the final link takes you to even more pages. Everything is nearly illegible overtop photos of anime girls, but the maze of pages abruptly stops with the promise of more pages. This is kind of how I approached web design in the 90s. I would make a Nine Inch Nails fan-page about halfway, and then write a little promise for anyone visiting that I would continue and finish it at a later time, and then I’d abandon it and start over with a new account with a brand new obsession.\n\nBut this is all just a taste. You have to find the real gems for yourself, because that was one of the best parts of Geocities, and one of the most important parts about rebuilding the old web. Discovery, connection. Reading other people’s thoughts, expressing themselves, or yourself, genuinely. I don’t think you need to copy the aesthetic completely, although it is certainly pretty cool if you do! But I’ve mostly written this in order to share, and to show those who may not have been around for it, an inch of what it was like. I need people to know, that looking back on what the internet was in the 90s and calling it the best version of the internet, is absolutely not hyperbole at all.\n\nThis is what they took from you.\n\nOkay, maybe that’s a little dramatic. It is all just code after-all, and it thrives even now. But goshdangit, Bobby, there are some things we just shouldn’t have lost, you know?\n\n"

And then, here in the twilight hours of Saturday night, August 24th, I realized what my problem is.\n\nI like to surf the old Geocities pages. Pretend I’m still like 11 or something, and read what people used to say to themselves on their pages. And that’s just it. That’s what people were doing. They were just … saying things. Like they were on some kind of long-form Twitter. Stuff like …\n\n\n  Hi guys, I put this website up today to showcase my favorite show the X-Files, also I had a cheeseburger earlier and man was it tasty. Also did you notice Yahoo has an iframe now?\n\n\nAnd it’s just like that, the whole time. People aren’t really thinking about these massive posts that they’re sure people will want to read. Nah, screw that. It doesn’t matter.\n\nThe ethos of people, heck, even me in the 90s, were to just write stuff and don’t worry about it.\n\nThat’s the problem.\n\nSo anyway, have you guys actually watched Kane Pixels’ rendition of The Backrooms? Amidst all the over-the-top, and downright silly imaginings some people post about in a growing Wiki of … whatever, this is the real shit.\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty terrifying right?\n\nYeah, this is the inspiration for my next album, and you can check all that out if you click that little wormhole to the left (but be warned, the music plays automatically). But, I just really wanted to kind of highlight this.\n\nBecause this stuff is made by a teenager. Someone with skill that far outclasses my own in Blender and sound design, and I’m 39 years old, still learning, still working upward. And then I see this and it’s amazing. I think I’ve watched through the entire Youtube series of videos for Kane’s Backrooms about three or four times now.\n\nI’m completely sold on whatever A24 and Kane come up with for a feature-length film involving … all of this.\n\nSpeaking of feature length films involving fandoms, horror, and sometimes games, I’m also waiting very patiently on this.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the indie hit game Iron Lung, by a Youtuber I’ve really just barely watched over the past decade. But this is really something.\n\nThe horror genre is about to be stomped into the dust with a new genre of film. While studios are remaking Halloween 47 times, we’ve got two Youtubers stretching the bounds of imagination with things Hollywood couldn’t even remotely dream of.\n\nI only hope that both Backrooms and Iron Lung are successes so that this continues.\n"

This also came with shutting down [REVOSA]’s in-world presence completely.\n\nThat … was a week ago.\n\nNow it’s Sunday, August 25th, and as I was looking for options, some kind of option, to keep [REVOSA] online within the virtual world, I nabbed a very tiny 512sqm spot, and began to build.\n\nWhile I was doing this, I got a direct message from someone who’d been watching what was going on in the Second Life [REVOSA] group, and … he offered me a sizable plot on a full sim with access to 1000 land impact.\n\nThis is about what I was using at Neo Machina before I decided it needed to be shutdown.\n\nIf you see Logan Bamaisin (Laufiair Hexicola) in-world at the space station, make sure you give him a hello and a thank you for keeping [REVOSA] not only online, but also in the kind of space it deserves, being almost ten years olds, at this point.\n\nYou can check out the brand new store location, here.\n\nThat’s all I’ve got for now, it’s time to get building!\n\n\n"

    "content": "It’s time for the tri-monthly update on the Mastodon instance I run, mkultra.monster (no, it’s not hosted on this website or its server, but it is using the same domain)! Queue me trying to figure out if it really has been three months since I posted anything about my instance.\n\nIn the past year, thus far, I’ve written an ActivityPub guide on choosing instances, and software (so that people can more easily escape Twitter), and I’ve provided a list of instances safe for queer users, and sex workers (found at the top of my AP guide), my instance, obviously being one of them.\n\nSo, today, like I did a few months back, I just want to write about my instance, and other topics involving the fediverse.\n\nCurrently, I am still the admin, and in good news, my car repairs won’t cost as much as they were originally projected to (about 300 dollars less than quoted), so any thoughts of ever having to shutdown the instance are gone.\n\nAs of posting this, the instance is mostly home to just me, with six other people whom have either signed up, posted for a while, and moved on, or signed up and then never posted anything. Which is fine! Some people like to have a backup at-hand, and some people like to test waters. These accounts will remain as long as they don’t ever break any of the rules.\n\nSpeaking of rules, mkultra.monster is still very much staunchly anti-AI, and all use of theft-machines on the local and federated timelines are an immediate ban without question, or chances given. This includes AI-posting coming from Threads.net. I’ve chosen to keep Threads federating based on the assumption, or idea, that I could potentially goad people I know, or friends who are on there, into joining Mastodon … whenever Threads decides to finally finish the deal and make it so people on the Threads-side can actually see posts from Mastodon, organically.\n\nWhich, for all intents and purposes, could end up never happening, especially with Project 2025 author and Heritage Foundation member, Dustin Carmack as the public policy advisor for the Southern sectors at Meta. And if that ends up being the case, I will eventually throw a full and hard block at Threads.\n\nI understand this is a deal-breaker for some, but unlike a few other instances and their admins out there, I’m not always an all-or-nothing, black-and-white type of thinker, and I’ll never build a blacklist that openly displays information that’s been scraped from the entire fediverse, that nobody asked permission for. Unless we’re talking about AI, or nazis (which, funnily enough, sometimes go hand-in-hand, which totally couldn’t be correlated with the fascist mindset revolving around the destruction of the arts and their institutions).\n\nAs for the instance, if you join, I currently have no moderators working under me, it’s a one-person show. In that same light, if you sign up and you see objectionable content, or things you don’t like, feel free to report them. Sometimes I can answer immediately, sometimes I can’t. But all reports are eventually handled, and within as little time as I can manage (while having a full-time offline job).\n\nAs stated on other pages, and in other posts, mkultra.monster is explicitly an LGBTQ+/Queer safe instance, and absolutely safe for sex workers (as long as proper content warnings are used). This hasn’t and will not ever change.\n\nCurrently the user limit is 500, and that’s definitely more than enough space for you, and your pals.\n\nOr, we can just keep running this show solo. Doesn’t bother me either way. I originally erected this instance based on the necessity of wanting to be on the fediverse, but not wanting to deal with overzealous, power-tripping admins who will ban someone responding to a troll, rather than the troll. But hackers.town, cybre.space, and the others I can’t even remember the names of anymore, have had enough angst from me, even if one of them still harbors my account, and all the posts I made over the course of half a decade.\n\nAnyway!\n\nThat’s the beauty of the fediverse though, it’s run by the people, and nobody else. It’s a shame that sometimes that’s not a good thing, but by and large, it is absolutely the best thing. The best thing, while corporate social media is overrun by engagement farmers who post like they sold their soul years ago, and pornbots run by … well, I’m not sure anyone knows the answer to that question, but I’m sure someone will eventually figure out the location of the server-farm harboring thousands of bots who spam you on Threads with porn links.\n\nBut, until then, come on over to Mastodon, friends!\n\n"

    "content": "\n\nIt’s been a long year. Maintaining my sim in Second Life, deciding to take it down a few times when I feared I couldn’t support the costs anymore, and bringing it back each time. Switching positions in my job, and then subsequently dealing with a nonstop cycle of random shifts in the mornings, middle of the day, and the evenings. And then, most recently, my car needed nearly 2000 USD worth of repairs (costs came down once the repairs were actually done, and I paid around 1400 total). It was because of this, that I had to take my sim/city down, once and for all. 100 to 130 dollars a month to maintain something like this is just too much when having to pay for very expensive charges in real life.\n\nAt the ass-end of this, I did remove my store from within Second Life completely … for a week. Feeling heavily demoralized, I resolved to quit all of Second Life. I explored VR Chat, found a cool avatar and called it my own. But one thing really stuck out to me as an issue in VR Chat … There are adults, sure, but there are far too many children. And I don’t just mean, “Hey, there are kids here.” I mean, there are kids, running around, screaming, shouting slurs, threatening people, or, less on the side of their own faults, being subjected to semi or completely not-safe-for-work content: Doing all of this, while their parents are … nowhere to be found.\n\nI can’t stop thinking of VR Chat as a daycare center for neglected children.\n\nAnd it gives me the ick. Despite there being a semi-prominent adult population in VRC, and having had nice interactions with them. I may keep visiting the virtual world, but the company behind this app, uh, they got some things to answer for, and/or work to do.\n\nAfter a week of all of that, I sat down and realized that, despite this all being virtual, none of it being a real tangible thing in real life … I’ve put nearly ten years of work into my Second Life store, and just dropping it on a dime, and letting go of it didn’t sit right with me. So I jumped back in, I fashioned myself a brand new avatar based on the one I began Second Life with, and then I snatched up a very small parcel within my budget to re-build my store.\n\nIn the midst of this, someone within the [REVOSA] store group saw what I was doing, sent me a message, and brought me to his full sim, and handed me 1000 land impact to work with, completely free of charge. This was already detailed a few posts ago on this site, but I am very grateful.\n\nTo commemorate my store being quickly revived, I’m putting out a brand new set of shorts for the Nano Nexus line: The McFly Edition! Fit for Maitreya, Legacy, and Reborn, these shorts come in a holographic coloring not at all unlike a hat Marty might have worn in Back to the Future 2.\n\nYou can see it here, on the marketplace, or visit [REVOSA]’s brand new location and mingle while you try a demo.\n\nI am, again, very grateful that my store gets to stay in-world, and I look forward to actually making new things on a possibly consistent basis!\n"

    "content": "This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion, but: I really don’t like “hero shooters”, especially as live-service games. From Overwatch, to whatever that failed hero-shooter was at Amazon (I forget the name), to Concord, and Deadlock. There’s just, to me, absolutely nothing fun about having to fight with other people to choose the character you want to play (everything does in fact not have to be a MOBA!), and then also compete in linear game-styles against other players where you’re doing less shooting and racking up kills, and more … escorting payloads and camping on a point.\n\nIt’s obvious I should say that Team Fortress 2 was, of course, fun. But, I was also playing Team Fortress when it was a mod for Quake 2 in the nineties, long before Valve acquired it. And even despite TF2 being a fun game in the very least, I still never, never, ever, enjoyed the MOBA-like system of having to choose a hero to play (although TF2 is less restrictive with this feature) before some other player takes it from you.\n\nAnd I’m not really saying, “Call of Duty is the only way.” I actually abhor Call of Duty, because it’s completely responsible for turning casual, fun, arena style shooters into a place for sweaty streamers to try and prove themselves to viewers and sponsors for fast cash.\n\nAs with all things, money ruins everything.\n\nLet me say this, though. Overwatch was fun in the first year, and then, just like with Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard lost all of their steam, and they appear to just be supporting the game behind the curtain, and it’s become a game that takes a backseat to everything else. It doesn’t feel exciting, or fun to log into. And, despite the hero system being a little less restrictive, a little less, “Whoops, JohnnyEZ took that hero, you gotta play something else!”, it just feels … uninspired to jump into. Uninspired and burned out, like a lot of the stuff Blizzard puts out nowadays. I haven’t tried out War Within yet, but even World of Warcraft feels like it’s far beyond its expiration date.\n\nSo, imagine my surprise, when I’m hearing about this new game from Valve. A new game that for sure definitely isn’t a number three in a franchise that … I don’t even personally think was all that amazing (we’re talking Halfife), but some kind of brand, new IP?\n\nShoot, let me get an invite!\n\nAnd an invite I got.\n\nAnd a download I did.\n\nAnd then I logged on.\n\nOh.\n\nAnother live-service, hero-shooter.\n\nI don’t know where these game developers are getting their stats about these types of games, but in the social circles I inhabit online, absolutely nobody is talking about playing or enjoying games like this. It’s my assumption, and/or feeling, that people are tired of this type of game. Like, no, uh, I don’t want to play a forever game with three modes, restrictive hero-selection, and loot boxes.\n\nI wanna play Silent Hill 2, Dwarf Fortress, Elden Ring (although, on Linux, I haven’t been able to play online for months due to not buying their latest DLC), and Death Stranding.\n\nI want more games that are singular experiences, with optional online features. Like in super-popular GACHA style Zelda-like, Genshin Impact, I can roam the entire world and do whatever I want without spending a dime, and then I can interact with other players, if I feel like it. Or, if you also hate the concept of an always-online GACHA, how about No Man’s Sky!\n\nI dunno, though. This is just one person’s opinion. The opinion of someone who felt Halfife was good enough, but definitely not a cultural phenomenon, and Team Fortress 2, while fun, was and still is definitely overrated. A Linux-gamer who can’t even play Call of Duty, even if I wanted to, and the closest things that I have to a fun arena-shooter are Quake Champions and Combat Master.\n\nI’m just gonna go play some Warframe.\n\n"

    "content": "\n\nEveryone’s heard of Tumblr. Most know it for its 2010s fandoms, and sometimes extreme politics. Others know Tumblr for “that place that banned porn, which caused a huge influx of those same fandom loving people to suddenly invade Twitter.” And then Twitter got bought out by a megalomaniac, and then a trans woman made a joke about exploding hammers to the CEO of Tumblr (This isn’t to say that death threats should be taken lightly, or are never serious, but after reading this I find it hard to even see this as as death threat. Wishing someone were dead, albeit bad, and not something I would personally do, doesn’t a death threat make.), and then trans people started getting banned on Tumblr, ad infinitum.\n\nSuddenly, we’re at a crossroads, where that same CEO says, “Ay, we’re movin’ it to Wordpress.com”, because they’ve tried so many things to revitalize the platform. Except for … just simply reversing the changes made all those years ago that caused people to leave. It wasn’t just “banning porn”, though. They were really attempting to target CSAM, but in the cluster of gunfire, they took out completely innocent blogs, or people who were expressing their adult rights to, well, enjoy some naked stuff of a totally legal nature.\n\nAs of writing this, there is still porn on Tumblr.\n\nIt’s not to say that porn was the only reason Tumblr was ever good, or popular, though. But once they started targeting their own users, they never stopped. On the corporate internet, LGBTQ+ people are targeted regularly. On Twitter, on Threads, on Fartbook, on Tumblr, and so on. It can be hard to find a place to really call a digital home. Which is why a lot of people have fled to the ActivityPub federated Tumblr clone, Wafrn. And, while it still may be in its infancy, or working through development, it is a far better bet for those of the LGBTQ+ persuasion who are tired of being harassed, targeted, and banned literally everywhere a corporation touches.\n\nPeople deserve to be able to express themselves freely, online, without being made out to be pariahs for their mere existence. Obviously, when I say “express themselves freely” I don’t mean that, people should be able to say slurs and abhorrent things without question or consequences. It you feel the need for a social network where you are allowed to do those things, you don’t need social media, you need therapy.\n\nIs a move to Wordpress.com going to change anything for Tumblr? I don’t know, maybe? If they finally turn on fediverse integration, it could help. But, knowing the CEO is a thin-skinned whiner, I just don’t feel confident about that.\n"

    "content": "It’s hard to believe I built a city in Second Life, and spent months, and months, and months putting together one of my biggest projects, ever. And then it stood for a year and eight months. It was my virtual home, my little piece of metaverse space with which I could do whatever I pleased. It wasn’t just some copy of the older version of Neo Machina that was built by someone else, it was it’s own thing. And I enjoyed spending time in it.\n\nNo, it never really garnered some kind of massive community. Truth be told, I have all of the energy in the world for creating, and making, but almost none of the energy for spending hours, and days trying to entice people to gather, and communicate. It’s just not my forte. And, I guess, in a way, that’s partly the reason it’s gotta close.\n\nBut really, the biggest reason is because Linden Labs charges 100-200 dollars a month for a personal “server”, and then you foot that bill. Willingly. No matter what happens. Meanwhile, you can jump into Minecraft and get yourself a server for like nine bucks a month. I’m not sure I understand the massive price difference, or what it takes to … host digital items on piece of a server that people occupy by connecting, and mostly AFK-ing. I really don’t get it.\n\nI think it’s a matter of just, a company deciding how much they think a service is worth, and then hiking the prices up so that it’s almost out of reach to people who aren’t swimming in cash.\n\nI apologize to the people who did congregate and live there, though, you know, to get back on topic. Maybe there are other places similar enough, and you can find what you’re looking for there, instead. I said in the Discord and within the Second Life group: Anyone who currently has time running on rentals within Neo Machina can be reimbursed. All you’ve got to do is contact me (my SL avatar is Nova Ayashi).\n\nI dunno, though. It sucks to see something you poured so much work into maybe actually going away for good. Sure, I’ll recover from the financial losses I went through with my car, and things will be relatively normal again. But, can I really convince myself to pick up 100 dollars a month, for the umpteenth time?\n\nYeah, I shut Neo Machina down a few times, and then brought it back up. This wasn’t some show of erratic indecision, but just solely based on … money troubles. Having troubles, deciding it’s best to fix some of that by not paying Linden Labs 100 bucks a month, and then deciding that I couldn’t let it go. But I think now is probably time to do just that.\n\nI still have a store in Second Life, and now it has a location that’s completely free of charge, and full of space. And it also has a small, secret, back-up location, just in case. So there’s that. And my store has always been the most important part of my time in Second Life. It’s just that … owning my own sim (server) in SL, was like, one of my digital dreams, and it looks like after the shutdown on September 1st, I might have to find another way to accomplish that dream.\n\nUnless I find completely different work that pays a bit more than what I’m making now, or someone decides to sign up on my Ko-fi for like a hundred bucks a month (lol).\n\nEither way, I’ll miss Neo Machina, even if it wasn’t really a hugely popular spot that hundreds of people visited daily (I don’t have the resources to build a massive RP zone with intricate systems hosted on servers outside of the virtual world).\n\nUntil next time … maybe?\n"

    "content": "I shouldn’t even really ask the question, “Is today blog day?” Because the day has passed us by. It is now 11pm. So, if today was a blog day, I’ve mostly missed it, but that’s only because I was at work the whole time. Though, I did look at some sources to see if it really is, or was, blog day, on this here August 31st, and the results are … confusing?\n\nSo, January 17th is sometimes known as National Blogging Day, August 31st is also celebrated as Blog Day, and then September 19th is International Blog Day.\n\nWhether it is, or not, I think it’s neat to celebrate “blogging.”\n\nFor a long period of time in the era of Twitter, I feel like the internet almost lost the idea of blogs and websites. In that respect, maybe Elon Musk did us all a favor, by reminding people that their thoughts and their lives don’t have to exist and revolve around one website. You can make a website, you can call it your own, and you can have it look any way you want, and you can write on it. And you should.\n\nI talk about this in my “Why” slash page, but, I mean, it’s true?\n\nSo you’re on Threads now, or Bluesky, or Mastodon. What if Threads shuts its doors? What if the devs behind Bluesky run out of resources and they go offline? What if your Mastodon instance goes down and you don’t notice until months later? This actually happened to me. I signed up on Mastodon.lol and made a bunch of posts, gained a ton of followers … and then I had my little relapse back to Twitter for a while. When things started exploding, and the Musk took over, I was like … Well, maybe I should go back to Mastodon, again.\n\nLittle did I know, the admin shutdown the entire site, but … left the domain up. They left the domain up so that they could serve people coming to find their accounts, a gif expressing being mad, or irritated.\n\nThat’s great man. But I want my data?\n\nNevertheless, I eventually launched my own Mastodon instance, and despite having no plans to close it ever (unless by unfortunate circumstance), I still think it’s a good idea to have your own website, and your own blog. Why?\n\nMastodon is not held up by infinite resources. Your posts will most likely go away at some point (databases automatically clean things up to make space). The same goes for Nostr, the same goes for Bluesky, I’m willing to bet. Although, Bluesky isn’t exactly traditionally decentralized, but people like to say that it is (this is a topic I’ve touched on a few times). And Threads? I mean, for all intents and purposes, it’ll probably be there forever.\n\nBut the other thing about traditional social media? You post something, heck, something really good, something that gets a lot of attention, and likes … And then a day later it’s gone. Forgotten about. Lost in the code, like tears in the rain.\n\nOn a website, though, you make a decent post that people enjoy, and guess what? It’s not lost in the sauce. It’s still right there. And with resources like Neocities and Github, you can host a site, for free without any threat of ever losing anything, because you can keep it all on your hdd, or your favorite cloud service. Back it up to a thumb drive, burn it to thirty CDs (they must be cheap these days, right?), get yourself a floppy drive and put it on some plastic disks. With a website, and a personal blog, your data remains in your own hands. And that’s what Geocities got right in the nineties.\n\nCorporations wanted to take this from you. They want your data in their hands. Your thoughts, your posts, your ideas, your dreams, all of it, on their own service, where they can use it at will, and sell it. That is eventually what the basis of Twitter became, and it is mostly the basis of every other corporate-owned and backed social media website, save Mastodon. No, I don’t think Bluesky ultimately has your best interest in mind. I mean, do I have to link to the article I wrote for a third time about their partnership with a company that’s using OpenAI tech in their software?\n\nSure, this all isn’t something that swaths of people care about. You can go on any of these sites right now and see people never having a single thought about their personal data ownership and privacy.\n\nBut for those who do think about these things, and care about them, you should have a website, a personal blog. You should have these things, because it’s not enough to setup shop on Threads and put all of your trust into Meta. You absolutely should not do that.\n\nThose are my thoughts for this particular Blog Day, though. Get away from Twitter, and rebuild, rethink how you use the internet.\n"

Just exactly how much influence this living turd has on Threads is questionable. For all I know it could only be Facebook (judging by the way Facebook looks nowadays).\n  It’s algorithm is like a drunk person having mood swings, in that, if you even so much as slightly interact with a topic, that’s the only thing you see for the entire next day.\n  And that there are groups of instances on the Fediverse extremely dedicated to not only blocking federation from Threads themselves, but essentially utilizing peer pressure as a weapon in order to get others to do so, as well.\n\n\nOn that last point, though, I’ve spoken about the little “black list” built by veganism.social that basically lists every federated server they can see, and whether or not they’re blocking Threads (again, peer pressure, and I wish people would stop acting like we’re all mentally still in high school).

Have your opinion, your feelings, and what you think is right, and stop forcing it onto other people, unless of course we’re talking discrimination, hate crimes, or what-have-you … I mean, obviously, you should make sure people know those things are bad.\n\nBut Threads?\n\nRight now I’m seeing it as kind of a gray area.\n\nThere are people on there I haven’t seen in years, that I was originally following on Twitter. Tons of LGBTQ+ people, and other people I wouldn’t ever call “bad”. And then, you know, the trolls, weirdos, and one-off accounts, and oh yeah, also, the spam accounts intentionally setup to grift engagement.\n\nThat’s not what I’m writing this post about, today, though.\n\nToday it’s about the ethos of “embrace, extend, extinguish” that all started with Google and XMPP. Basically, Google integrated its instant messaging protocol with XMPP, and then decided, like they do with every project that isn’t an immediate groundbreaking successful thing, and backed out. The problem with this, is that Google’s integration was highly anticipated, and this drew a lot more people to XMPP, and then this also essentially “killed it.” I don’t really know if you can say it’s dead, though, because I literally can see people linking to their own usernames for XMPP on their Mastodon profiles, right now, as I’m typing this.\n\nThe fear revolving around Threads and federation with ActivityPub, is … uhm, that people might get too excited about this, and everyone might federate with Threads, and then Threads might pull out and extinguish interest in ActivityPub. That, and Meta isn’t so great at moderating Threads. But … I don’t really see how that’s a problem for Mastodon, when as admins and moderators, you can manually silence bad accounts, and you should, regardless of where they’re coming from. An interesting thing I’ve seen on Wafrn, though, is that the federated Tumblr alternative makes federating with Threads an account-level, opt-in, and I think that’s actually really genius. The decision should absolutely be in the hands of the user.\n\nBut I have some opinions on XMPP and its eventual perceived crash, and whether Meta is copy/pasting what Google did here.\n\nFirst of all, as much as I loved Aol Instant Messenger, and instant messaging in the nineties … it’s dead, guys. I don’t know about you, or anyone else, but I can hardly find enough interest in Discord and my Steam friends list to keep up with them enough to actively talk to people for long periods of time. I … kind of just use social media for that. You know, that thing that started with Myspace and only became bigger until it ruled our entire lives?\n\nNowadays, I kind of don’t really like anyone outside of my family having immediate access to me. I’m reclusive, and I’m battling things in my head that make it hard for me to break out of my own shell, and you think I’m going to go out of my way to actively talk to a bunch of people instantly and all of the time.\n\nNuh uh.\n\nYou see, I mean, sure, Google deciding to graveyard federation with XMPP likely harmed it, even if just a little bit. But I think the overarching problem here is just that, instant messaging isn’t really the thing nowadays, and I think it’s always kind of been on the way out.\n\nSocial media, micro-blogging, you think that’d go away on the fediverse on the off-chance that Meta kills Threads, or pulls out of ActivityPub?\n\nAP’s been around since the early 2000s, and yeah, sure, it has this reputation of being a Linux-user’s heaven, and full of dudes who hate people who make things (like music, art, etc), but I don’t think it’s ever going anywhere. At this point, Twitter is basically the only major platform that isn’t federated, or touting decentralization, and it’s dying.\n\nBut even in the off-chance that Meta does a select-all and delete on its ActivityPub integration, I think apps like Mastodon would definitely still be standing. Because, as of writing this, plenty of people aren’t even federating with Threads, and most of the people I see and interact with on the fediverse value a user-owned social network more than anything else on the web. Whether Threads is there or not, for many, is purely inconsequential in the grander scheme of things. And a lot of users on Threads don’t even know what the hell Mastodon even is.\n\n\n      Post by @thebrianpenny  View on Threads\n\n\n\nI don’t think I have to, but I just want to point out real quick that Mastodon is not a company, and ActivityPub, or, “the fediverse”, as stated before, has existed for decades. That the Bluesky devs suddenly, just two days ago, decided to call the network of keys accessing their servers “the atmosphere” is more or less just another way I feel they’re kind of cherry-picking ideas from a concept that has existed well before they decided they wanted to be Twitter 2.0.\n\n\nWe talk about Bluesky getting users, but Bluesky is part of an open social internet called \"The Atmosphere\" where other people can make their own apps, including their own versions of Bluesky.\n\nBluesky isn't growing; the Atmosphere is! You're not \"our\" users; you're a part of a shared place.— Paul Frazee (@pfrazee.com) Aug 31, 2024 at 8:43 PM\n\n\nBut anyway .. embrace, extend, extinguish, or just fear-mongering, with some legit concerns about corporations, and their goals?\n\nYou decide, I suppose.\n\nA lot of what I say about some of these networks might sound negative, or pessimistic, but I really do actually enjoy watching it all shift back and forth. I like that the internet is having a power-struggle to figure out where the “place to be” is now. Because none of them will win. The “place to be” is wherever you want, and it should’ve never been just one website, like I sad in my “blog day” post.\n"

    "url": "/tech/2024/09/02/nanowrimo-weaponizes-social-justice-language-in-endorsement-of-ai.html",
    "content": "It’s the second day of my little tiny vacation, and I’ve woken up at the bright and early hour of 11 in the morning. I log onto social media to check my notifications and see what’s happening, and … I’m immediately alerted that those behind NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) have endorsed using theft-machines (AI) to generate books and stories, while weaponizing social justice language in order to emotionally manipulate their readers and writers.\n\n404 Media wrote a fairly neutral article on the matter that doesn’t appear to take any position whatsoever, but I’m linking them here anyway, in order to contextualize who NaNoWriMo was, and is.\n\n\n  NaNoWriMo started as a group writing project in the ‘90s with the goal of writing a 50,000-word manuscript in one month (November), but in 2005, NaNoWriMo became a nonprofit organization that takes donations and runs fundraising campaigns.\n\n\nBut, let’s now take a look at their reasoning, and then tear those reasons to shreds. I’ll be calling NaNoWriMo “NNW” from here on out in this post, just because it’s easier to type than an abbreviation with annoying capitalization.\n\nNNW says that condemning AI in writing is classist:\n\n\n  Not all writers have the financial ability to hire humans to help at certain phases of their writing. For some writers, the decision to use AI is a practical, not an ideological, one. The financial ability to engage a human for feedback and review assumes a level of privilege that not all community members possess.\n\n\nIt’s true that, as writers and authors who don’t have access to thousands of dollars, it can be a hard time getting outside opinions and help on your writing. But, here’s the thing: You can still write a story, or a novel, without using machines that rip off other authors in order to edit and proofread (if you can call feeding your work into an LLM “editing” and “proofreading”). As an independent author, myself, I have friends, and sometimes I’ll conscript them to give me some opinions on what I’ve written. I also extensively comb over my writing (now, at least) when I’m putting a book together. Hence the reason it’s been taking me well over a year to make progress on my next book, Dissolution Protocol. I want to make something really good.\n\nAnd it takes a lot of practice, and time, to become effective at spotting errors and issues in your own writing.\n\nBut here’s the thing: That’s fine! What’s the rush? The act of creating art is and always has been a slow-burn process of practicing, learning, and both failure and success. There’s nothing wrong with that! That’s how art is! And introducing AI into the matter cuts that out completely. All of it.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention all of the other resources available to independent writers and authors. Join a discussion forum of writers and readers! Post snippets! There are so many online avenues you can use to find help with your writing that don’t cost you a dime, and you don’t have to rip off anyone in order to utilize them.\n\nNNW also says that condemning AI in writing is ableist:\n\n\n  Not all brains have same abilities and not all writers function at the same level of education or proficiency in the language in which they are writing. Some brains and ability levels require outside help or accommodations to achieve certain goals. The notion that all writers “should“ be able to perform certain functions independently or is a position that we disagree with wholeheartedly. There is a wealth of reasons why individuals can’t “see” the issues in their writing without help.\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is the part where they get real manipulative, because now we’re using disabled people as our reason for saying it’s totally fine to use these planet-destroying bots to write for you (LLMs are more and more increasingly power hungry, so much so that Microsoft is considering building nuclear reactors to power them, and many current LLMs are burning tons and tons of fossil fuels in order to operate).\n\nYes, people sometimes need outside accommodations for reading and writing, like screen readers, and special keyboards, and, as I mentioned in my thoughts above, community forums where readers and writers collaborate together to troubleshoot their own work. Saying, “not all brains have the same abilities” in your endorsement of these machines is exactly how a psychopath would attempt to convince you that cutting off your own hand is beneficial to you, somehow.\n\nNow, to be fair, this is what they actually say right at the start of their post on Zendesk:\n\n\n  NaNoWriMo does not explicitly support any specific approach to writing, nor does it explicitly condemn any approach, including the use of AI.\n\n\nor, “We don’t explicitly support any specific approach to writing, and we don’t condemn any approach, such as AI, but also, here’s why we fully endorse using AI.”\n\nI’m gonna be real with you, chief. I have used text-based AI. I’ve used it like Google to see if it could answer questions better and faster than a Google search would. Because, despite my grievances with most LLMs, and especially the image-generation machines that are completely and entirely based on theft and disenfranchisement, I don’t think these things are going anywhere. I think there are some limited uses for text-based AI. Like, you could open up, let’s say, ChatGPT and say, “Hey, what are some writing prompts that might be interesting?” or, “What are some resources I could use to get outside opinions and help on my writing?”\n\nAnd sometimes, you do actually get decent answers. I just wouldn’t trust whatever the hell Google’s developing.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at their continued opinions in regard to general access issues:\n\n\n  All of these considerations exist within a larger system in which writers don’t always have equal access to resources along the chain. For example, underrepresented minorities are less likely to be offered traditional publishing contracts, which places some, by default, into the indie author space, which inequitably creates upfront cost burdens that authors who do not suffer from systemic discrimination may have to incur.\n\n\nSo, we’re continuing to emotionally manipulate people by, instead of using disabled people this time, we’re going to use marginalized people, such as the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nYes, yes, finding an agent is hard. Getting a contract is even harder. In the years I’ve been writing fiction (since 2008), I’ve rebuffed the idea completely. Especially after, more recently, seeing examples of literary agents openly suggesting stealing an author’s query for themselves.\n\nThe world is a vampire. A pimple-infested, gout infected, disease ridden, vampire.\n\nBut, with this further explanation of their stance, NNW speaks as though being an “indie author” is not desirable, that it’s lesser, and I couldn’t disagree more.\n\nSince I started writing, those who do have contracts, and who do have agents, have always taken to social media to speak like the privileged snobs some of them are. Saying that community-sourced editing and proofreading from authors who take to publishing themselves through avenues like Smashwords, aren’t as good, or are “lazy.” That you shouldn’t pay any attention to an author’s work, if it isn’t coming out of one of the big six.\n\nAnd, sadly, authors utilizing AI to write books for them are only going to make independent publishing that much harder, because the optics around self publishing were already dark, and muddy, partially because of the gate-keeper jerks who speak like this.\n\nYou can be an independent author, and you can write a decent story, without using machines that not only steal from other writers, but will absolutely vacuum up the work you feed into it, in order to further compound this problem. And I’m going to say that again, so that it’s clear, you should not feed your work into an LLM (an AI), unless you want it stolen from you.\n\nI can only imagine that the reason NNW has taken this stance, is because they must have suddenly received funding from some kind of Silicon Valley venture capital, right?\n\nRight?\n\nAnyway, those are the most important points I wanted to touch on in light of these, frankly, idiotic takes coming from NNW. If you’re going to endorse AI, you can at least do it without speaking to writers and readers like Hannibal-fucking-Lector, manipulating them into sitting down at the dinner table and prepping their own brain for consumption.\n\nUpdate: And here you have it, NaNoWriMo is sponsored by a company that utilizes AI.\n\n"

    "title": "So I Beat POOLS",
    "url": "/gaming/2024/09/03/so-i-beat-pools.html",
    "content": "\n\nYou remember a while back when I wrote that post on POOLS about how awesome and good I thought the game was? Well, I got to chapter two around that time, and decided to stop playing for a while. Not because the game was bad or anything, but just because it gets under you skin way too easily. Eventually, though, I had to come back, and I had to complete it.\n\nAnd that I did.\n\n\n\nI’m going to spoil a bunch of stuff here, but I’m assuming that’s okay, because Backrooms related games and media are kinda niche, and when it comes to horror, this is especially niche.\n\nUsually, when I tried to play this game, I would do it late at night, in complete silence … for some reason. And that made it pretty hard to work my way through. Don’t even get me started on The Complex: Expedition. Despite its harmless entity (that I know of), I find that game just as terrifying.\n\nIt’s all the low humming, the scratches, the howling of dark wind in an endless tunnel.\n\nBut I did it.\n\nI pushed through, with my pinky on the shift key, the entire time.\n\nThere were freaky moments. Funny moments. And sometimes, awe-inspiring moments.\n\nAnd then it came to an end, with the silent protagonist setting their camera down upon a table, mannequins encroaching upon you from one of two paths behind you, and another arm holding a door open. But then the view cuts to a recording, the door shuts, and whoever’s viewing the tape of your actions hits the stop button, and credits roll.\n\nPretty confusing, right?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nThroughout POOLS, there is a lot of imagery. It’s, of course, based on the Backrooms. And the pool rooms are a level known in the liminal maze. Some may also know it as Sublimity (you also get a glimpse of the actual Backrooms in POOLS, along with some other pieces of levels dreamed up by the fandom, such as Eternal Suburbia). The developers though, they only say it’s based on the Backrooms, and I think I understand why we’re making that distinction here. Because it is the backrooms, but it’s also something else.\n\nIt’s a work of art.\n\nIt’s purgatory.\n\n\n\nIt’s an allegory for abuse, and the victim of that abuse fighting to escape it, and failing. Fighting in isolation, and trauma, reminded at every turn what they did to you, and when there’s a light at the end of the tunnel and you think you’re finally out of the never-ending spiral, it goes out and disappears. And then the darkness pulls you back in.\n\nWhere does this inkling come from, though? Some have already said that they believe this to be an allegory for such things. That this has to be about abuse, or something. I think someone even mentioned they thought it was about CSA, due to some depictions of a child’s drawings on the walls, big black letters scrawled across a picture that reads, “NOTHING,” a single lonely house that appears to you toward the end, and then endless copies of it, and the appearance of very large mannequins screaming, viewing other mannequins in compromising, embarrassing positions, pointing, staring, mouth-agape in horror.\n\n\n\nWhatever type of abuse it is, I think this game is definitely telling a story, whether real or fiction, and it’s all right in front of you the whole time.\n\nThe innocent rubber ducks sitting around in the water that are somehow terrifying. The pool slides that seem to be in random places that beg to be jumped into, as absurd as that is, while you’re lost in a horrifying complex.\n\nThe mixture of innocence, and despair.\n\nOf lightheartedness, and terror.\n\n\n\nPOOLS takes something that really has no meaning, other than to terrify, and turns it into something that has … a very deep message. Something you have to decode yourself, or not. It’s entirely up to the player, I think. And that’s one more thing that just makes this game so good.\n\nI could be entirely wrong, though, and this could be one of many ways to interpret the game. And that’s okay. Because POOLS isn’t just a game, it’s a work of art, and it asks that you experience it. Nothing more.\n"

    "content": "I feel like this is something I want to write about here on the Nova Prime, not because it’s a joyful topic, or something that makes me happy, but because it’s an overall larger issue that I think’s been carried over from a website that’s trained a lot of people to kind of, mentally … disregard others, at all expense, for their own personal gain, or comfort. Am I saying that Twitter has accidentally spawned masses of narcissists? Not really. I don’t think a website and its use for over a decade can alter someone’s brain chemistry. Or … can it?\n\nBut this is more about Bluesky, because, yes, again, we are seeing some undue angst and toxicity being slung toward the federated social network revolving around ActivityPub, or more exclusively, Mastodon, because a lot of these people don’t know about and don’t care to discover the rest of it. I’ve seen this happen pretty much every other day since Twitter had its last excursion, and then the more recent Brazilian excursion. People, basically, celebrating what they themselves believe to be a better platform, and for all intents and purposes, they can do that (even if that platform is a corporate owned entity no better than Twitter)! But, for whatever reason, it’s always followed by also dunking on people who are minding their own business on the Fediverse. For …\n\nReasons!\n\nI want to preface this with something, before I dive into the biggest offenses I’ve seen: I was invited to join Bluesky back when the doors were still closed. Back when it was still an exclusive club, and being more familiar with Mastodon, than Bluesky, I was pretty used to … let’s say, people kinda more actually giving a shit about what they say, when they say it, and how they address others. Much to my dismay, I quickly learned that this is not the average Bluesky experience. Because I didn’t save any screenshots from when it happened, and I don’t feel like reliving every intricacy of what exactly went on, I’ll be brief, and explain as simply as possible what took place.\n\nI started following people in and adjacent to the LGBTQ+ community, and, as you know, some people like to post with complete abandon, and zero regard. A “popular” account, attached to a, then, popular block and mute list creator, used a slur to describe people like her, and people like me, openly, just right on the timeline. Feeling kind of jolted by this, and largely due-in-part to some trauma I’ve had in the past, I asked if it was completely necessary to do that. Or, if some kind of warning could’ve happened (no, I am not talking about the word “Queer”, just so we’re straight on that).\n\nThis was, apparently, not the right thing to ask.\n\nIt was my first week on Bluesky, and I was dogpiled, I was harassed, I was mocked for being traumatized by past events that I had no control over, because of who I was, and how I presented myself to the world (you know, instances of events where harm did, or could have come upon my person).\n\nI had multiple users jump directly into my notifications to make sure I knew that nobody cares about how I feel, about my feelings, and that my experiences mean nothing. That I am alone, and I have to deal with it myself, while others speak, and do as they please.\n\nAs you can probably guess, I was a mess around this point. I was kind of … reeling. Flashbacks, trauma, anxiety; Feeling like I’d just joined a social network absolutely full of sociopaths.\n\nFlash forward a year, and both of those original accounts have been pushed off of the website, because, you guessed it: They’re both abusive people that were given too much benefit of the doubt.\n\nWho could have guessed.\n\nNow: Could I have avoided all of this by just unfollowing the offending account or accounts? Sure. But also I don’t think it’s a lot to ask that people take harmful things, and put them behind a warning. Which is something that usually happens on Mastodon, because, I guess, a larger number of Mastodon users care about other people more than your average Bluesky user?\n\nI don’t know. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to generalize a whole website of people. But! Impressions were made, and set.\n\nNow, here we are today. Another gaggle of people rejoicing at the growth Bluesky is experiencing due to X being banned in Brazil. Which is good! A website that is owned and operated by a corporate entity, and sponsor, needs growth in order to eventually make money. And, like clockwork, with all of that also comes the random dunking of people who use a much older federated network, that’s been around since the internet took off. You already know what I’m talking about, so we’ll just dive right into this, again (I posted about this on my Mastodon account, but I feel like it needed more picking apart).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a lot of people who read what I write here probably already know, I’m very passionate about the deconstruction of centralized social media, and the corporate internet. So much so, that I have two machines that run Linux, one that runs MacOS, and none that run Windows. Most of my online activity is on some kind of open-source software, and the corporate tech I do interact with is … limited, and usually only for the benefit of what I create, or compose, or make.\n\nNow, I use Linux, and I am by no means a Linux genius, so when I see someone talking about compiling a Linux kernel, I’m not entirely sure how they’d accomplish that. I’ve never done it, nor ever considered it. But! I am under the impression that you need some knowledge of the C programming language, and its compilers.\n\nImagine saying that you need a degree in computer science to choose a Mastodon instance, and to make sure you’re choosing one with a competent moderation policy, and fully meaning that, wholeheartedly, with a straight face. And to say that in response to someone, basically saying that, your onboarding process for a social network needs to be entirely smooth, without friction, or people will immediately abandon it and just give their data back to their corporate overlords.\n\nI don’t want to believe that a mass majority of people are so intellectually lazy that they’d refuse to spend sixty seconds looking at the splash page of a Mastodon instance and going, “Hmm. Okay, so they ban nazis and they’re okay with gay and trans people, awesome!” I do want to believe that this is just a popular narrative among people who have little specific agendas in mind, but that’s probably too conspiracy theorist to even begin speaking about.\n\nLike I said in my Mastodon post on this topic, leaving Twitter behind is already creating friction in your social media existence. That a little more is too much, is just ridiculous. People are more happy to jump directly into the arms of another corporation, because all they have to do is write down a username and a password and then forget about it?\n\nNah, you can’t be serious, my guy.\n\nBut, this all isn’t even the biggest offense in what’s essentially a huge thread of people dunking on the fediverse, again, for no reason (I would link to it, but I honestly deactivated my mainline Bluesky account after seeing all of this and I have no interest in visiting their domain, again).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis. This freakin’ attitude again.\n\n“Other people’s feelings aren’t my problem! I don’t care about THEM?! GOD.”\n\nDo you know how difficult it is to push the “CW” button on Mastodon, and then type your post?\n\nIt’s not hard.\n\nIt’s also not hard to consider other people when you’re going about your daily life and making decisions.\n\nIt is not hard. You cannot convince me that it is.\n\nAll this continued attitude from Bluesky proves to me, is that Mastodon users … somehow care more about the people around them, than maybe your average user on Bluesky. Which is fucked up. Because the Fediverse has its own issues with nazi instances cropping up at random, and abusive people block evading, and so on, and so forth. But to think it’s a DUNK, that on Bluesky, you’re not expected to express empathy for others.\n\nGuys.\n\nGuys, I think I’m gonna barf into my shoes, and then piss my pants.\n\nI’m just utterly confused about how we’ve gotten to this point. to this crossroads, where two different websites are having fights with each other, and one of the main points of argument is that … it’s too hard to care about other people.\n\nI dunno, fellas, maybe I was right in the first paragraph.\n\nNeedless to say, I don’t really want much to do with Bluesky, and I’m sure there are perfectly normal and perfectly fine people on the website. But, for the past year this has been a trend, an attitude, that I have only seen coming from Bluesky.\n\nThat’s a red flag.\n\nA continuous, never-ending red flag, that just keeps waving and waving.\n\nI can’t wait for the “I deleted my Bluesky account today” posts that will inevitably begin cropping up across the Fediverse. Because, federated social media and the federated internet, is the future, whether Jay at BSKY wants to acknowledge it, or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay, I’m done.\n\n"

    "url": "/tech/2024/09/07/i-gave-buffer-a-shot-i-have-thoughts.html",
    "content": "A while back, I put up a post about Bluesky announcing their partnership with cross-posting company, “Buffer” (Yes, I’m aware that it’s starting to look like I have multiple topics that are an ongoing series on this website). I also detailed how this was a bad move, because Buffer is using OpenAI tech in their backend, and even though they say it’s just an option you can utilize with writing posts … based on how OpenAI has been conducting themselves, I don’t fully trust any company that thinks it’s a good idea to use their tech. Regardless, since I run a lot of different social media accounts, and I thought it could make things easier for me, like when I write blog posts, or have new music, I decided to give it a whirl!\n\nHere are my thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website itself is very well organized, you can connect your socials, and it even has a calendar that displays … everything you’ve ever posted on your connected accounts, chronologically by time and date (which … is actually pretty worrying if you don’t think they’re using that OpenAI tech ethically), and you can do a few other things. Such as, you can create a “start” page, which is just a rip of Link-tree. The downside, is that creating a Buffer version of Link-tree takes up one of your social connections.\n\nBut, how many are you allowed to connect on a free account?\n\nThree.\n\nOr, if you want a page with all your links provided by Buffer, essentially, you can connect two accounts.\n\nSo, basically, if you’re using the free Buffer plan, you may as well not even be there. If you can’t manage two accounts without the help of some software … geez, dude.\n\nOkay, but how much does it cost to upgrade to have more connections.\n\nShort answer: Way to goddang much.\n\nLong answer:\n\nYou can actually opt to start paying them fifteen dollars a month for the three accounts you’ve already connected, and have a few added features. Or, you can connect four accounts for twenty dollars, or five accounts for twenty-five dollars, or … a whopping fifty dollars for ten accounts! For a frame of reference, I have around eleven or twelve accounts I use across different networks, some alts, some not-so-much. They say, on the subscription page, that this is all “the most value for an individual creator …”\n\nAn individual creator? Paying, fifty dollars a month for ten accounts, as long as you’re paying on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBro …\n\nOkay, so obviously this has gotta be some kind of marketing that’s specifically targeting creators who are already making money from what they do online. For fifty dollars a month, if paid yearly, or sixty dollars on a monthly basis, for ten accounts, you could, instead, subscribe to Apple+ and Netflix, and have some entertainment instead. And then just manage your accounts yourself. All with the added benefit of not potentially feeding everything you’ve ever posted into some OpenAI crap.\n\nWhich, take a look at this: Are mentioned multiple times on the publishing and scheduling box.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Use AI assistant!” Also, did you want help publishing with the “AI Assistant?”\n\nBecause everyone on social media knows that using AI to generate your words totally doesn’t make you look like a completely fake tool-bag.\n\nSo, instead of using Buffer, I’ve opted to just manage the couple of accounts I use the most … myself. No, you guys aren’t getting fifteen, or twenty, or fifty dollars out of me.\n\nBut, I did really like their “start page” link aggregator. And, since they’re so hyper-vigilant about AI generated plagairism, I’m sure they won’t mind if I just … rip out the code of their link page, delete all the link trackers, place the CSS into its own file (because why the hell do you have it on the same page as the content?), rename all the modules to something humorous, enlarge the profile picture, increase the vertical size of the banner gif, change all of the colors, replace their icons with Phosphor icons, and replace their crappy static “update” section that doesn’t even serve clickable links, with … A live feed of my blog’s RSS (courtesy of Brenton Fletcher’s rss.bloople.net)\n\nSee it, here: CMDR Nova’s Linkgarden.\n\nBuffer version on the left, my version on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here’s the thing, if you really want, or need a page of all of your links that you can easily just hand to someone like a business card, you can build one yourself, or, if you really don’t have the time, or want to learn HTML and CSS, I can just make it for you. I’m actually going to put together some examples of what a “linkgarden” could look like if I made one, and gave it to someone, and provide information on free hosting. Or, hey, maybe I could set that up for people too?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nWhat I do know, is that you don’t have to pay companies continuously for something that can be made for you in a couple of hours, or that you can make yourself in a couple of hours, and then have full control over. And if you really need automated control of all of your accounts at once, I’m sure there’s a better way to do it, than paying some company that’s gone all-in on AI, six hundred dollars a mother-frikken year.\n"

    "content": "Today, I spent the equivalent of around ten hours of work (on my day off, no less), designing and developing a new kind of “side service” I wanted to offer to people who: Don’t have the time, or don’t want to learn HTML and CSS, and who want to separate themselves from corporate media, just a little bit, even if it’s just to stop paying services like Linktree a monthly fee.\n\nSo, today I am unveiling, LinkGarden.\n\nPlant your own garden … of links!\n\n\n\nI detail the service on the page, but I’ll write about it here, as well, except, maybe in a more extended fashion. I’m offering this for eighty bucks. You pay me, then contact me, and I’ll get your page together, and even make you a Neocities where it can be hosted (hosted, completely for free). Of course, once I hand over the credentials, you’ll be responsible for changing your password. But, that’s a given!\n\nYou can request to use a custom domain, but this is a little more involved, in that, we’ll need to figure out if you’re buying the domain, and if you know how to setup the DNS. If not, I certainly know how to do this, but I also don’t have access to your domain admin panels.\n\nI’m doing this, though, because, I want to show people that they can have all the frills of a Linktree, without a Linktree. I can do it for you, easy-peasy, and in about an hour.\n\nNow, obviously, if you want really extensive, or more complicated stuff (more javascript, animated buttons that do more than just click and highlight, and so on and so forth), that would obviously take more than an hour to setup. Then, yes, we’ll have to negotiate pricing a little bit (right now my day job takes up so much of my time it’s ridiculous). Consider this though, if you currently pay monthly for a Linktree, or some other such service, and you’ve been doing so for a long time, how much have you paid them, in total? Probably less than what it’d cost for me to do this for you, right?\n\nBut I’m also doing this, because you should own your own piece of the internet. A place where a bunch of suits aren’t tracking your every move, where people can come and see what you’re all about, quickly, and easily. Maybe sometime in the future I’ll offer to build people entire websites! But, I don’t think that’s a venture I want to spend another ten hours preparing right now (I have some people in VR I want to visit tonight).\n\nOnce you have the page, and access to it, if you decide you want things changed, I can also do that. But, I would encourage buyers to look into the code used to build their link pages, and see if you can fiddle with changing things yourself (learning is fun!). I have them all setup with the simplest CSS and HTML possible, and if you use a program like VS Code, switching colors around in a CSS file is even easier. And, if you mess things up, I will have a backup of everything I do right here on my PC.\n\nSo, come on over, and plant your own garden.\n"

    "content": "\n\nYesterday, on September 9th, 2024, it came across my timelines that Cohost, one of the few Tumblr alternatives, would be shutting its doors at the end of the year, and going read-only on October 1st. I’ve been a huge advocate that people join and use Wafrn as a Tumblr alternative, largely due-in-part to the fact that Wafrn is fediverse connected, and therefore a lot of the stress of server costs are offloaded into that connection. Not only that, but should Wafrn ever close its doors, every single user is fine, since you can just move to another fediverse server, with most of your data in-tact. Despite all of that, it is sad to see something that was pretty cool, go away.\n\nSince the beginning they’ve been proponents of … an isolated social experience, dressed up to look like a website from 1997. Which is cool (the part about looking like it’s from the nineties)! But, like I keep saying in every other post, federated social media controlled by users, and not corporations, is the future. Being regular people who aren’t a corporation who happened to get together as a group of 4, in order to develop a social media website, is pretty neat. I’ll give them that.\n\nBut, since the general vibe of Cohost has been to avoid federation, at all costs, and keep users within this walled-garden of sorts … well, I guess all that community building is also finished.\n\nI’m not trying to rub salt in the wounds of people who are upset about this. Cohost was genuinely good. It definitely wasn’t Bluesky, which, since launching, has been nothing but a monster in the room that says and does questionable things, while other people pretend it’s the only choice. And, I actually really wanted to like and use Cohost, but I’m so tied in on federation, that it just made no sense at all to me to really take serious. Just like with SpaceHey, the Myspace revival project … I don’t really have any interest in sharing my thoughts, ideas, and projects on an isolated website, in 2024, just so I can also go share it on the website that isn’t isolated.\n\nReducing repetitive action is necessary, because, if you’re a creator, you do stuff like this a lot, and time isn’t cheap, and I don’t have a lot of it nowadays.\n\nBut, for people who are just online to share thoughts, and didn’t really have any other place they posted them in, I’m sorry. I wish I had a million dollars or two in order to save this website. It really does suck a lot to see the good ones go, when the bad places are still up and running and have yet to die (TWITTER!).\n\nAs an alternative action for those who I’ve seen via Cohost talking about how it was, to them, the only safe place online they felt they could express themselves, I urge you to create a website here on Neocities. It doesn’t even have to be professionally designed or perfect, but just make a website. Design it any way you please, and set it up in a way that allows you to speak. I think you’ll find that being able to share you thoughts on something you built, for free, and without threat of any servers dying is pretty fun. And, at the end of the day, everything you create for a website should be backed up on your PC, effectively making it impossible for your data to be destroyed (I also back up my websites in multiple cloud locations, just in case).\n\nThose are my thoughts, though, aside from being confused at how Stripe’s policy change on tipping caused all of this. Surely, you could still offer a site-wide currency in order to generate revenue, and just give people who buy it some kind of fake little digital thing for their blogs so that it’s no longer a payment for what Stripe essentially sees as nothing. I don’t know, maybe the problem runs deeper than that.\n"

    "content": "It was 2020, my rotation of mobile games included just two of them. I had a phone that could support … maybe three? One of them was the already very well-known Orc game, and the other was a little gacha called Illusion Connect. Okay, so, if you aren’t really interested in gachas, and you think buying stuff in them sucks, this probably isn’t all that interesting to you.\n\nBut, today it was revealed, that almost two years after it’s closure, Illusion Connect is returning this winter.\n\n\n\nThis was my main mobile game for a long time. The thing is, like with most mobile games, I stop playing them for a while, and then I come back and continue. It’s a pattern with me, and not really any inherent issue with mobile games in-general. I treat triple-a desktop games exactly the same way. I’m super into Warframe, but I haven’t opened it in two weeks, because I just … have so much going on in my brain-juice.\n\nSo I had that little cooling off period, and after a while, I decided I wanted to open it up again and see how things were going. And then in December, 2022, it abruptly shutdown. Leaving you with nothing but an error screen as if it still exists, it just couldn’t connect to the servers.\n\nSince then, I’ve been kind of meandering through these other gacha games that don’t really capture the same thing, or the same fun I had in my little phone game of anime girls. Albeit, Genshin, ZZZ, Wuthering Waves are all great. There’s just … something also good about a game that isn’t trying to be a huge open-world mega gacha experience. And that’s what Illusion Connect was. A simple thing you logged into, tapped some objectives, collected your stuff, pulled, and then logged off.\n\nI like mobile games like that. Something I can open secretly while I’m walking through the halls at work, click a box, watch it open, and then shove my phone back into my pants.\n\nBut anyway, here’s the announcement.\n\nFor those who can’t read Chinese, (like me), here’s the translation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffice to say, the developers have apparently been rebuilding the game, and that’s cool! It’s cool when an online game of sorts isn’t just abandoned, and instead worked on, rebuilt, and then relaunched, even after an unfortunate closure. A lot of big studios should take notes here …\n\nStill mad I bought into The Matrix Online two decades ago in order to lose all my stuff, and my character, forever.\n"

    "content": "Today I woke up sprawled out on my couch because I once again passed out while watching Youtube. This is a new trend for me as I inch closer and closer to 40. But, I got up, slapped some food into a bowl for my cat, and then turned on the milquetoast social media, and immediately saw more aggravating takes from people who don’t deserve attention, or any money whatsoever. I’m talking about plagiarists who are desperate to be called authors; AI loving losers who think you should definitely expel energy to read things they didn’t even have the energy to write themselves.\n\nThis comes on the heel of more irritating news, as Mozilla ignores thousands and thousands of their users criticizing their implementation of AI into Firefox (for no verifiable reason whatsoever), because obviously they’re more interested in the destruction of Mozilla, than continuing to be a privacy focused company. I have since moved to Vivaldi, a browser by a company that has pledged not to implement AI into their browser.\n\nBut, back to the point at-hand, I want to highlight this article specifically, because I can only take so much inauthentic douchebaggery before I have to really express my thoughts. And that’s saying a lot, because most of corporate social media feeds off of being inauthentic and fake.\n\n\n      Post by @theinformation  View on Threads\n\n\n\nOpinion: Johnny Silverhand should materialize into the real world and explode AI content farms.\n\nLet’s not even talk about the Threads account of a publication that has such a basic name that it’s gotta be AI generated (we’re … THE INFORMATION), but into the article itself where the featured image, some glossy ai-generated sludge, is attributed to the same guy who’s writing about how great it is to plagiarize actual writers in order to write a book. To add insult to injury, you can’t even read his word-vomit without paying him and/or the website for a subscription. Like the desperation of a teenager right before prom, these complete hacks who think they can technology their way into being a part of the creative world, they’re dead-set determined to make money off of you, somehow, some way.\n\nSo, because the article is paywalled and I’m too groggy to sift through their code in order to delete it, we’re just going to talk about the snippet you’re allowed to see before it cuts off and demands … ah, a minimum 300 dollars per year. Yeah, no. Put me in a Saw trap in a dirty bathroom, chained to a wall with a rusty bone saw and I’d sooner remove my own foot than pay you.\n\n\n\n\n\nRipped directly from the RSS feed:\n\n\n  Tim Boucher is an artist and technologist who explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity.\n\n\n\n  I set up a Google Alert on my name so long ago that I’d almost forgotten about it. It occasionally sends me stories about people in faraway places who share my first and last names. But the alert I received in mid-August was different.\n\n\n\n  When I opened the email, I realized that this was really about me: My work had been referenced in a class action lawsuit against Anthropic, a leader in generative artificial intelligence. I am not party to the lawsuit, but it claims that my work is not real “writing” (scare quotes and all) and that I am not a real author, because I use generative AI, among other tools, to produce my books. No one involved in the lawsuit reached out to me for more information; I would have been happy to share.\n\n\n“Tim Boucher is an artist.” I wouldn’t go that far, insulting artists by giving Tim credibility. But, right from the get-go, this guy is expressing his extreme need to feel important, or like he’s done something, by immediately detailing that he’s setup Google Alerts to let him know when people have mentioned his name online. Tim Boucher, come read what I’ve written about you, you fake piece of crap.\n\nHe starts out talking about how he was essentially being sued for using AI to pump out sludge-books. And, to whomever said his writing was not real, I applaud you. You should do it again.\n\nSince that’s around where it cuts off, I’m assuming the article is less about Tim trying to feel validated in being a plagiarist hack, and more him writing a defense he’ll use in the court of law, where he’ll be forever shamed. I’m just going to use this as a jumping off point to share the rest of my feelings on this matter. A matter I wish wasn’t a matter, but we’re living in the worst and also most boring cyberpunk dystopia imaginable.\n\nThey’re right, Tim. You are not a real writer, you are not a real author, and you haven’t done anything of note.\n\nAnyone who uses theft-tech to generate words that they can publish for a quick buck is not a damn author. You are no better than Microsoft Tech Support scammers ripping off elderly people of their retirement money. You have done nothing. You did not write anything. You used a machine that has scraped the entire internet of every word an actual human has written, in order to generate a discombobulation of words that you hope someone will think is interesting.\n\nBut I’m here to say, fuck you.\n\nIt’s because of people like you that the world of self published writing will be even worse off, and will be continued to be considered lesser than big house publishing. Because of uncreative, losers, flooding the market, flooding apps with shit. Before, we were only competing with people who refuse to proofread. Now we’re competing with people who refuse to proofread, and also people who refuse to read and write.\n\nI wish I was making this up.\n\nI wish I hadn’t started writing my next book literal months before this started to become a problem. I wish I would’ve written it years ago, so that I could’ve gotten it out, and finished in an era where I could still share snippets and previews online, without needing to worry about machines taking every word and rearranging it for people who should go broke and live in the gutter.\n\nThat’s how I feel.\n\nNo-holds-barred, if you use AI to generate art and fiction, you deserve the worst. And no less than that.\n\nFortunately, like NFTs, AI is a bubble, and when it finally pops, the results will be amazing, hilarious, and great. And then the general internet will forget any of this happened three days later.\n"

    "content": "For the better part of a year, I’ve been absolutely raving about the Backrooms. A fixation on a new kind of horror that is both hugely popular, and completely under-the-radar. Something I’ve written about numerous times now, including fictional speculation, and my most recent play-through of the Backrooms inspired Steam game, POOLS: Many have their ideas about the Complex, many people put out amateur content that is in the very least, entertaining. And then Kane Pixels, every so often, drops a nuclear horror bomb that redefines the Backrooms, again.\n\n\n\nBut it’s not just the Backrooms, or the idea of it that makes it scary. It’s the liminal born horror of being in places where nothing lives. You walk through your house, you probably have hallways, and stairs. You don’t live in these spaces, but they exist, nonetheless. In the silence of the day or the night, you stand in these spaces, maybe at 2am, and you feel like it’s wrong. Maybe you don’t, maybe you do. You jump in your car at 3am and drive out on a lonely highway, and you stop at a seemingly empty gas station. Again, it probably feels … off.\n\nThat’s the liminality we’re talking here.\n\nThe Backrooms are the hallways in an empty home, the gas station late at night, the middle of nowhere on an empty road, forever.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a concept I first learned and heard of, funnily enough, on Tumblr, years ago, and this is exactly the way it was described. Except it wasn’t horror, and there were no Backrooms (that came a bit later, via a single 4chan post).\n\nA lot of random content on Youtube are cartoonish demons, and disembodied smiley faces, and then you stumble upon what I believe to be the real Backrooms. Everything ever made by Kane Pixels. The “howler,” the “bacteria”, and now, in FF3, whatever the hell that was. I think it’s speculated our new monster is a bacteria infected human, driven mad. But, unlike the other two “found footage” pieces in the evolving story that Kane’s been crafting, number three feels … too real. The distinction between the real world in the recording and 3D rendering, is completely unclear. It’s totally seamless. For a while, it seems as though all of it is a set piece that someone is actually walking through. And, for all intents and purposes, it very well could have been.\n\nAnd then our camera-wielding buddy enters a lone home surrounded by walls, and … speaks to someone connected in reality. Something not ever done in Backrooms fiction before. And not only that, the protagonist “witnesses” the man he’s speaking to, falling directly into the same place, but somewhere else. And then you get an exposition from the cameraman as he takes in his last moments, right before the battery dies.\n\nIf this is anything like the movie, Hollywood won’t know what hit ‘em.\n\nSome people call it boring walking simulation, or not even scary, and those people would be wrong. We’ve had Resident Evil, we’ve had Scream, and we’ve had The Ring. I think it’s time for the next evolution of horror. I don’t know why I say “I think it’s time,” I mean, it’s already here.\n\nJust watch it. Most of it is unnerving, most of it is freaky and unsettling. But this newest offering goes even deeper. And I definitely mean that as a pun.\n\nI find myself sometimes wondering what it would be like to suddenly break from the meandering regularity of my real life and “fall” directly into an endless labyrinth. I mean … aside from starving to death. Everyone in these found footage videos have what appears to be amazing courage. But I don’t think I could ever. I might sulk in a corner and wait, or just run and run and run until something hears me. Who knows! I don’t do well with empty and strange places where things could be following you in the dark.\n\nBut that’s my take on Kane Pixels’ Backrooms content, and the ridiculously good third found footage sequence.\n"

I’ve spent a lot of blog posts giving my own opinion on current events, or unfortunate advancements in tech that facilitate mass theft, or rolling my face on the keyboard in my Backrooms obsession. I suppose maybe sometimes it’s harder to write about myself, and what and how I’m feeling about things, because I find it hard to actually want people to know me.\n\nIt’s been over a decade and a half since I really started … “making things.” It’s been even longer since I dipped my toes into web development, and suddenly arrived at this point. It’s been just about as long that I’ve been working jobs that put money toward bills, and … I find myself wanting more.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I just wanted to be a web developer. And, in a way, or sense, I am. But it’s not my career.\n\nIt should be. I basically grew up with a keyboard in my hands. Why is this not my source of income?\n\nInstead, I throw myself around in manual labor jobs and tell people what to do, and I pray every second for my weekend, or my time away from work. Time away, so I can do what I really want to do.\n\nAnd it’s come to this point where, I look back at the time I spent in my early thirties where I kind of … was doing what I wanted to do. It just wasn’t making me any livable money. I wonder sometimes if I just didn’t try hard enough, or if I was almost there. I had a semi-popular album, and then catastrophe happened. I continue to write fiction, but at this point it’s mostly just a hobby. I run a store in Second Life, but it mainly only just barely pays for the Second Life subscription itself (even though, bringing in sales enough to do that for almost ten years within the virtual world is actually pretty impressive).\n\nI look back at that, and wish I could try again, or do it again, but now.\n\nI think I’ve realized this part of myself will never be happy until I am doing the concept of this, again, and also making a livable wage from it. For the longest time I thought I was at the end, or I thought I was as good as dead, and then everything changed and I made a whole lot of progress in life … only to wish I could go back.\n\nI’m not burned out on making music, or building websites, or writing fiction, or anything else, besides … regular life. I hate the normalcy, and my brain pushes back against it every second of the day. And I’m living two lives because of it. The person I am at work? Basically a visage that doesn’t really exist. A fake me that puts on this face that only exists for eight hours, five days a week. I’m so cut off between these two worlds that I just about completely refuse to interact with anyone I know within the building, outside of it.\n\nBut I’m rambling about these nonstop streams of thought, and I just wanted to express, mostly? That something needs to change. It’s been a while. And maybe I’ve found some change in this little virtual reality space, VR Chat. But I need a bigger change. Whether that’s a web development career, or a solid, actual relationship, that doesn’t die out in months.\n\nHeck, I dunno what it’s gonna be, but I know it’s coming.\n\nMaybe I should write a resume for once?\n"

It’s one of the largest gatherings of anti-AI force I’ve seen so far, and it was glorious.\n\nContrary to all of that, Mozilla is pulling the new and quite popular corporate response to backlash, and completely ignoring everything. Which brings us to today’s post on Mozilla making the move to shut down their Mastodon instance, completely.\n\n\n\n\n\nI screenshotted this so that it can’t be erased by Mozilla themselves, but do you see that? Do you see the entire lack of a verifiable reason as to why they’ve made this decision? Just a “Welp, goodbye. Everyone pack your bags and get out of here.”\n\nInteresting.\n\nGee, I wonder if it’s because … logging on to see thousands of people telling you that your company is making the wrong move, making bad decisions, and tossing user data and privacy concerns out the window, is just too much to handle? I don’t know. Maybe paying for AI data farms that slowly melt away the ice caps is more important to you than the 40 bucks it costs to pay a managed host to keep your instance online.\n\nThat couldn’t possibly be it, could it, Mozilla?\n\nBut, here’s the thing: If you, as a company, have made a decision, and you can’t even back up that decision in the face of people who might not like it, and said company opts to cut off discourse completely, instead, that says just one thing: Mozilla is ashamed of what they’ve done, and are doing, and they know it is indefensible.\n\n"

We all know the people behind large learning models absolutely do not know what consent is.\n\nReal quick, how to turn it off:\n\nClick “Me” at the top, then go to “Settings and Privacy,” then click the “Data Privacy” tab. I want to note how hilarious it is to have a tab called “Data Privacy” where they’re automatically taking all of your data to sell to the highest bidder, and to feed into Microsoft’s plagiarism machines. But anyway … then click, “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and then toggle that off.\n\nProblem solved!\n\nBut, honestly? Who the heck uses LinkedIn? The last time I seriously attempted to use the site as a social network, I felt like I should’ve been compensated for my time, you know, paid. I felt like I should’ve gone to work the next day and filled out a time adjustment just for logging into the Founder Zone.\n\nSurely there’s a better way to go about advertising what you can do and who you are to the world, where your thoughts can stream independently and not be Zucked up by some kind of machine that’s melting the ice caps, right?\n\nEverything you can do on LinkedIn, you can accomplish by building a portfolio, having a resume, and posting on normal social media regularly by sometimes showcasing your skills, and asking about job opportunities. This happens on the fediverse all of the time. Yes, I am once again suggesting you Join Mastodon.\n\nYou don’t need a social network where everyone is talking in customer service voice and never allowing their minds a break from work-life.\n\nAnd, I mean, for sure, it goes without saying …\n\nMicrosoft’s version of AI is pretty inescapable, despite measures I’ve taken by … using Linux on my main machine, having an iPhone (which will now have an opt-in AI feature), and shelving my Xbox. But, this website is also fed through Github in order to be built, and deployed, and I do still keep some old files on Microsoft’s cloud drive.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, you’ve already been scraped by billionaires who should have paid you for your time, energy, and data. And, maybe someday they’ll be forced to.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean you should subject yourself to LinkedIn, and allow Microsoft to take even more of your data. In the open web, I call that self harm.\n"

    "content": "Back in 2012, and I don’t even remember how I went about it, I spent enormous amounts of time scrobbling my music listening habits to Last.fm. This lasted into 2014, and I am at least semi certain I started using Spotify for this. How I did before that time … I think I must’ve been using Winamp to track things I was listening to.\n\nYes. That’s it.\n\nThen I eventually created a new account for my musical presence under Eyeshadow 2600 FM and scrobbled into the 30,000s, and, like with my original account, eventually stopped doing this, as well. I also don’t really have any interest in reviving the ES2600FM Last.fm account, but that’s more to do with the piss-poor online synthwave community than anything (bullying, harassment, stalking, black-listing, etc).\n\nNow we’ll snap into 2024, like a time machine, and I’m back at it again scrobbling on Last.fm, because it’s much simpler to do now. But, I’m mostly doing this because I found this little open source project that’s like Last.fm, but more like an entire open-web social media network of your listening habits, a Wiki that documents every song ever, and even an app you can use on your PC to submit meta-data to their database.\n\nIt’s honestly pretty wild, and I only discovered it because of a side-account I made via the Fediverse on kitsunes.club. Have I mentioned that Sharkey (a misskey fork) is really cool, and I’m half considering using it as a primary and dropping the costs of hosting my own instance (I’m still not sure about this, though, because I have to have some kind of account on a Mastodon server, if only to at least have a place to link my posts here so that I can have comments)?\n\nBut anyway, the database is at MusicBrainz, and once you’ve made an account there, you can head over to ListenBrainz, and then connect all of your music-listening apps. By doing this, you can scrobble to Last.fm, and directly to ListenBrainz, where your tastes, history, listening trends and habits all become part of this little … social network of everyone’s listening habits. It’s, again, really cool.\n\nIf you’ve gotten past all of that, and you still want more, and also have a digital music collection just sitting on your PC collecting dust, you can then grab Picard, and catalogue your collection from your hard drive directly to MusicBrainz.\n\nThe best part about all of this, is that it can be mostly entirely automatic, requiring little input from the user, depending on what you use for music.\n\nI definitely recommend anyone who regularly listens to music to give all of this a try, and also follow me on ListenBrainz! Let’s compare our musical taste!\n\nAnything that makes it feel like it’s still 2000 to 2010 internet is a-okay in my book.\n"

    "content": "For the longest time, I’ve spent most of my fediverse posting hours on the Mastodon software. It’s basically almost all I know. You know, aside from those times I launched a GNU Social instance, and then a very short-lived Pleroma instance. GNU Social is a lot like if someone made an open source Facebook, and Pleroma is okay, but it was originally made by a terrible person (not that this should stop you from doing whatever you want, with your time, and servers).\n\nThen there was Misskey. Something I never really explored all that much, because the flagship instance, based in Japan, outright bans western users from even so much as registering on the instance. I tried to look up reasons as to why this is so, and all I could really find were reactionary Americans saying, “It’s because woke bad, and Japan don’t not no like that, bro?”\n\nBut, like other pieces of fediverse/activitypub software, Misskey’s got some forks. A lot of forks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m not exactly sure why this is, but that’s the beauty of open source software. You can jack a piece of it for yourself, and then completely rework it to fit your wants and needs.\n\nEnter: Sharkey.\n\nI was trying to find a comprehensive reason as to why Misskey was forked, and then transformed into Sharkey, but mostly all I could really find was this general statement:\n\n\n  Sharkey is a Misskey fork following upstream changes when possible, with added features. Like any other ActivityPub software Sharkey can interface with the thousands of servers that form the fediverse, an interconnected social network, working in tandem with software such as Akkoma, Mastodon, Pixelfed and many more.\n\n\nWhich is fine! I’ll also note that Sharkey seems to be centered around trans-feminine users and themes, which is also cool.\n\nThe fediverse, at least on the Mastodon side, kind of has this reputation that it’s full of, and made for tech geek dude type people. Which, I’ve detailed before, was really only the case back in like, 2016. I’d say now, as in 2024, the fediverse overall is very populated by the LGBTQ+ community, and all sorts of people and walks-of-life, in-general.\n\nBut what’s it like?\n\nOh, it’s cool. It’s pretty cool.\n\n\n\n\nNames in the notification tab blurred in order to preserve privacy.\n\n\nRight away, you can see that this is a hell of a lot not like Mastodon at all. You’ve got the ability to post, of course, but you have full control over the UI, everything can be customized, trending topics update live, all of your files are able to be seen in an account-based “drive,” and did I mention you could have all the links you want on your profile page?\n\nAnd, I feel like one of the main draws of Misskey and its forks, are the many, many emoji reactions you can use on posts that readily replace the tired old fave button.\n\nSo, basically, it’s kind of like Mastodon, but it’s more fun, and heavily customizable.\n\nIn fact, I feel Misskey is really aiming for self expression, and appealing to creative types.\n\nMy dilemma, is that I like this so much that I kind of want to use it more than my own instance, and I’ve even considered halting payments on a Mastodon server, and just migrating everything I do to the Sharkey instance I’m on, because … why not!?\n\nBut, at the same time, my Mastodon instance has a really sweet domain (the same one this website uses), and I’ve been using it for about a year now. I just don’t know for sure if I want to abandon that. Even if I decided to move the domain to my own hosted Sharkey instance, I’d still lose some data in that process. Not my posts though. Every single thing I’ve ever posted on my instance is copied and backed-up in a Google drive document.\n\nWhatever I end up choosing to do with my time and my posting, you should check out Sharkey for yourself! Here are some instances to check out:\n\n\n  blahaj.zone\n  transfem.social\n  mk.absturztau.be\n  kitsunes.club\n\n\nYou can check out more instances, here, but I highly recommend investigating them before face-planting your keyboard and hitting that join button. Like with all fediverse software, it’s all run by regular people. And some regular people are … not using fediverse software for good things (I don’t want to be the reason you accidentally join a server for Nazis that everyone, their Mom, and admin have blocked, suspended, and silenced).\n\nOtherwise, thanks for reading! I look forward to exploring even more of the fediverse, eight years on!\n"

    "title": "The Social Web Foundation Launches, to Much Confusion",
    "url": "/tech/2024/09/24/the-social-web-foundation-launches-to-much-confusion.html",
    "content": "Today, kind of just completely out-of-the-blue, this thing called “The Social Web Foundation” launched. Basically, this group of companies and corporations who are banding together to throw their hats together as a supporting web to build up ActivityPub and the Fediverse. Except … It reads and feels a lot like, “We made this.”\n\nAs some may know, I’ve written about Mastodon, all of its diverse software, ActivityPub, and the Fediverse quite frequently. I even wrote a little bit of a beginner’s guide to jumping in, which also features some history. History that is entirely missing from TSWF.\n\nMy first question to all of this would be: Who exactly asked for this? The Fediverse, as mentioned in my guide, has existed since 2008, without corporate or moneyed influence.\n\nQuoted from their mission page,\n\n\n  The Fediverse cannot thrive without people building clients or running providers. And to do those things, they need money. Whether that’s advertising supported, or funded by charities and non-profits, or based on paid-for services, or affiliate revenue, we are working to find ways that companies can do well in the Fediverse.\n\n\nTo a majority of the people who populate the Fedi, we don’t care if companies are doing well across the protocol. It wasn’t built for them. And it should remain that way.\n\nYes, I run my own instance. No, I don’t make any money from it. And if I ever did, it would be entirely up to future potential users who want to support mkultra.monster. But, until then, it’s run entirely out-of-pocket, and I’m okay with that. I chose to do this, and I’m running a hosted service that caps out at a certain amount of users. And I’m also okay with that! I have no interest in running a social media platform that’s populated by one hundred million people.\n\nNow, there are a lot of companies and non-profits coming together on this page, companies, like:\n\n\n  Flipboard\n  Automattic\n  Meta\n  Ghost\n  Medium\n  IFTAS\n  Write.as\n  Fastly\n  Vivaldi\n  The BLVD\n\n\nSo, it kinda makes sense that writing platforms want to get in on ActivityPub and the Fediverse. But I feel a little uneasy about Automattic getting too involved. Their CEO is a major douche-nozzle, who once had a meltdown over a joke on Tumblr, and just recently slandered a Wordpress provider for no reason.\n\nVivaldi makes more sense to me, even though they’re a web browser provider. But, their words on the matter are actually aligned with what many people across the Fediverse believe:\n\n\n  “The Fediverse reminds us of the early days of the Web. We are competing against silos and corporate interests, using a W3C-based open standard and a distributed solution,” says Jon Von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi (@jon@vivaldi.net). “It’s great that social networking companies are supporting the Fediverse, and Vivaldi is pleased to support the Social Web Foundation so that we can once again have a town square free of algorithms and corporate control.”\n\n\nWhich makes absolutely no sense when you put these words and these developers right next to Meta, and Threads.\n\nI’ve spoken a lot about Threads. I feel like, if you’re an instance provider on the Fedi, it’s entirely up to you whether you want to federate with them or not. But let’s not forget, Meta is a corporation. One of the richest corporations in the world, who definitely have corporate interests when it comes to social media, the web, and ActivityPub.\n\nOn top of that, it has been almost an entire year, and they still have not fully integrated federation on Threads. As it stands right now, likes and comments coming from the Fediverse show up as additional links you have to click multiple times in order to see, while on Threads. It’s a very tacked-on, a very, “These people aren’t Threads users, but here they are if you really want to see them” kind of gesture. Right now, its mostly superficial, and it rubs me the wrong way. It makes me feel like they don’t have any intention of true integration.\n\nNot mentioned, but included in the list, are Mastodon and Pixelfed. These are, at least, entities that have been involved for a long time, and are partially responsible for the Fediverse becoming just a little bit more mainstream than it was before.\n\nBut where’s the mention of Akkoma, Pleroma, GNU Social, Freindika, Misskey, Peertube, and so on, and so forth? Are we just going to ignore them into the ether?\n\nThe Fediverse is home to something like … 15 million people or so (not that much more than Bluesky, and with this news, bsky devs are probably sharting themselves)? And it’s only growing as users on Threads turn on federation. But if companies and corporations can’t see themselves as part of the Fediverse without injecting money, sponsors, and ads into it, then they should get out, and stay out. The internet is overrun with sludge-content designed to waste your time and steal your attention for someone else’s financial gain. Rebuilding the open web is completely and entirely about escaping all of that, for good. It’s about bringing back the days of people, building their own spaces, having their own ideas and conversations free of algorithms and corporate influence.\n\nTo want to interfere in that, and possibly even destroy it, well. Maybe I should full-block Threads, and other corporate entrances into the Fediverse via my instance.\n\nI really don’t know right now.\n"

To say that I’m a bit pissed off is an understatement.\n\nSo, let’s get straight to the vomit from the horse’s mouth:\n\n\n  “I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content in the grand scheme of this,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, which coincides with Meta’s annual Connect event. “My guess is that there are going to be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable.” But if creators are concerned or object, “when push comes to shove, if they demanded that we don’t use their content, then we just wouldn’t use their content. It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.”\n\n\nFrom this point forward, mkultra.monster will be suspending any and all interaction with Threads.net. I won’t tell others what to do, but I’ve been teetering on this decision for a while. There are cool and decent people on Threads, but it’s just not worth it.\n\nA billionaire thinks all of your thoughts, your memories, your written and graphical work and design … isn’t worth shit.\n\nBut, it must be worth a hell of a lot if you’re feeding it into your sludge machine so that you can generate some glossy garbage that sucks ass, am I wrong?\n\nEither way, I’m going to do what I should’ve done months ago, and I’m gonna Zuck the Zuck.\n\nGo to hell, Meta.\n\n“It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.” Are the words of a man giving every writer, developer, creator, and artist a big, bold middle finger.\n\nThose are all the words I have to give right now, and it’s exactly the right amount.\n"

Or, if you’re busy, in a jam, or generally unable to be in Second Life right this moment, you can see them on the marketplace page.\n\nYou might notice that the store location has changed again, but let me explain. The current location is a backup that I’ve had for a little over a month, in the event that I would have to move from the location that was provided to me. It turns out, I unfortunately have to do that. I attribute no fault to Logan, and I extend my deepest gratitude for being allowed to use the land he had in order to host my store.

    "content": "It’s been a couple of days since I’ve written anything. Part of that is because my day job highly makes me feel like I don’t want to do anything when I get out of work. The other part of it, is that I spent hours and hours refreshing and updating the look and feel of my site (it’s cooler now). Now that I’ve done that, I’d like to write about Vivaldi.\n\nA little while ago I wrote about the on-going blunders of the Mozilla Foundation, and their head-long dive into AI, and the manipulation of hiding data hijacking within features that promise privacy. Basically, Mozilla needs money, and they’re selling their souls in order to get it.\n\nIf you’re like me, and you just want a good browser that doesn’t have a ton of bloat, that isn’t taking your private data and selling it to some corporation, or what-have-you, then you already know what you need.\n\nA better browser.\n\nFirefox has been my go-to for a long time. It’s a decent browser! But, if I decide I want to actually interact with AI, I don’t need it embedded in frikken’ Firefox. And I don’t think this is where their resources, their time, and their effort should be going.\n\nThat’s why I’ve switched to Vivaldi. A browser I think I’ve heard of before, but never really used? Never-the-less, I was pretty surprised when I finally did. I mean, right off the bat, they’ve pledged not to dedicate resources to integrate AI into their browser. Which, for all intents and purposes, that’s all you gotta say!\n\n\n  As such, it does not feel right to bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are available.\n\n\nI’m a very hard-no on AI generated “art.” Ripping people off in order to funnel money into people’s pockets, who’ve done nothing but write a sentence, is the epitome of evil and greed. Using regular AI to generate text, or books, or anything of the sort, is definitely the same kind of plagiarist evil. But, I will acknowledge that there can be some uses in regard to AI chat bots … even though the power consumption is just as bad, or worse than the blockchain and NFTs. So, I find it really hard to justify using them. I have, though. I’ve asked an AI for some ideas on writing prompts to get my juices flowing. I’ve used an AI over my phone at work to help customers when I don’t know the answer to, “What kind of battery do I need for a Ford Pinto 1992, 4 cylinder, special edition, Pro Max?” And it has helped.\n\nI will admit, and be transparent, in that I have personally found some use in these things. But I also ask myself, “Could I have just found this information on a search engine that isn’t mired by crud? Could I have done it without using a machine that’s on its way to being hooked up to a nuclear reactor twenty miles away from me?”\n\nBut, all of that’s beside my point in this article, in that, Vivaldi isn’t going to put this stuff into their browser. And they’re not ignoring their userbase in order to do whatever they want, for profit, and for violation of privacy. And that’s a big breath of fresh air.\n\nAnd all of this is completely aside from the absolutely cool as hell features Vivaldi has built-in.\n\nThe browser … AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKS ADS! You don’t need an extension! IT WORKS ON YOUTUBE. You can just view websites, ad-free, by … opening your web browser? Holy crap.\n\nOf course, you have customization options, sync options, theme options, password and bookmark import and saving, and so on and so forth. But what I’ve found really useful, is the right-side bar that you can connect to your Apple calendar, and the RSS feed aggregator that you can just plug some RSS into, and see updates from all the blogs you read, live, right there on the side of your browser. There’s a translate button, a note button, a reminders button, a button that opens their personal Vivaldi Mastodon instance, and so much more.\n\nIt’s the end-all, be-all of browsers, and I cannot believe that this isn’t some super famous, extremely well-known browser and company that’s taking the entire world by storm … Because they should be.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to write about how impressed I am with the Vivaldi browser. I can’t say I’m too sure what’s going on with the Social Web Foundation, but what that entails for sure remains to be seen.\n\nI think you should give it a go.\n"

    "content": "So, I didn’t really try to write a click-baity headline for this post. Partially because, usually, when I share what I write, it doesn’t even show a headline. But, you’re probably wondering, “What could Mastodon/the fediverse possibly have that MySpace doesn’t?”\n\nTwitter has fabricated and AI generated misinformation, Threads has influencers in a battle royale to see who can steal the most posts written by normal people, Bluesky has all the bullies from social justice circles who never got anywhere with their quote-tweet dogpiling, and Mastodon has …\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnarky and sarcastic remarks aside, this isn’t really isolated to Mastodon. It’s just that it’s named after Mastodon. But, like all things on the fediverse, it reaches most software connected to it. But that’s not what this post is about. We’re talking about something here that I’ve never really seen outside of Discord channels and chat-rooms.\n\nA community-wide sort of event that happens every Sunday at 9pm eastern standard time.\n\nA cheesy horror or monster movie is chosen, usually from anywhere between the forties, fifties, and sixties (and maybe sometimes the seventies and eighties), and then everyone who wants to, loads up the movie at the aforementioned time, and the fediverse turns into a waterfall of a huge amount of people posting to the #monsterdon hashtag their impressions and witticisms about whatever movie they all happen to be watching in that given week. Jesus, that was a hell of a run-on sentence.\n\nI participated in it once so far, and then every subsequent time its happened since, I forget, and forget, and forget. But I do peek in every once in a while, when it happens, and I’m suddenly reminded that I forgot to participate. And … it’s kind of amazing?\n\nIn the past decade, social media has transformed into this thing where people are target searching. They’re looking for someone to dunk, looking for someone to use for engagement and five minutes of fame. Looking for things they hate so that they can react, and reaffirm to their followers that their opinions are the correct and best opinions to have.\n\nIn some cases, this is kind of exaggerated and not nearly as bad as it sounds. Taking a stand against injustice is good, even if there are people out there using these things for their own personal gain and fame. But, I’m trying to reinforce that, over all these years, a lot of social media has turned into this negative experience that most of us are heavily addicted to. No matter how bad the car crash, ya just can’t stop looking at it. The mangled metal, the broken glass, it’s like candy for the brain-juice. Uh … or maybe people don’t really look at a car crash like that, but you get what I mean!\n\nAnd then you stumble into Mastodon, or the fediverse, and every Sunday there’s just people watching a dang movie. They’re not fighting, not spitting bile, just … enjoying something … together! In a fully digital space, where I’m assuming most people don’t even know each other!\n\nIt kind of reinforces this idea that the fediverse is the old web, reborn. The social web, resurrected. I definitely would’ve expected to see something like this on MySpace, if that sort of thing would’ve been possible back then. But definitely not on Twitter, or any of those other sites that are less about being social, and more about capital gains. And with all of the definitely bad things happening in the world, it’s just kind of nice to see totally normal and cool things happening. Totally nice things that definitely don’t suck.\n\nI wanted to write this post just to say, keep it up! Let’s do more of this in different ways!\n"

Drinking our Ecto-Coolers, slipping on Velcro sneakers, uh, watching Rocko’s Modern Life.\n\nBut sometimes I also wish it was still 2012. Still in the midst of the Mass Effect trilogy, the greatest game series ever created. Still logging onto a mostly normal Facebook to get my daily clicks in Mafia Wars and Farmville.\n\n\n\nA time when Sims 3 was the latest and greatest of the franchise, and all I was doing in the game was walking my sim around collecting diamonds and rocks, and trying to figure out what kind of bathroom she should have. When I was still mystified by new experiences, and finding wonder in exploring new narratives. Back when the iPhone still had what I think were the best icon graphics, a headphone jack, and iPods! Yeah, I had an iPod Touch! …that I played digital poker with.\n\nWhen I’d jump on Google cam-chats with friends, lay in bed, and just talk all night long, and when Youtube was just a place where people uploaded random weird stuff that wasn’t designed to pull you in and keep you there for ad-rolls and sponsored segments.\n\n… when cigarettes only cost like, four dollars a pack.\n\nA year wherein I’d get out of work and still have the energy to do things that I enjoy.\n\nI miss 2012.\n\nThere’s no use living in the past, but there were a lot of great things about technology in the 90s, and 2000s, and even 2010. And then suddenly it all started going downhill. Things advanced, but for no reason. Oh boy, bigger cameras, larger screens, thinner bezels, s … streaming? I don’t own my music and movies anymore? All the casual games I liked using to pass time are on my phone? Sweet! … oh, almost all of them are copies of each other and filled with so much money-grubbing they could only really be classified as a game for the first 5 minutes that you interact with it?\n\nInstagram is about posting engagement-bait and getting popular with short-form content until you can … get sponsored with product placement?\n\nTwitter got murdered by Elon Musk and now it’s just nazis and ai-gen spam?\n\nWhat the heck?\n\nI miss 2012.\n\nIt’s not all bad. We got Mastodon, we got a federated network of users taking ownership of their content, and the indie web (a revival of the 90s internet). There are still good games out there, and a whole lot of indie developers who make some real gems. But, man, do you really have to sift through mountains and oceans of garbage to find content and entertainment actually worth consuming.\n\nOr, maybe I’m just getting older, and everything is just fine the way it is.\n\nWho knows.\n"

    "content": "It’s been at least two months since I’ve done one of Jetpack’s writing prompts. Largely, because, I ditched Wordpress and decided to build something from scratch. It seems, in light of the Wordpress CEO’s recent blunders, it was probably a good idea to abandon Wordpress. But I really only did it because I enjoy writing everything in VS Code, rather than a glitchy editor. Nevertheless, I still have Automattic’s “jetpack” app installed on my phone, and it serves me interesting writing prompts every once in a while, and because I don’t enjoy writing about a crisis every single time I fire up the VSC, I think I’ll snag this one.\n\nSo, full-stop, I had access to a computer in about 1992, I believe. I think I spoke about this before, but it was something my Dad was provided by his job, and it wasn’t exactly up-to-date with current versions of Windows. It was more like a mid-80s machine with extremely early versions of DOS, and bulletin boards. The menu was built into a permanent console, like something you write through via Linux (for the zoomies who don’t know what the hell DOS is), and it was … pretty basic.\n\nI think that thing is still sitting around, somewhere out there.\n\nAs time marched forward, we got another PC, and another PC, and then a Gateway 486, and then that was largely what I used, until I was given another “hand-me-down”-ish PC when I was around 15 or 16. About the time I discovered anime forums, and started e-dating as many girls as I could … with video chat over aol instant messenger, and … a whole lot of embarrassing things I probably shouldn’t have been sharing with girls I, ultimately, didn’t really know, at all.\n\nThen, when I graduated, I was gifted another PC, which is when I really started gaming. And then years later I built one myself, and then I upgraded it, and then I bought another PC. And then I ditched that one, and bought one in 2018, and then I ditched that one, too, and bought the powerhouse Linux PC I’m currently using today (alongside the Windows Dell, and Macbook I have as side machines).\n\nWhat would life be like, had none of this ever happened?\n\nI guess I’d probably watch paint dry? Or, am I still allowed to have my iPhone? Cause, if that’s the case, I guess the only thing that’d be different is I’d probably be some kind of prolific mobile gamer, who never got into web development. Maybe I’d be streaming to Twitch via my phone as I bumble around Genshin Impact. Who knows!\n\nBut, let’s say the phone is also a computer.\n\nThis question is far too open-ended for the 2020s, don’t you think?\n\nSo, no PC, no laptops, no phone, no toasters with touch-screens, and we’ll just assume, in this version of the universe, my job also hasn’t given me a phone to work with.\n\nAlright.\n\nSince television is mainly on streaming now, and basic “appointment TV” doesn’t really exist anymore (and by that, I mean, episodic television that isn’t dumped all at once), I guess I’d probably have a Smart TV, and I’d probably spend a lot of my time watching shows. Maybe I’d also read a lot more. I don’t know if I’d be writing, because … I guess I’d have to do that by hand? Like a baby. But, that’s the thing, a smart TV is also a computer! We’ll, for the sake of this post, just pretend that it isn’t, though.\n\nI don’t know if I’d have a richer social life, because I think factors that made it harder for me to connect with people in the 2020s, aren’t really related to having access to a PC, but more that people in-general are, or have, isolated themselves in their own little bubbles of media that they themselves dictate. Which, in-turn, makes casual conversation impossible.\n\nBut … without access to all of the world’s knowledge and information, I guess I’d probably be a lot more uninformed. I’d probably be much more susceptible to just believing anything anyone tells me. I’d probably question things less. I wouldn’t have random college credits sitting on my name, and I guess I wouldn’t have a resume, either?\n\nJesus.\n\nUh, I think we’ll skip this universe.\n\nI think it’s pretty important to have access to technology, and the internet. Because, just sitting here thinking about what life would be like without all this stuff, sounds … horrifying. And, maybe that’s nerdy. But damn, dude, no. No I don’t think I’d want to live a life of watching TV and sleeping.\n"

In writing my own, I now see why that may happen, because I’m basically just throwing in solutions I used and hoping they stick!\n\nNow, obviously, this means you have to have your PC turned on at all times, unless of course you setup a server on a remote PC, such as renting a VPS over at Digital Ocean. I’ve considered this for myself, but I don’t know if sending myself a daily report of trending posts in subreddits is really something I should just dump money into.

This is incongruent with current trends of the past decade and a half, of the music industry pushing real hard for streaming. Streaming, which pays fractions of a penny of a penny on a dollar, while the rich consume the profits. This has only been exasperated since AI came into the scene, with people absent of talent and inspiration, generating absolute garbage (and this isn’t just a problem in music, it’s everywhere).\n\nI personally haven’t seen, heard, or noticed any detrimental effects of Bandcamp being bought-out, but it’s good to be prepared. To be prepared in an age where Mozilla is suddenly an ad agency, Microsoft is developing spyware, OpenAI is asking governments for enough electrical power to destroy the entire planet, and Apple is releasing products people don’t want.\n\nWe’re living in a universe that is slowly becoming a perpetual backwards day (not that Microsoft was ever a decent forward-thinking company, or that OpenAI ever had any good intentions with their grift of theft, but I digress…).\n\nBut there are those who read my musings, who know I’m a freak for the fediverse.\n\nYou might guess where this is going.\n\n“Wait, are you about to tell me that there’s a motherfuggin’ Bandcamp, ON THE FEDIVERSE?”\n\nYes, yes I am about to tell you that, Fortnite Gamer.\n\nThis morning, while I was slogging away at getting ready for work, I saw a post flash past my Mastodon feed, something like, “It’s Bandcamp, but on the fediverse!”\n\nI thought to myself, “Hmm, okay. I’ll bookmark this for 10 hours from now.”\n\n    \n\n\n\nSo, I clicked the link and followed through to Bandwagon.fm, and, my dudes …\n\nI now have a “bandcamp” on the fediverse, over here.\n\nSave for the ability to actually sell your music (which I assume they’re working on?), you can upload whole entire albums here, and then people can stumble in and listen to what you’ve made! That’s WILD. … on the FEDIVERSE?!\n\nWhat I did here with my page, though, is I took the 3 most recent albums I did under Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and re-published them under my new name, PLEXX. Once I finally finish disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX, I’ll be putting that album there, too.\n\nBut this is so cool, and it’s connected to Musicbrainz, another open-source music cataloguing project!\n\nEarlier today, I was having second thoughts about Linux, and sticking to open source and all that. Mostly because, I sort of miss a few programs that I’m having trouble getting working on Pop!_OS. But this kind of turned me around a bit. There’s no reason to go back to the bastardized version of whatever Bill Gates had in mind 30 years ago. This proves to me that regular people will restore the internet to what it should have always been.\n\nThe only thing it takes, is patience, and a whole lot less second-guessing myself and my decisions. And also maybe I need to sit in front of my computer screen a little less here and there. My eyes hurt.\n\nAnyway, I can’t wait to see what the heck comes next, holy crap.\n\n"

Failure, in that, sometimes people post AI-generated sludge to Reddit, and that may get caught in the bot. If it happens too often, I’ll either figure out how to exclude that stuff, or just not include that specific subreddit in the bot’s pull.\n\nThis is sort of still ongoing, too. I tried a bunch of different tricks to get the bot to stop posting the preview, tiny, pixelated image, but to no avail. Or, maybe to vail. It may be just my instance that isn’t uploading them correctly, but I’m not sure yet.\n\nIf you want to see the bot directly, it’s here. Warning, though, some of the posts it grabs are NSFW and entirely lewd.

So, I made it so that my Reddit-Bot also posts random status (which are predefined), that are pulled from a json file.\n\nAs it turns out, small-time bots are a little bit easier. The way that I accomplished this, was by making a secondary bot, that uses the same Mastodon access codes, and runs every 13 minutes, outside of the 10 minute window that the Reddit bot uses (simulating what a normal person might post like … if they were a bot).\n\nYou can see the Chatter-Bot on Github.\n\nNow, I’m aware that all these little worker-bots I’ve built have all been built before, albeit, probably in different ways, and with different code. But these all also work, and they do specific things that I’m sure the others probably don’t.\n\nI updated the Reddit-Post bot to include Reddit usernames and the subreddit that they came from (so that it’s more clear), and I made it so the bot will periodically look for followers, and follow new follows plus unfollow defollows (emulating a real influencer!).\n\nAs far as the Chatter-Bot goes, it also has embedded replies that it’ll shoot at you if you send it a mention. This is structured much the same way the status posts are, except they’re only used when someone goes, “Hey @net_run@mkultra.monster, what the hell are you on about?”\n\nNow … in regards to my “Mafia Hustle” Mafia Wars clone, uh.

I started screwing around with Python after spending time casually reading about it, and decided to learn it, hands-on, and I smashed up a slew of interesting things. Then, I started thinking about, despite my love for Linux, and especially Debian, there are some critical things I still don’t have access to while on Linux.\n\nSuch as things I use for my creations in Second Life, like Quixel, Marvelous Designer. And how I’m basically locked to only using Gimp. And, regrettably, there are a few games I want to play that I just can’t. With these things in mind, I decided to mess around and put Windows on my System76 machine. It wasn’t all that painful, because I have all of my important stuff backed up on the cloud, and I don’t mind redownloading games as I decide I’m interested in playing them.\n\nBut … And this could end up being the reason I decide to just put Linux back onto my PC: Turning Windows into a machine for a developer is a pain in the ass.\n\nFrom configuring SSH, to realizing I didn’t have OpenSSH, to installing OpenSSH, to configuring PowerShell, to downloading the actual latest version, to screwing with SSH keys, to adding, deleting, adding, deleting, adding, deleting, and adding and deleting about 15 different keys, before I generated a new one, and then manually pasted the key into the authorizations on my Debian server.\n\nOh, but then there’s VS Code … An apparent Microsoft centric developer app, that crashes against a wall as soon as you try to push and sync? Because apparently, or at least in my case, it doesn’t know to use OpenSSH?!\n\nNevertheless, here I am, with access to all of my games, and every single program I used to use, and also my developer tools setup exactly the same way they were in Pop!_OS.\n\nI do have to say that I really like Pop!_OS, but I’m not that excited about merging and migrating my entire system to the Rust based COSMIC. I don’t know. I … kind of like Ubuntu, you know?\n\nAll that aside, we’ll see how long this lasts. Despite the shortcomings, Linux is really a revolutionary OS, and I’ll probably put it all back sometime in the future. Probably when I get tired of the games I wanted to play, and decide to figure out the workarounds for the apps I want to use in Windows (I don’t like using Virtual Machines, I just want to interact with my actual PC).\n\nBut, until then, I’m going to see how far I can stretch Windows into giving me control of the system.\n"

Do you miss that? Oh, yeah, me either. But, the old part of Twitter I’m actually talking about here, are the bots that people used to setup, that read from their tweets, and then shot out a randomized post. I think some of them were called like, “John Reads” or “John Books”, wherein they’d put their name and qualify it with something related to writing or reading. Either way, remember that? Do ya?\n\nWell, I recreated that in a bot, that reads from a spreadsheet of your posts, jumbles it, randomizes it, restructures it, and then posts them semi-logically, to Mastodon.\n\nYou can see post_gen_bot on Github.\n\nNow, in my use-case for this, I have it reading from Google Sheets I’ve generated as backups of every single post I’ve made to Mastodon since the beginning of 2024, because … I just didn’t know what to do with all of that, until now. But, I’m assuming, if you really wanted to, you could feed your old backed-up tweets from a deleted Twitter account, into this bot, and then have it post jumbled nonsense from your posting-past on social media.\n\nThat’d be kinda neat, right?\n\nNow, this is like the 4th or 5th bot I’ve made? I don’t know, I’m losing count already.\n\nBut, I have had a little bit of aggression directed toward me via the fediverse. Because, some people just don’t think. They don’t consider what they’re doing, or read what they’re targeting. They don’t particularly care if you’ve spent time making something interesting, or neat, and would simply request that you mute, delete, and ban your work.\n\nTo those people, I say, lighten the frikk up. Don’t waste your reports, just use the mute function. I don’t make these things to please other people, or to meet your expectations or specific specifications of what you personally believe the fediverse should be. I do this for me. And if you don’t like that, you don’t have to see it.\n\nIt reminds me of years back, on another Mastodon account, where I was posting about Tomb Raider and how cool the iteration of the game I was playing, happened to be, and this … I don’t want to call them “extremely online,” because there was something else wrong with them, entirely, but this person came into my notifications, and they were like, “I don’t care about Tomb Raider, why are you talking about this?”\n\nAnd I was taken aback, like … There are legitimately people out there who fully and completely believe the entire world, and everyone in it, revolves around them, specifically. And that’s frikken nuts.\n\nI don’t think this is a problem that only exists on Mastodon, though. I think this is wide-spread, across all of social media, and the internet, and it’s only been exasperated by a society that celebrates individualism and isolation, and so on, and so forth. I could go on for hours, but this is a topic for another time.\n\nEither way, for those that like bots, here’s another one for you.\n"

    "content": "So, today, I was playing Quake 1 and 2, and something ocurred to me, that hadn’t ever ocurred to me in the 28 to 30 years that these games have been a thing: I’ve never fully understood what in the hell the story is supposed to be. Obviously, we’re going to skip Quake 3, not because it isn’t good (it’s one of the greatest arena shooters of all time), but because its story is more that of Unreal Tournament. In that, it’s just people from different dimensions fighting in nonstop deathmatch.\n\nBut … if you’ve ever seen those memes online where people poke fun at games where they’re like, “Hey, who’s John Darksouls?” and someone’s like, “He’s the main character of Dark Souls, cousin of John Halo.” … You’re going to love the story behind Quake 1.\n\n\n\nThe background, according to the Wiki.\n\n\n  You get the phone call at 4 a.m. By 5:30 you’re in the secret installation. The commander explains tersely, “It’s about the Slipgate device. Once we perfect these, we’ll be able to use them to transport people and cargo from one place to another instantly.\n\n\n\n  “An enemy codenamed Quake, [sic] is using his own slipgates to insert death squads inside our bases to kill, steal, and kidnap.\n\n\n\n  “The hell of it is we have no idea where he’s from. Our top scientists think Quake’s not from Earth, but another dimension. They say Quake’s preparing to unleash his real army, whatever that is.\n\n\n\n  “You’re our best man. This is Operation Counterstrike and you’re in charge. Find Quake, and stop him … or it … You have full authority to requisition anything you need. If the eggheads are right, all our lives are expendable.”\n\n\nBut that’s not all!\n\n\n  While scouting the neighborhood, you hear shots back at the base. Damn, that Quake bastard works fast! He heard about Operation Counterstrike, and hit first. Racing back, you see the place is overrun. You are almost certainly the only survivor. Operation Counterstrike is over. Except for you.\n\n\n\n  You know that the heart of the installation holds a slipgate. Since Quake’s killers came through, it is still set to his dimension. You can use it to get loose in his hometown. Maybe you can get to the asshole personally. You pump a round into your shotgun, and get moving.\n\n\nAnd that’s it! I mean, obviously, it continues a bit into the actual game, where you’re traversing different dimensions and collecting runes … killing enemies like something out of Lovecraft, but in its most basic sense, and I mean no offense to those who worked or work for ID Software and on this game, but if I didn’t know what Quake was, I would assume this was a sixth grader’s creative writing homework. I mean, it just starts talking at you, as if you already know what’s going on? It starts out in 2nd-person perspective and never leaves that narrative. And then there’s “Operation Counterstrike,” which makes me wonder where the original devs behind CounterStrike got their game’s name from.\n\nEspecially because Team Fortress was originally a Quake multiplayer mod made by the community (in the 90s).\n\nI wanted to read through all of this, because I also didn’t understand the connection between this game, and the second game, where we’re suddenly invading the Strogg’s home planet, and there’s me thinking, “Who the heck are the Strogg, again?”\n\nThe short answer to that question, is: The Strogg and Quake 2 have almost nothing to do with Quake 1. It’s a restart, and I kind of found that a little disappointing. The theme of Quake 1 is really cool, and it feels a bit more linked to Doom in the way it handles its world … even if the lore really leaves something to be desired.\n\nQuake 2’s basic lore (via this Wiki):\n\n\n  Quake II takes place in a futuristic sci-fi environment. During the single player campaign, you take the role of a Marine called Bitterman, taking part in “Operation Alien Overlord”, attempting to save Earth from the Strogg invasion by counter-attacking their planet, Stroggos. During the first attack on Stroggos, the Big Gun strikes down most of the Marine pods with a powerful EMP blast. This causes most of the pods to crash land (many miles from their target landing zones). Most of the Marines are captured or killed, but Bitterman is one of the lucky few to survive. He finds himself many miles from the Big Gun in a Strogg base on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\nIt almost sounds like they retconned the enemy’s name to be Strogg, (pronounced stroeg), rather than John Quake, the main antagonist of planet Quake, from Quake.\n\nAnd I guess, if you think of it in that way, it makes a little more sense. The Strogg invasion of Earth … could be considered parallel to “Quake’s” invasion of a military base, and therefore … Earth. Maybe. But, I’m just kind of inserting my own canon into something that’s been over and done with for decades.\n\nThe subsequent games all follow strings of lore from Quake 2 (mostly), and I think only Quake 3 acknowledges Quake 1. Which, again, is a shame. I definitely feel like ID should come back for another full Quake release, and give us some continuity here. Even if it only matters to like … five people.\n"

    "url": "/gaming/2024/10/13/31-years-later-let-s-look-at-doom-s-lore-the-original.html",
    "content": "Yesterday, I wrote about Quake and, by extension, Quake 2’s lore. You might think that Doom’s original lore is probably really simple, some kind of, scratches on a paper looking concept, and while it certainly began that way–It also spawned a book. But, one of the reasons I want to visit the lore of the original Dooms, is because the newer Dooms seem … unclear to me, as to where exactly they are in the timeline. Or, if there even is a timeline. Anyway, let’s dive a little deeper into the 1993 classic, DOOM.\n\n\n\n\nSo, basically, all this time, I’ve been extremely confused about whether or not you’re the same guy in every Doom game ever made. The short answer is: Yes, you are.\n\nBut, I feel like I can’t talk about the lore of all of Doom, without quoting the original opening fiction that started it all (quoted from the fandom wiki).\n\n\n  In DOOM, you’re a space marine, one of Earth’s toughest, hardened in combat and trained for action. Three years ago you assaulted a superior officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians. He and his body cast were shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home of the Union Aerospace Corporation. The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos. With no action for fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin’ dust and watchin’ restricted flicks in the rec room.\n\n\n\n  For the last four years the military, UAC’s biggest supplier, has used the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various secret projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel. So far they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos, throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other. Recently however, the gateways have grown dangerously unstable. Military “volunteers” entering them have either disappeared or been stricken with a strange form of insanity–babbling vulgarities, bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering an untimely death of full-body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to send home to the folks became a full-time job. Latest military reports state that the research is suffering a small setback, but everything is under control.\n\n\n\n  A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos. “We require immediate military support. Something fraggin’ evil is coming out of the gateways! Computer systems have gone berserk!” The rest was incoherent. Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky. Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n  You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles were sent up pronto to Phobos. You were ordered to secure the perimeter of the base while the rest of the team went inside. For several hours, your radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders, screams, bones cracking, then finally silence. Seems your buddies are dead.\n\n\n\n  Things aren’t looking too good. You’ll never navigate off the planet on your own. Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by the assault team leaving you only with a pistol. If only you could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in the forehead. Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.\n\n\n\n  As you walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls echoing throughout the distant corridors. They know you’re here. There’s no turning back now.\n\n\nNow, I know what you’re thinking, “This game came before Quake, and it already has a much more fleshed out story?” Yeah, kinda weird, right? It continues on like this, into a book, onto Earth, as the invasion of Hell continues, into Doom 64 where you return to Hell, then to Doom 2016 where you’re … entombed, and then awoken in an alternate reality, and it just keeps going.\n\nI remember when I was a kid, I was only partially aware of all this lore. In fact, I think the only thing I paid attention to was the Doom guy holding his rabbit’s severed head at the end of the game. Oh, and the nightmares I had where, in the middle of the night, I actually hallucinated Lost Souls flying in and out of my room, and it was terrifying at the time (I think I was forced to take a break from the game at this point).\n\nBut did you know Doom guy had a family? And that family was murdered by Demons? Did you know there was a theatrical recreation of Doom that starts off with transphobia, and then explains away the demons completely by being like, “Oh, no it’s not demons. It’s humans infected with another chromosome.” I didn’t like that movie much, aside from the strange inclusion of the game-dev’s names, as characters, in the movie.\n\nDid you know that, according to the official Doom book, the Doom marine’s name is Corporal Flynn Taggart? I’m not sure this is ever held up as canon anywhere else, but it’s a neat little tidbit. The book itself had two nebula nominees, and here’s the synopsis for you …\n\n\n  The Gates were there on Phobos when mankind first arrived. Inert, unyielding, impossibly alien constructs, for twenty years they sat lifeless, mute testaments to their long-vanished creators, their secrets hidden. Then one day, they sprang to life . . .\n\n\n\n  Meet Corporal Flynn Taggart, United States Marine Corps; serial number 888-23-9912. He’s the best warrior the twenty-first century has to offer, which is a damn good thing. Because Flynn Taggart is all that’s standing between the hell that just dropped in on Mars and an unsuspecting planet Earth . . .\n\n\nI’m more quoting, and reflecting on all of this, because, I’m just now really discovering just how much lore there actually is behind Doom, and finding that it really doesn’t need a whole lot of discussion and deep dives. But, I do think I want to finally read that book.\n\nNever-the-less, this is kind of where my obsession with gaming really started. Sure, there was Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone, Commander Keen, Ja … Jazz JackRabbit? But then there was DOOM. And then fond memories watching my Dad play Quake FTP multiplayer against one of his friends, and then me being absolutely badass in Quake 2 multiplayer … and then finding I SUCKED HARD in Quake 3 multiplayer (because they completely changed the way the game felt, controlled, and aimed).\n\nMy entire childhood was me, waiting for school to be over, so that I could dive back into one of these games. And, despite my delve into coding at the age of 39, I find it strange I never just, you know, started making my own games. At least, until I started making this Mafia Wars clone, that I absolutely am not going to continue, because I don’t think I have the correct know-how to securely store people’s usernames and passwords on an encrypted database, on a server that can’t easily be hacked. But … maybe there is room for something else.\n\n\n\n(Yes, this is an actual semi-functional clone of Mafia Wars, that can only be played by me, on my HDD, and I will never release it to the public lol Nevermind, here it is.)\n"

    "url": "/tech/2024/10/15/i-can-t-recommend-nekoweb-a-neocities-alternative.html",
    "content": "Today I woke up, and, like I do, I checked my “daily report” bot e-mail, and noticed something … strange. According to the Neocities subreddit, the person behind Neocities had written, a year ago, some positive thinking about AI (which, I’m not sure can be fully judged a year later, since it’s only gotten extremely bad, this year). In response, some users were suggesting Nekoweb as an alternative for people who don’t want to be potentially affiliated with someone who endorses Sam Altman. And then I stumbled into an issue, and the strangest people I’ve met this week (so far).\n\nNekoweb is much like Neocities, and even more-so, it offers services that Neocities doesn’t. At first glance, this seems pretty awesome. You have more storage space, more bandwith, access to Git, FTP, and it’s even got framework for deploying your site with a static generator (like Jekyll). “Sweet.” I thought, this could really make my life easier, instead of pushing through Github, to Neocities, right?\n\nThere’s just one problem.\n\n\n\nNekoweb requires you reveal all personal information to them, in order to register an account. VPNs are not allowed.\n\nThe only other place online, thus far, that I’ve had any issue with using my VPN, be it via Proton’s subscription service that I use for e-mail, or Apple’s built-in VPN, has been Misskey’s flagship server (that auto-blocks Western users from registering). Not even Activision blocks you from using a VPN while playing their highly competitive shooters, Call of Duty.\n\nSo, like ya do, I joined their Discord, curious, a little bummed. Thinking, there’s no way I have to turn off something completely related to my own online safety and privacy just to make an account here, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nI don’t feel the need to post direct screenshots, since this website is seen by quite a few more people than my Mastodon account, so I’ll just quote the person who immediately replied to me when I asked, “So why can’t I have my VPN turned on when I’m making an account?”\n\nUser / Supporter / or maybe even dev? responds:\n\n\n  why are you using VPN to register an account?\n\n\n\n  we had spammers use VPN to comment hate stuff on users guestbooks\n\n\n\n  probably why [team member affiliated with Nekoweb] doesn’t allow vpn\n\n\nThe Nekoweb team member responds,\n\n\n  abuse prevention\n\n\nFlabbergasted, blown-away, I respond, “I use a VPN provided by Proton’s subscription service that comes along with their e-mail, entirely just for privacy lol”\n\nTo which the first user replies, again,\n\n\n  well in order to register you need proper internet connection and no VPN.\n\n\n…\n\nPROPER INTERNET CONNECTION???\n\nIt was at this point I kind of fell off and spiraled a bit, implied neither of them know what they’re doing, and left.\n\nSo, no, I absolutely wouldn’t recommend you use Nekoweb as an alternative to Neocities, if that’s what you’re looking for. How people who don’t even know what a VPN does, or is used for by average people, ended up making an entire web service, is wild, ridiculous, and makes absolutely no sense. And I get the impression that they don’t want new users, or any subscription money for that matter. Which is fine. They aren’t getting any from me.\n\nFor anyone else, who might be a little more rationally inclined, why use a VPN?\n\nIt’s not just for watching shows on Netflix you can’t get in the US. Some countries are blocked from most internet access and can’t interact with the outside world, without a VPN. Guess they aren’t allowed to make websites, either?\n\nWhy do I use a VPN? I use one, because I don’t think every website and provider needs my personal information at all times, every single time I access a domain. I especially don’t think the developers behind Nekoweb need my personal information, just to make an account on their Neocities clone. Entitled to my data as they may be, if you have a problem with spam and abuse coming from users behind VPNs, and you just ban VPN use, uhm, guys? You know that perpetrators of abuse can just make a new e-mail and do exactly the same thing, without a VPN? They could drive down the street to McDonalds, log on, and continue harassing your users.\n\nAnd, I’m sorry, I’m still reeling over “proper internet connection.”\n\nI’m just out of words in my brain sauce that would allow me to express how ridiculous that sounds … you guys made this web service? For real? You made a whole web service for hosting websites and you don’t even know the first thing about privacy and safety online?\n\nHoly hell.\n\n"

    "content": "While I’m on this kick of looking back over the years at old games that are still mega-popular, I also want to look at games that maybe nobody remembers, or even knows about. No, I’m not talking about Daikatana. That game is pretty cool, and I’m pretty sure it’s also very well known. I’m talking about Julie and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, a game that came, then said, “Hey!” and subsequently vanished into the ether of game development … seemingly, forever.\n\n\n\nA game built on the Quake 3 engine, based on / a sequel to Heavy Metal 2000 (a movie, release July 10, 2000), and developed by the now defunct and erased Ritual Entertainment (see: SiN, SiN: Emergence).\n\nIf you asked me, “Nova, why do you think this game failed?” I don’t think I’d be able to answer! It’s a fantasy style boobs, guns, and swords sorta game (you know how the late 90s and 2000s were in regard to gaming) that was trying to be Ritual’s version of Tomb Raider. I emphasize the boobs part, because, as you got damaged in the game, so did Julie’s outfit.\n\nThe synopsis was as follows:\n\n\n  F.A.K.K. 2 stands for “Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone to the second level”, and is the alias both of the heroine, Julie, and also her homeworld. Before the game begins, we are told that Julie has previously killed a tyrant and “would-be God” named Lord Tyler (during the events of Heavy Metal 2000), and brought the remnant of her people to a planet called Eden. The people of Eden have made a startling discovery: the waters of the planet grant an eternal life to those who drink it, and they have restored ti-rural paradise, pasturing ‘creepers’ (large bull-like creatures) and peacefully going about their business.\n\n\n\n  This planet is camouflaged by a F.A.K.K. 2 beacon and made to look like a biohazard-strewn wasteland in the hope that it will remain hidden from any threat. However, a creature named Gith, who appears only as a disembodied cybernetic head, runs a hyper-corporation called GITH Industries whose “employees” are little more than slaves. He scavenges the universe in a ship composed of three-quarters of a planet, and is headed for a place called Na’ChThraThull, or the “place of the soft machines”, which turns out to be Eden.\n\n\n\n  Julie resides in the town of Eden with her sister Kerrie, who is pregnant. She interacts with various citizens, including her brother-in-law, Germain St. Germain. Peace is suddenly disturbed by the appearance of hostile insect-like creatures called Vymishes. Julie springs into combat, killing many of the creatures and saving a pregnant creeper in the process. She also kills a Vymish Mama, a queen-like Vymish. Afterward, Julie heads into town and meets Otto, the town’s gunsmith, who she gives a glowing green asteroid to for examination. Another asteroid knocks out the shield, and Julie, accompanied by Jared and Eon, is tasked with resetting the shield generator. Underground, Julie’s accomplices are killed by creatures called Grawlix, and she is forced to continue alone. She eventually resets the shield generator, but is too late to discover that GITH has arrived, and he teleports troops in to destroy the generator.\n\n\n\n  Julie returns to town to find it under siege by GITH’s forces. Many citizens are dead, while others are hypnotized. Julie finds Otto, who has recovered a mysterious object from the asteroid. It turns out to be a message for Julie from the “Belphigoreans”, warning her that Gith is seeking the “Heart of the We”. Otto tells Julie about the Heart of the We, and tasks her with finding a native of Eden named Gruff. Julie leaves the besieged Eden, then journeys through the Mooagly swamps to find Gruff, who unlocks the path to the Temple of the We for her. She then overcomes the four challenges of the We before entering the final temple where the Heart of the We is kept. However, GITH is waiting for her, and he steals the Heart and uses it to bring Lord Tyler back to life, so he could have his revenge on Julie. However, Julie fights and kills Lord Tyler and wins the Heart, banishing GITH. She returns to town only to find out that her pregnant sister is kidnapped by GITH, who returns in a giant space station.\n\n\n\n\nI may have beaten this game, I actually don’t even remember. What I do remember, is my parent’s Pentium Gateway wasn’t powerful enough to play it at 60 FPS. In fact, I think I had a lot of issues just playing it. Which boggled my mind, because the PC ran Quake 3 very easily, and pretty well.\n\nHey, maybe that’s why the game isn’t really remembered all too well. But, it could also be because Ritual Entertainment sold themselves to a mobile game studio and then vanished, never to be heard from again.\n\nBut when it did work, it was a cool game. Running, gunning, slicing, platforming, and wild cinematics. Back in the day, I was a pretty big fan of the Heavy Metal magazine, and all the art that came with it. I think I remember watching Heavy Metal 2000, and trying to figure out how it fit into the timeline of the game … only to realize I glossed over the part where they say the game’s like, 30 years after 2000. It kind of makes me want to try and get it running on a modern Windows system, just to play through it one more time, so that I can clearly remember everything. And I say “Windows system,” because I already tried using Wine and Proton to make this game work on Linux, and it refused.\n\nBut this is just a long line of games from Ritual that are lost to history, and nearly lost-media. Just like SiN, and Emergence. I think the two latter games are more known and memorable, and some may even still be waiting for their continuation, but if you’re interested in preserving history, and gaming history, like me, you’d probably like to know this game existed at some point, and it should be resurrected. If only to have a spot on the internet archive.\n\nOh! It does have a spot there!\n\nAs of writing this, the internet archive is currently down due to a low-life who hacked and took the system down, but should be recovered at some point in the near future, so that my link to the FAKK 2 archive works.\n\nI write about this, though, partially, because I still miss the era of mid-90s and 2000s era gaming very much. Not for the porn-y aspects of gaming that were all over the place back then, but just because games were released faster, and there were so many different concepts, things people and studios were willing to try … until the never-ending profit machine of our modern society decided to generic-ise everything.\n\nAnyway, what the FAKK?\n"

Matt might be trying to bury Wordpress in a shallow grave, but maybe we can pretend that Tumblr has ActivityPub integration with some hacks.\n\nThe full script is over here on Github.\n\nNow, I don’t know for sure yet if this will capture more than one post. I currently have it setup on a cronjob that makes a post daily, and in my experimenting, it only seemed to grab the one post.

You are limited to the amount of times you can make an API call to Tumblr, per day, and this would very likely push you right over that limit, because, in order to do this, you have to make many, many API calls.\n\nI should also add a warning, I haven’t built-in any way to classify image posts, meaning, this could pull lewd or offensive content without warning, which is why I have it setup to always post with image sensitivity and a spoiler warning. I may look into figuring out implementing that later, along with possibly figuring out a way to have all my scripts give some kind of alt text to images (but I imagine that won’t be possible unless I implement AI, which I don’t think I want to do).\n\nEither way, enjoy!\n"

How this works, is that you pay me, give me the details of all the links you want on the page, plus any images, gifs, or other elements, and then I put it together. Once it’s assembled, I put it up on Neocities with a username of your choosing and a placeholder password (that you’ll have to change), and hand you the keys. Easy-peasy, and a great way to break free from monthly payments and contracts from the big corporations trying to sell this to you on a continuous basis.\n\nYou can see more about this, here.\n\nI also make music, and, funnily enough, it’s because of my offline job that my next album is taking me so long to complete. I’m really only a few tracks in, with ideas for more coming up. Regardless, I do have it on preorder, and will have to just keep adjusting that release date until it’s actually ready. Never-the-less, you can check out disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX, here.\n\nFinally, if you just like what I do, be it what I do with my website, or applications I develop, or what I do with music, or even Second Life, you can sign up on my Ko-fi, maybe even on a monthly basis! Find that link, here.\n\nI would also list my Second Life store marketplace here, but the pay from purchases on products within that store, and inside of Second Life, is so criminally low, it would only make a difference if someone bought everything in the store, all-at-once.\n\nEither way, thanks for stopping by and giving all of this a read–I’m going to go lay down until a request comes in~\n"

Everything’s a swiper, everyone’s making decisions based on appearances, and nothing else. Most of the accounts on these apps are like, 2% real people, and 98% bots, Instagram account spammers, scammers waiting for you in a motel with a baseball bat and some dude, and couples looking for a unicorn. It’s dire out there, brosefinas.\n\nBut there’s this one dating app that kind of emerged way back, and now they’re spending money for ad revenue, billing themselves as the app that’s not like the other apps, with ads that feature cartoon dudes talking about how all the other apps (Tinder, Bumble) are all about beauty pageants. How they’re not fun anymore, they’re all scams. How they keep swiping daily, more as a last-ditch hope that someday, they get lucky.\n\nIt’s aiming itself directly at lonely guys, and, okay, sure. There are a lot of lonely guys. And, I mean, some of them are lonely for good reason.\n\nI decided to give a shot, though. Because, hey, they’re not like the other apps, right?\n\nWrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s true: Most dating apps in 2024 are a scam. They don’t exist to match you with anyone. They don’t exist to be deleted. They exist to extract as much money as possible out of you, in the exploitation of your loneliness, and hopes of ever finding love. And with the way offline life has gone since the pandemic, meeting online is also becoming one of the only ways to … genuinely connect with someone.\n\nAccording to this National Academy of Sciences study.\n\n\n  In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Rosenfeld found that heterosexual couples are more likely to meet a romantic partner online than through personal contacts and connections. Since 1940, traditional ways of meeting partners – through family, in church and in the neighborhood – have all been in decline, Rosenfeld said.\n\n\n\n  Rosenfeld, a lead author on the research and a professor of sociology in the School of Humanities and Sciences, drew on a nationally representative 2017 survey of American adults and found that about 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting their partner online, compared to 22 percent in 2009. Sonia Hausen, a graduate student in sociology, was a co-author of the paper and contributed to the research.\n\n\nIt goes on to talk about how, with online dating, people have a much larger pool of potential partners to choose from, and this is basically why online dating has become the full and total norm (at least, if you’re fully straight, which I am not).\n\nSo … then why is there a loneliness epidemic? Why is this app titled “Boo” advertising itself by calling other apps scams.\n\nIt’s because, like I said, they are.\n\nBut Boo’s not much any better.\n\nSure, you can actually match with people, and potentially start conversations. You can select from a large amount of profile information to make matching easier. You can make posts as if you’re on some kind of social media website, and swipe left and right, just like on all the other apps.\n\nUntil they hit you with the, “36 dollars a month, please” ask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome to think of it … you can talk to people on Tinder. You can talk to people on Bumble.\n\nIt’s that, usually, when the time comes to talk, most people don’t. But that’s besides the point of the issue here.\n\nThe issue, is that these apps think they’re worth as much as Apple Premium, for almost no features.\n\nI’m sorry, but being able to continuously match with potential partners, and message to my heart’s content is not worth nearly the cost of two Doordash orders per month. It’s not worth the cost of a Crumbl cookie. It’s not worth the cost of running a 500 user Mastodon instance.\n\nPeople must actually be paying these fees for things you used to be able to do for free in 2012 on dating websites, and that’s just sad, dude. Stop paying these companies nearly 40 to 50 dollars a month, and go sign up for like, I don’t know, an anime box? A handful of streaming services? A monthly motel room to sit alone by yourself and watch TV on a foreign bed?\n\nDo anything, besides rewarding these soul-sucking companies for being machines of exploitation. And I’m talking about you, too, Boo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We’re not like the other apps.”\n\nYeah, you’re not.\n\nMost of the other apps aren’t trying to convince people they totally aren’t run by scum of the Earth, grifters.\n"

    "content": "I’ve been sitting here listening to Spotify most of the evening, browsing the social fediverse, and kind of thinking about things to write on this blog. Mostly because, I want to keep writing something almost every single day. You know, personal goals and such. And then I remembered old-school forum banter, and forums in-general. I’m currently a member of a few, but I rarely ever post. I guess new age social media has kind of taken my attention away from such things, unfortunately, but do you remember things like, sharing your wallpapers on a weekly basis? People just snapping photos of their desktops and being like, “Check it out dude.” Peppridge Farm remembers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot that anyone can really share anything on my personal site, but I wanted to get back into the tradition of things I used to do online, that I thought was really interesting and cool. Sharing my frikken’ wallpaper.\n\nI think about old forums, how I’d log on in the middle of class at tech while my teacher was trying to … teach me visual basic, and I’d just refresh, refresh, refresh. Kind of like how I refresh my timeline on social media sites nowadays, except I’m not sure what I was looking for back then. People responding to my posts, interesting things to reply to, friendships to make? Do we still make friends online, or are our followers an extension of acquaintanceship?\n\nI’ve thought about using part of the server I have rented over at Digital Ocean to slap down some roots for a modern forum, but would anyone even join? I know the Discourse software is pretty neat, and good, and I’d love to set it up, customize it, make it look neat, maybe even start up some kind of themed email list.\n\nBut, I feel like a lot of people have either forgotten forums, or the idea of it is so far away and in the past, that some may not even know what the heck I’m talking about.\n\n“What do you mean post static messages on a board that isn’t constantly flooding me with information overload, and engagement bait?”\n\nThen again, I guess Reddit is sort of a never-ending forum? Message board? Except it’s got random people on it that like to fight with you so that they can feel superior, for, … you know, reasons?\n\nI don’t know. I think back to the early 90s and how my Dad used to dial-in to bulletin boards to talk to people, and I get the feeling this is one of those lost “arts” of the internet that would be really hard to bring back, en masse. So many people posting on things like Tik Tok, which, I can never get used to. What do you mean you gotta share videos of yourself and be perceived at all times in order to participate? Have any of you ever heard of being introverted? Or just, writing text?\n\nMaybe it would be neat to make a new forum, even if it’s just for me.\n\nAnd maybe I’d post my wallpaper on a weekly basis, call it a public static journal.\n\nLike … like a blog?\n"

One of the reasons I briefly switched back to Windows, is because I wanted to do so, and couldn’t on Pop!_OS, despite having purchased pretty much every version of CoD since the original Black Ops 2. But, I ultimately decided that being able to play CoD wasn’t worth the trade-off of … using Windows. That was, until I realized I could play Modern Warfare III, and, presumably, Black Ops 6, on GeForce now. There is … an issue, though.\n\nIf you’re like me, and you just kind of install Debian, and all your essential apps and then forget about it, and then you load up GeForce Now thinking, “Hey, let’s play some FourthNite,” you’ll run into an issue. A weird issue. An annoying issue.\n\nYour mouse won’t move in a 360 degree rotation.\n\nAnd let me tell you, there are no resources online that are easily able to be Googled in order to solve this. In fact, I had to track down the GeForce Now flatpak author on Github, and then do some investigating in the issues specifically in relation to that version of the app. Needless to say, I found the answer. And it hadn’t ocurred to me, because, I guess Pop!_OS just does this by default, and that is therefore why I didn’t experience this problem.\n\nYou have to use Xorg/X11.\n\nGo to the login screen on Debian, click the gear at the bottom left, and choose Xorg. Do not use Wayland.\n\nI’m not all up in the discourse on Wayland, but this isn’t the only issue it has, and I totally forgot that it has problems.\n\nSuffice to say, I can now play Call of Duty on Linux, with minimal input lag via a streaming service. Which is pretty impressive. Albeit, I’m not much of an Nvidia fan (I use Radeon, after-all) due to them basically abandoning gaming and going all-in on melting the Earth’s icecaps by shipping trillions of cards specifically for use in machines that steal art from people, but whatever.\n\nUntil kernel level anticheat is made illegal, this is what you have to deal with unless you want to use a spyware OS (Windows).\n\nEither way, I wanted to write this down, and put it here, simply because there are very few resources in regards to this topic. But now there’s one, at least.\n"

While I sat waiting for a response to this ticket (which I’m still waiting on) I did what any normal person would do. I fully redesigned the way my website responds to different screens.\n\nThis is something that I would consider a major milestone in my web development journey, because, for all intents and purposes, you should be able to view it without issue even if you’re on an iPhone 3G. Now, does that mean my CSS is cleaned up and tidy, and there’s nothing left-over that shouldn’t be there? Absolutely not. There is a ton of stuff in there that probably isn’t currently being used, or is conflicting with something else … I just, haven’t had the energy to do all of that just yet.\n\nBut I will!\n\nAs you can see, on my to-do list.\n\nAnd, thankfully, I managed to achieve all of this without disrupting the flow of my little vanishing sidebar with all of my links.\n\nWhat prompted me to do this, though, were a few things. Someone I know on Mastodon tried visiting my website on a phone that is considerably older than an iPhone 15, and it bothered me that this person couldn’t quite see anything correctly, and there was some kind of invisible box blocking off half the content. Upon investigating a few days ago, utilizing the Vivaldi browser developer tools and device simulation, I was able to see exactly that.\n\nEw.\n\nBut, now, not only is that bar gone, or invisible box vaporized, but this website should display completely legibly on anything. Of course, I still have the specific media query setup for tiny screens in portrait mode, which I think works pretty well. But now, if you turn your phone or tablet sideways, it should look great, and give you a glimpse of everything a desktop user can see. Without issue. Hopefully.\n\nComment on this via the Mastodon link and let me know how it looks for you! Because of the nature of web development, I’m almost sure there’s someone out there who will have some kind of viewing issue. Maybe someone visiting my website from the screen-reader on their refrigerator. Who knows!\n\nBut anyway, what to do next? 😈\n"

So I logged the heck on.\n\nWhat I’ve missed, includes the Champions Ice Brood Saga quest, which seems to go on and on forever (so much so, that I’m taking a break and returning to it tomorrow).\n\nBut what I find kind of remarkable is that despite it being 2024, despite most things kind of … sucking ass, and a lot of MMOs and games in-general feeling repetitive, rehashed, polished to the point of being dull, and just not fun, Guild Wars 2 still feels fresh. It feels fresh in the sense that it’s like a portal back to 2014, when things were better. Not … the best, but better.\n\nI wish I could say the same about some of the communities outside of the game, and specifically via Reddit, and into Discord. It seems Reddit moderators are always out to ruin fun, and deploy control fantasies they don’t have the power to employ anywhere else. Being me, posting in the Guild Wars 2 discord asking some of the guilds if they’d be a good fit for me, and immediately getting slapped down and being told I needed to go use the guild recruitment subreddit.\n\nHey, Reddit mods: Have you ever considered that enforcing hefty restrictions on everything might not be the best way to go about things?

As most know, I shut down my city/the homestead a few months back. It’s really hard to justify spending 110+ USD a month on something that’s not making me any returns, and people really only visited on and off in short bursts. No fault of their own, I just mostly always lack the energy for reaching out and building community. But, my Second Life journey is also kind of empty and hollow without owning a piece of land, with things that I’ve built, so …\n\nI found some mainland that I like, I bought just enough that gives me nearly 3000 land impact that I could use, with my store being part of it (because my store has to come first, and must have an in-world location at all times), for a fairly much more decent price. It’s sustainable, and I can at least build something.\n\n\n\nI’ve done this a few times before with this place I call “THE DREDGE”, or, a smaller cut of Neo Machina, built to fit a piece of land that isn’t the size of a personal island. Both of the previous times I did it, it was cool, and people were visiting, but! … I went overboard, both times, and was paying for way more land than I needed, and therefore costing too much.\n\nI think I’ve nailed it this time, and am being a bit more methodical about it. Planning what I want to do, what I want to build. Surveying the land that already exists around the land that I do own, and looking at how I can make it look as though it’s connected to the rest of the community.\n\nI think I’m going to prop up the rentable apartment buildings, just so that people can have at it once again, but I may change it a bit. I remember complaints in the past about having such large spaces available, with small amounts of prims that could be placed, and it does make sense. Why have a huge livable space, but you can only place enough to fill the size of maybe like … a bedroom?\n\nSo, maybe I’ll build a new apartment building? We’ll see.\n\nI need to slap down some streets, get these placeholder prims replaced with actual buildings. Figure out what I want to do besides just offer a place for people to live if they should choose.\n\nDo I want to put my little nightclub back? Do I want to try and actually run it this time? Do I want to do something completely different and new?\n\nWhatever it is I decide I want to do, it’ll have to wait until tomorrow to get into real motion, because I have no time to myself tonight! Thank you … offline job.\n\nAnyway, that’s the update for now, denizens. I won’t be sharing a link to the land until it’s ready for people to actually visit (although, people who live around the area have already wandered inside to look at this cluster of white placeholders probably thinking, what the hell).\n"

    "content": "It’s been a little while since I’ve written down my impressions of a game. It’s been a little never that I’ve ever written down my initial impressions of a BioWare game. Thinking back, I think the last one that I played all the way through was Andromeda. Which was a good game, despite the meandering open world that took away from the experience. But, now we’re back, with the conclusion (maybe?) of the Inquisition timeline, and everything is purple, and very shiny. These are my thoughts …\n\nBack in the day, way back, only a couple years after the iPhone was released, and after Mass Effect was released, I played my first BioWare game. That’s right, I didn’t play Mass Effect 1 until after I beat Dragon Age: Origins. In 2009. This was a dicey period in my life, when I was living in numerous places that I moved from every three years. But the one thing that didn’t change, was that I was constantly gaming.\n\nBut anyway, fast forward to now, 2024, and it’s been legitimately ten years since I’ve beaten Inquisition. Hardly remember a thing I did in that game aside from romancing Sera on my elven mage, which you can see in the “scrap” page under my links within the hide-away link panel on this site. When I say these are my initial impressions, I mean, I played the game for 6.9 hours, and felt I had enough to go on to write something.\n\nRight from the jump, I’m in character creation and taking my time, and the game suddenly slows to a slog, and eventually locks up. This caused me to have to restart my PC. I load up the game again in order to continue, and I notice some random slowdown here and there, but I force my way through and make it into the initial start of the game. You know, that opening piece BioWare showcased months and months ago. Cut scenes started locking up, and the same freezing was happening, so I took the graphic settings down from high, to medium, and this seemed to help greatly.\n\nNote: I’m on Debian using the Gnome desktop environment under Wayland, if that’s anything to go by. So, yes, I’m using Steam’s Proton layer in order to run this game.\n\nSince, at the end of character creation, BioWare has you basically … recreate your Inquisitor, and asks you a couple of very basic questions about your choices in the previous game, I’m all set and assuming my Inquisitor is about to show up.\n\nNo.\n\n6.9 hours in, and I have not seen my Inquisitor even once, yet. This seems strange to me, because my Inquisitor was one of the people setting off to find Solas. And then we start Veilguard with just Varric, and some brand new people? Varric is the one who has managed to track Solas down, and me, with my fresh face, and some other people (okay, Harding isn’t a brand new face, but …) and we’re running up on him.\n\nWhere is the Inquisitor?\n\nWhere’s Hawke? Where the hell is my Grey Warden? And what are the consequences of my having fed the prisoner in Dragon Age: Origins?\n\n** SPOILERS AHEAD **\n\nMorrigan returns, albeit briefly, so far, and it’s looking like, since she divulged all the information she could about your grey warden in the previous game, any thoughts on that subject this time around may not ever be revisited.\n\nI could be proven wrong on this, but I don’t expect to be.\n\n** END SPOILERS **\n\nExpectations aside, alright, let’s just play the game.\n\nI push through the initial mission, then the second one, then the third one, then the fourth one, and I’m getting a little afraid that this game is just mission-to-mission gaming, and there’s no longer even any sense of exploration whatsoever.\n\nYou have a home-base, and places to speak to your team, so there’s that. At least that is some semblance of what Dragon Age once was. But it’s not until hours and hours into the game that you’re suddenly met with the world map, the many places you have to visit, the option to take side quests, and the ability to simply teleport somewhere, and explore.\n\nAlright, so that aspect of Dragon Age is not dead, and is in fact alive and well. Kind of the way it was in Origins, funnily enough.\n\nThere was another time the game crashed, right around the fifth hour mark, and it was strange, because my videocard abruptly said “Nope” and then I was sent to my login screen? As if my PC did a stealth restart right then and there?\n\nBioWare, you’ve got some patching to do, or something.\n\nI’m enjoying it so far, though, at least. It’s a bit lighter on the atmosphere, the writing is … okay. It could use some updating. Like, the story is there, and there are gradual dripfeeds of previous content being given to you, but a lot of the writing leaves a little bit to be desired. But it’s at least fun.\n\nDoes it feel like Dragon Age?\n\nThat’s hard to say. It’s been so long since I’ve been immersed in the world, I hardly remember what it was like.\n\nI remember the first time I played Origins. The concept of romancing characters in a game, completely alien to me.\n\nMeeting Morrigan, finding the approval ratings. Trying to figure out how to make her like me the best, and then suddenly she was having my child.\n\nAnd then there was Hawke, me wandering around this strange place, trying to figure out why I wasn’t allowed to continue my story of starting a family with Morrgian, and then slowly but surely getting used to the idea that BioWare didn’t want me to have that.\n\nYears passed, and Inquisition came, and mentally, I was a completely different person. Morrigan was there with a few things to say about her apparent grey warden husband, father of her child, disappearing … somewhere.\n\nYeah, I have a long history with this franchise.\n\nThere was also a point that I actually expected to play the Inquisitor in Veilguard. I know all of the reasons, and have heard all of the points as to why it is the way it is right now, but to me, it still would have made sense to just continue that story.\n\nAlas, BioWare says, “Nah.”\n\nIf we’re talking feeling disoriented, sprinting through the first six hours of the game trying to find some semblance of the past that I can connect my character to, and seeing some familiar faces and going “Oh shoot!” and just splattering every enemy in front of me with massive power, then … yes, absolutely. It feels like Dragon Age.\n\nBut where is my son.\n"

    "content": "Today I got off of work, sat down on my couch, and promptly passed the heck out. Then, I woke up, and ate an italian sub. This was just enough fuel for me to load up VS Code and get back to messing with my website. As you can probably see, if you’re reading this from the page itself, I’ve made some … upgrades.\n\n\n\nObviously, I already detail some of what I do in my changelog, in regards to major changes, but I wanted to write up a post about it, because this site is making huge leaps in progress (ever since I redesigned the CSS in order to make this place much more responsive to various screens that people use). And, for being a completely static site built on the Jekyll foundation, you can hardly even tell that’s what it is.\n\nFirstly, if you look to the right, you’ll see the Mastodon feed. For the longest time, this was just disjointed text with separators. You could only tell that it was coming from my Mastodon posts, because I had some text that said “mkultra feed” up above it. Despite how much I appreciate the original author of the script, I’ve been wanting to alter it so that it’s much more obvious it’s coming from Mastodon, or a social media website, in-general.\n\nSo, I did.\n\nI would upload this to GitHub, but I don’t remember who the author was, and I don’t want to just upload a modified version of their script without asking first.\n\nNow, you’ll see that my actual Mastodon account information is linked to each post, as it updates live! If you click on the post date, this will then take you to the actual post itself, on my instance.\n\nSecondly, I have a calendar on the right side of the page further down below this Mastodon feed. I mostly added this for flavor, because I noticed some sites in the indie web and Neocities sphere had little calendars, and rather than steal one, I decided to make one myself. But, in order to make it unique, and fun, I wanted to add some additional flavor to that as well.\n\nIt had some issues at first, but I’ve managed to setup some JavaScript in order to pull random top 100 images from the subreddit “/r/animewallpaper” in order to show a random image in the background, upon load. This is, semi, sort of using the Reddit API. And no, I’m not paying them a single dime in order to make this happen.\n\nNext, as most who keep up with my blog will know, I’ve written python scripts that do numerous things. Such as pulling the top 5 trending posts from specific subreddits, and sending me an email of what’s trending, each morning. Another script that generates random text and then posts to Mastodon, based on a database of my own Mastodon posts backed up from the start of 2024, to now. And then, of course, we have my reddit-bot script that pulls from a list of my favorite subreddits and posts a random trending image to both Mastodon, and Tumblr.\n\nIn order to integrate this into my webpage, so that my work has some kind of permanence outside of social networks where it may not be as easily seen, I’ve written some JavaScript that utilizes Tumblr API to create a live feed of the posts that reddit-bot makes specifically to my Tumblr account (because that’s mostly the only thing I use it for nowadays, and it didn’t make sense to me to put multiple Mastodon account feeds on my site). You can see, over on the left side of the page, that it displays the exact text that’s posted to Tumblr whenever the bot makes its call, with images in-tact.\n\nFinally, and this is a change many may not ever notice. I’ve written a modal that is used specifically and only on my haxPunks page. If you haven’t ever visited it, basically, back in 2022 I was making NFTs, and it made me a little money … it’s why I have some of the tech that I currently do. Despite all that money being gone, it helped me a lot in a period of my life where I was recovering from semi-self isolation that I put myself through for years. And, even though I’ve mostly stepped away from NFTs due to the volatile and toxic nature of the subculture, I still make little pixel people here and there when I feel like it (completely disconnected from the world of NFTs, despite them existing on the OpenSea blockchain).\n\nBut, I wanted the page to be more dynamic and fun to look at.\n\nThis modal makes it so that when you click an image of one of the pixel-people I’ve drawn, it blows it up on the screen without ever leaving the page, and gives you not only a better look, but also a description that’s derived from the alt text (I’m still working on writing a description for all of them, so upon posting this, only Charlotte with have a description).\n\nThat’s most of what I’ve done today, but I can still feel the itch to do even more. What that “more” entails, is entirely up to what my brain decides, whenever it comes to me.\n\nBut hey, thanks for reading!\n"

    "content": "So, like you do, I got home from work, and immediately dove back into the code machine, i.e., my monstrous PC that I primarily use for writing website stuff, or python scripts, and sometimes playing Dragon Age and Baldur’s Gate.\n\nMy first objective, was to see if I could fully automate my dead Twitter account to just post stuff with a script utilizing the free API tier that they offer for personal use. After much hacking around, and finding out that it’s mostly restrictive, and using multiple version of OAuth, I decided it’s not worth it. Not worth it to figure out, and not worth it to maintain for a website that’ll probably be dead in like six months.\n\nThen, I moved on to Threads. Surely they have an API that can just toss me some keys and let me use Python to post a bunch of random stuff to my timeline so that I can further automate what I’m posting and doing on corporate owned social media.\n\nNo!\n\nOr, at least, I haven’t quite figured it out, because it’s about as complicated as the Twitter API.\n\nThat’s in the garbage for now as well.\n\nBut then, I was on my Mastodon instance, and I realized, “Hey, that reddit bot script I wrote repeats itself a lot. I think it’d do better to choose from any images posted to my fave subreddits, and maybe also like … keep a log file of what’s already been posted? So it stops posting the same things on a daily basis?”\n\nAnd that’s what I did.\n\nI massively simplified the code, and set it up so that it keeps a log file.\n\nFirst, we import all the stuff we need\n\nimport os\nimport random\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport praw\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom mastodon import Mastodon\nimport pytumblr\nimport tempfile\n\n\nWe wanna use “random” to select random images, json to save the URLs for already posted images to a file in order to reference later, pillow to optimize the images so that it isn’t all crappily crap once posted to Mastodon and Tumblr, and of course all the other essentials needed to make this work (like pytumblr and mastodon, gotta have those if we want to post).\n\nThen we slap on some configuration. As far as API keys go, you need them all.\n\n\n # Configuration\nSUBREDDITS = ['Animewallpaper', 'ZeroTwo', 'BlueArchive', 'ZenlessZoneZero', 'Edgerunners', 'BaldursGate3', 'BokuNoHeroAcademia', 'ChainsawMan', 'backrooms', 'AnimeGirls', 'animeART', 'liminalspace', 'evangelion', 'abandonwareDOS', 'himikotoga', 'SFWmonstergirls', 'MotokoKusanagi', 'Churchofzerotwo', 'ChurchofMarnie', 'PokeGals', 'CuteAnimeGirls', 'UnixPorn', 'RebeccasPlace', 'AnimeSketch']\nLOG_FILE = 'posted_images.json'\nIMAGE_LIMIT = 50\nMASTODON_INSTANCE_URL = 'https://your_instace.url'\nMASTODON_CLIENT_ID = 'mastodon_client_id'\nMASTODON_CLIENT_SECRET = 'client_secret_masto'\nMASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'masto_access_token'\nTUMBLR_CONSUMER_KEY = 'consumer_key_from_tumblr_app'\nTUMBLR_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'the_consumer_secret'\nTUMBLR_OAUTH_TOKEN = 'the_oauth_token_you_generate'\nTUMBLR_OAUTH_SECRET = 'the_oauth_secret_key'\nREDDIT_CLIENT_ID = 'reddit_client_id'\nREDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET = 'reddit_client_secret'\nREDDIT_USER_AGENT = 'name_of_the_reddit_app'\nCUSTOM_TEXT = \"Some custom text to post along with each that goes out to Mastodon and Tumblr\"\nTUMBLR_BLOG_NAME = 'nova-ayashi' # This is where the name of your Tumblr blog goes\n\n\nAs you can see, this is where we want to list our favorite subreddits, then tell it what the log file to generate should be called, and how many images it should look at at once. We don’t want to set it much higher than 50 because you’re going to DDOS your own damn self and probably hit a rate limit somewhere.\n\nAfter you’ve decided what to input in those fields, you’re going to want to go through the lengthy process of obtaining your Mastodon keys, creating a Reddit app (for personal use, so they don’t charge you money), and then the Tumblr app. Generating the Tumblr OAuth keys can be done within VS Code, just use localhost as your redirect URI.\n\nNext, we want to load any posted images, if there are any.\n\n\ndef load_posted_images():\n    if os.path.exists(LOG_FILE):\n        with open(LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:\n            return json.load(f)\n    return []\n\n\nThen create the posted images json.\n\n\ndef save_posted_image(image_url):\n    posted_images = load_posted_images()\n    posted_images.append(image_url)\n    with open(LOG_FILE, 'w') as f:\n        json.dump(posted_images, f)\n\n\nNow, look at a random subreddit from your list! 🤩\n\n\ndef get_random_subreddit():\n    return random.choice(SUBREDDITS)\n\n\nAnd make sure it gets a nice high resolution image so that it doesn’t post some pixelated looking poop.\n\n\ndef get_high_res_image_url(submission):\n    if submission.url.endswith(('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png')):\n        return submission.url\n    if hasattr(submission, 'preview'):\n        images = submission.preview.get('images', [])\n        if images:\n            resolutions = images[0].get('resolutions', [])\n            if resolutions:\n                return resolutions[-1]['url']\n    return None\n\n\nNow, here comes the fun part. We’re going to take the random subreddit we just chose earlier, and we’re going to tell the script to retry if it doesn’t find anything, and when it does, append the URL to the json so that it’s permanently saved as something that’s already been posted. I had this issue before where the script kept repeating itself over and over again, essentially spamming timelines with duplicate content.\n\n\ndef get_random_photo_from_subreddit(reddit, subreddit_name):\n    subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)\n    image_submissions = [submission for submission in subreddit.new(limit=IMAGE_LIMIT) if submission.url.endswith(('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png'))]\n\n\n    if not image_submissions:\n        return get_random_photo_from_subreddit(reddit, subreddit_name)  # retry\n    else:\n        posted_images = load_posted_images()\n        random_submission = random.choice(image_submissions)\n        image_url = get_high_res_image_url(random_submission)\n\n\n        while image_url in posted_images:\n            random_submission = random.choice(image_submissions)\n            image_url = get_high_res_image_url(random_submission)\n\n        \n        save_posted_image(image_url)\n        return random_submission, image_url\n\n\nOnce the script has chosen an image, we want to save it to the server. Just because we feel like it, f#ck it.\n\n\ndef download_and_optimize_image(image_url):\n    response = requests.get(image_url)\n    temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.jpg')\n    temp_file.write(response.content)\n    temp_file.close()\n\n\n    image = Image.open(temp_file.name)\n    image = image.convert('RGB')\n    image.save(temp_file.name, optimize=True, quality=85)\n    return temp_file.name\n\n\nAnd already, we’re posting! For Mastodon, we’re going to use a sensitive marker so that we don’t hit everyone in the face with something that could be potentially distressing or lewd. This is Reddit we’re pulling from, after-all.\n\n\ndef post_to_mastodon(mastodon_client, image_path, status_text):\n    media = mastodon_client.media_post(image_path)\n    mastodon_client.status_post(status_text, media_ids=[media], sensitive=True)\n\n\nOnce the fediverse has been graced by anime pythons, we’re going to hit Tumblr next. Except for Tumblr, we’re going to use the subreddit name as a hashtag so that it’s categorized and easier to find, since Tumblr still heavily uses hashtags.\n\n\ndef post_to_tumblr(tumblr_client, image_path, status_text, tags):\n    tumblr_client.create_photo(TUMBLR_BLOG_NAME, state=\"published\", tags=tags, data=image_path, caption=status_text)\n\n\nNote: I do not endorse Photo Matt and his crusade against his own company and software, nor do I endorse transphobia he expressed earlier in 2024.\n\nIn order to make sure everything does what it’s supposed to do, we need to define the main function. This is where we check all the API keys and what-not, optimize the image, and tell the script what exactly it is we want to say along with the image that’s being posted (aside from the custom text already defined in the configuration). Once all that’s done, we need to make sure we delete that image from the server, because we definitely don’t want to have 40,000 anime girl images eating your hdd space.\n\n\ndef main():\n    reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, client_secret=REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET, user_agent=REDDIT_USER_AGENT)\n    mastodon_client = Mastodon(\n        access_token=MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN,\n        api_base_url=MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL\n    )\n    tumblr_client = pytumblr.TumblrRestClient(\n        TUMBLR_CONSUMER_KEY,\n        TUMBLR_CONSUMER_SECRET,\n        TUMBLR_OAUTH_TOKEN,\n        TUMBLR_OAUTH_SECRET\n    )\n\n\n    subreddit_name = get_random_subreddit()\n    submission, image_url = get_random_photo_from_subreddit(reddit, subreddit_name)\n    image_path = download_and_optimize_image(image_url)\n\n\n    mastodon_status_text = f\"{CUSTOM_TEXT}\\n\\n░ Posted by: u/{submission.author}\\n░ Subreddit: r/{subreddit_name}\\n░ Title: [{submission.title}]({submission.url})\"\n    tumblr_status_text = f\"{CUSTOM_TEXT}░ Posted by: u/{submission.author}░ Subreddit: r/{subreddit_name}░ Title: < a href='{submission.url}'>{submission.title}< /a>░ Github: < a href='https://github.com/cmdr-nova'>cmdr_nova</ a>\" # you can make this a link to something else, but for me it's my personal github\n    tumblr_tags = [\"image\", subreddit_name]\n\n\n    post_to_mastodon(mastodon_client, image_path, mastodon_status_text)\n    post_to_tumblr(tumblr_client, image_path, tumblr_status_text, tumblr_tags)\n\n\n    os.remove(image_path)\n\n\nThe reason we have Mastodon and Tumblr in separate functions is because they have different requirements for formatting posts. Mastodon supports markdown, while Tumblr operates on basic HTML in its posts. If we send the Mastodon version of the post text to Tumblr, you’ll get a non-formatted mess that sucks to look at and has no linking. So, what we do instead, is define two different types of posts!\n\nNow we just make sure that it only runs when the file is executed.\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\nAnd that’s that! I remember when I used to be a heavy-gamer. Playing Call of Duty and World of Warcraft for 14 hours at a time and then going to work on an hour and a half of sleep. But, no more! Now I stare at text on my computer screen and grow ever-more-blind in a pair of glasses that probably need their prescription updated. No matter. I hope this script is useful to others, rather than just me, with a special interest in flooding social media with Python experiments.\n\nThe reason I’ve decided to post the code here, rather than Github, is because I thought it’d be more fun to break it all down and talk about it. There doesn’t really seem to be a whole lot of conversation that happens on Github, and pretty much almost nobody even follows me there. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nEither way …\n\nEnjoy!\n"

I got home, and yes, instead of watching the new Deadpool, I switch on the code machine and thought, “Why am I routing the Tumblr API through a github secret only to get static results that don’t update unless I push changes to my site? The heck?” And I thought, “What if I just use a proxy server on my VPS that the JavaScript accesses to give a fresh perspective every time someone refreshes my site?” Boy … oh boy.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, everything is setup correctly. I have a proxy server running perfectly, and certificates, and nginx blasting on all fours. But then I load the website, I check the developer console and …\n\nYOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED BY CORS, WHERE THE HEADERS MAN?\n\nAnd me, crying and screaming, and pounding my fists into a pillow, “THE HEADERS ARE RIGHT THERE IN THE SERVER. THEY’RE RIGHT THERE BRO. WHAT CAN’T YOU READ?”\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever driven myself quite this mad trying to post some dymanic updates from a bot to my website before. But I think it’s definitely because I’m so tired I feel dizzy.\n\nThere’s probably a very simple solution, and maybe it’s because I was running a local copy of my website alongside the live version and maybe that was making CORS go “DUDE,” but I think I’ll figure that out later.\n\nI think I’ve had enough of seeing the phrase “CORS.”\n\nI’m never going to drink a certain kind of beer again, at least.\n\nI mean, I really don’t need to have this on my site. In fact, I bet I could find a way to just have the bot post something into a div onto my site with JavaScript and that VPS where I’m running a proxy.\n\nBut, uh, I’m just gonna go to sleep.\n\nThanks for reading my vent.\n"

But hey! My feed looks REALLY COOL.\n\nNova Feed\n\nAside from dropping everything I’ve mostly ever written online, directly onto Mastodon, I also made some updates to the site.\n\nI was struggling with the CORS proxy for about 10 hours, with a break for sleep in-between, and I finally figured it out. Now the Tumblr feed of my bot posting on the left sidebar is working correctly, and updating without the need for the site to be rebuilt.\n\nI’ve also added something pretty neat to the right sidebar, directly under my haxPunks … A list of trending topics from Mastodon! Which, when you click on a topic, you can then view who’s posting about and within that hashtag via your own Mastodon instance.\n\nI may not really be able to figure out how to turn a Jekyll site into something that’s fully federated, but I can make it look like it is!\n\nAside from all of that, I just wanted to quickly apologize to the people who got slapped hard with all of my posts … three times.

    "content": "It’s been a hell of a time! Earlier in the week, I suddenly had an issue where I broke my RSS feed bot that posted new feed items from my blog to my Mastodon account. I described this in my last post, but it was entirely because I … edited the XML. So! I spent the last entire day rebuilding a brand new way to do this. By turning VS Code’s “commit” button into a “Post to Mastodon” button. Let me explain.\n\nI’ve been using “Deploy to Neocities” for a while, so I had a basis to work with already. I figured, all I’d have to do … is tell Github to build the site, and then construct the URL from what it would usually be on my website.\n\nThe next thing I had to make it do, was SSH into my VPS, because you can’t run Python on Neocities.\n\nMy first attempt was to work with a custom Ruby plugin, and have that build the post content, and then send it along with the constructed URL to a Python script on my VPS that would then jumble it all together and post it. But that didn’t work. Because Jekyll apparently does not like custom Rubies … I guess?\n\nAlso, if that sounds really convoluted and a round-a-about way of doing things, that’s because it is.\n\nSo, I went to sleep, then I went to work. And I mulled it over in my head, “Why not just have the build process construct the URL, look for new posts, and then dump it into the pipeline to your server, where it’s constructed, and posted.”\n\nBehold.\n\n\n    - name: Check for new posts\n      id: check_new_posts\n      run: |\n        new_post=false\n        post_url=\"\"\n        current_date=$(TZ=America/New_York date +%Y-%m-%d)\n        base_url=\"https://nova.mkultra.monster\"\n        echo \"Current date: $current_date\"\n        for file in $(git log --diff-filter=A --name-only HEAD); do\n          echo \"Checking file: $file\"\n          if [[ $file == _posts/* ]]; then\n            echo \"File is in _posts directory\"\n            post_date=$(basename $file | cut -d'-' -f1-3)\n            post_year=$(basename $file | cut -d'-' -f1)\n            post_month=$(basename $file | cut -d'-' -f2)\n            post_day=$(basename $file | cut -d'-' -f3)\n            post_title=$(basename $file | cut -d'-' -f4- | sed 's/\\.md$//')\n            post_category=$(grep -m 1 '^categories:' $file -A 1 | tail -n 1 | sed 's/- //;s/\"//g;s/ //g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')\n            echo \"Post date: $post_date\"\n            echo \"Post category: $post_category\"\n            echo \"Current date: $current_date\"\n            if [[ $post_date == $current_date ]]; then\n              new_post=true\n              post_url=\"$base_url/$post_category/$post_year/$post_month/$post_day/$post_title.html\"\n              echo \"New post detected: $post_url\"\n              break\n            else\n              echo \"Post date does not match current date\"\n            fi\n          else\n            echo \"File is not in _posts directory\"\n          fi\n        done\n        echo \"new_post=$new_post\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n        echo \"post_url=$post_url\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n        echo \"Post URL: $post_url\"\n\n\n    - name: Start SSH agent\n      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3\n      with:\n        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}\n\n\n    - name: Post to Mastodon\n      if: env.new_post == 'true'\n      env:\n        MASTODON_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_API_KEY }}\n        POST_URL: ${{ env.post_url }}\n      run: |\n        echo \"Posting to Mastodon: ${POST_URL}\"\n        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no root@my_vps_ip \"source ~/masto-poast/masto-poast-env/bin/activate && MASTODON_API_KEY=${{ secrets.MASTODON_API_KEY }} python3 ~/masto-poast/poast.py '${POST_URL}'\"\n\n\nBut wait! THERE’S MORE!\n\n\n\nThe code above is everything Jekyll does by itself on Github until it reaches the point it can do no more, because static sites are a bit limited. But that’s okay! Static sites are great! But … for what we’re doing, we need to connect to my VPS, which is accomplished easily at the end of the build process.\n\nOnce connected, it activates the environment, and then runs the Python script, which is as follows.\n\n                                                                        \nimport os\nimport sys\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n\nMASTODON_API_URL = 'https://mkultra.monster/api/v1/statuses'\nACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv('MASTODON_API_KEY')\nPOSTED_URLS_FILE = 'posted_urls.txt'\n\n\ndef extract_summary_and_tag(post_url):\n    response = requests.get(post_url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n\n    # Extract the second < p > tag within the #main div as a summary\n    main_div = soup.find('div', {'id': 'main'})\n    if main_div:\n        paragraphs = main_div.find_all('p')\n        summary = paragraphs[1].get_text() if len(paragraphs) > 1 else \"No summary available\"\n    else:\n        summary = \"No summary available\"\n\n    \n    # Extract the tag from the < span > within the #main div\n    tag_span = None\n    if main_div:\n        for span in main_div.find_all('span'):\n            if 'tag:' in span.get_text().lower():\n                tag_span = span\n                break\n\n    \n    if tag_span:\n        tag_link = tag_span.find('a')\n        if tag_link:\n            tag = tag_link.get_text(strip=True)\n            print(f\"Extracted tag: {tag}\")\n        else:\n            tag = \"\"\n            print(\"No < a > tag found within < span >\")\n    else:\n        tag = \"\"\n        print(\"No < span > tag found with 'tag:' text\")\n\n\n    hashtag = f\"#{tag.replace(' ', '').lower()}\" if tag else \"\"\n\n\n    return summary, hashtag\n\n\ndef post_to_mastodon(content):\n    headers = {\n        'Authorization': f'Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}',\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n    }\n    data = {\n        'status': content\n    }\n    response = requests.post(MASTODON_API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)\n    print(f'Request URL: {MASTODON_API_URL}')\n    print(f'Request Headers: {headers}')\n    print(f'Request Data: {data}')\n    print(f'Response Status Code: {response.status_code}')\n    print(f'Response Text: {response.text}')\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        print('Successfully posted to Mastodon')\n    else:\n        print(f'Error posting to Mastodon: {response.status_code} - {response.text}')\n\n\ndef has_been_posted(post_url):\n    if not os.path.exists(POSTED_URLS_FILE):\n        return False\n    with open(POSTED_URLS_FILE, 'r') as file:\n        posted_urls = file.read().splitlines()\n    return post_url in posted_urls\n\n\ndef mark_as_posted(post_url):\n    with open(POSTED_URLS_FILE, 'a') as file:\n        file.write(post_url + '\\n')\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n        print('Usage: python poast.py \"Post URL\"')\n        sys.exit(1)\n    post_url = sys.argv[1]\n    print(f'Received post URL: {post_url}')\n\n    \n    if has_been_posted(post_url):\n        print(f'Post URL has already been posted: {post_url}')\n        sys.exit(0)\n\n    \n    summary, hashtag = extract_summary_and_tag(post_url)\n    post_content = f\"Today on Nova Prime: {post_url}\\n\\n{summary}\\n\\n{hashtag}\"\n    print(f'Constructed post content: {post_content}')\n\n    \n    post_to_mastodon(post_content)\n    mark_as_posted(post_url)\n\n\nAs you can see, all sensitive information is being stored, somewhere else. In Github secrets! Which are injected into the Python script upon connection.\n\nBut, what this does, is it basically creates this situation where, now, my blog is kind of, sort of, federated? Not really, but it acts that way. Whenever I write a new post, and hit commit, the site builds, and then my account posts the generated matter. It’s as if my Mastodon account is now inside of VS Code. Which it totally could be! … if I wanted to post everything I write to Mastodon in links to my blog.\n\nI lost a little sleep over this. I went to bed late last night, and then I woke up early to do more troubleshooting, and then I went to work with bags under my eyes, and then I came home, tired as all hell. And I kept going.\n\nAnd now it’s done\n\nIt works.\n\nEnjoy.\n"

    "content": "The day’s coming to an end (okay, actually, it’s like 12:30 at night, it’s been over), and I’ve done a lot. In my last post I talked about spending all of my free time over the course of 24 hours making a function that pushes my blog posts to Mastodon. Well, after all of that, I went to bed, woke up, and started on something new …\n\nAlmost half of my day was spent fixing and upgrading the haxPunks page on this website.\n\nBasically, I noticed that the image modal was not only opening within its parent div (main), but also producing a scrollbar WITHIN that div, and it was very clunky and bad looking. So, the goal was to figure out a better way to do it. And then I stumbled into problems, where I had a position set in one of the CSS elements, and because of that one freakin’ thing, the modal would not stop opening and showing on page load.\n\nThis also looked bad.\n\nAnd it took me HOURS to notice what I did wrong.\n\nBut I fixed it.\n\nAnd I got the modal functioning correctly.\n\nAnd I formatted it to work nicely on mobile (I think).\n\nThen, it was done.\n\nAfter that, I took a look at what is now the Second Life page, and decided to delete everything I’d written in there, and made something new. It showcases my store, and then my land. No big story about where I came from, where I’m going, how things went wrong, and where we’re at now.\n\nJust the stuff that currently exists. Which is good, I think. So people don’t have to read a history book about why I’ve done what I’ve done, and what my goals are.\n\nBut I wasn’t finished after that. I needed to do more.\n\nI took to Gimp, opened OBS, and recorded my process of making a haxPunk, and then uploaded the video, plus the result (to the haxPunks page). Yes, you will notice in the video there’s a “generative” layer, and that’s entirely because this is a PSD from when I was still subscribed to Photoshop, and totally innocently looking at what exactly the feature did (lol).\n\nBut, here’s that video:\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the punk:\n\n\n\nAs you can probably tell, I’ve modeled this one after the current version of my Second Life avatar, and I think it turned out pretty neat.\n\nI’ve been making these things since before I said, “Wait a minute, NFTs are stupid.” But the thing is, I enjoyed the process of making them so much, that even after exiting the whole “NFT” thing, I wanted to keep making them. I’ve had these going for a long time, and I want to make hundreds of them. Just for fun.\n\nLately, that’s pretty much the reason I do most things. On my website, on Github, or through Python on my VPS. I just enjoy doing this stuff!\n\nIf at some point I happen to get paid to do any of it, hey, that’s awesome (please pay me to do these things at some point oh my god please).\n\nJust kidding\n\n… unless?\n"

Today, it’s juicy green shorts!\n\n\n\nThis is the second to last pair of shorts in the Nano Nexus set, and then I move on to … some other piece of clothing! And hopefully end up releasing it in a standard amount of time that is absolutely not equal to an entire year.\n\nYou can view them on the digital marketplace, or come and see them in-world at the store itself.\n\nSpeaking of millions of other things I work on, in unrelated news, I put together an RSS feed element for my website that reads my Bluesky feed, and then slapped it onto Github for others to check out and potentially use. You can see that here. Basically, it grabs the RSS feed of your profile (on Bluesky), bounces it off of a proxy so that it doesn’t spit out a ton of CORS errors, and then displays your most recent three posts. And, it updates with each page refresh!\n\nEasy peasy.\n\nI’ve also made it so new posts from this website also go to my Bluesky account, and since I haven’t really tested it yet, this post should hopefully get there safely. We’ll see.\n\nBut, until my next release, or hacked code update, or random thought, have a good one!\n"

    "content": "I’ve had some criticisms of Bluesky, ever since it opened. Albeit, I had some bad experiences with some users who seem to have also been chased off of the platform for the way they treat others. But, I also have been skeptical about its mode of decentralization (where is it?), and them being VC backed, and recently funded by a crypto company. But, things are changing …\n\nThey’re changing, because the social media landscape is changing. And I don’t mean, “Musk took over Twitter, so we probably have to go somewhere else” in a means of changing, but more like, “All corporate social media with lax moderation methods run by billionaires is probably a good idea to flee from.”\n\nAnd, for me, personally, looking at potentially everything becoming more expensive, and my bad experiences with being on Mastodon instances that aren’t owned by me personally, I’m looking at what I may need to do in the future.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love the fediverse. But I have had to leave at least five different instances due to unjust banning, or extremely overzealous moderators who seek power in a digital space in order to a fill a void where they have none.\n\nAnd for me, that’s a problem.\n\nI’m a creator, I run a website, and now I also run a server with numerous scripts that showcase what I have, and can do. I run a digital “business” in Second Life, and I’m working simultaneously on an album and a novel. I’m a developer, a webmaster, a writer, and a sound designer, and I can’t put my future, and potential future career in the hands of people who could silence me at a moment’s notice, just because I, for example, said “fuck off” to a troll.\n\nYeah, I’m still talking about the hackers.town incident.\n\nCall me jaded, but I just don’t know if I can trust admins of a fediverse instance to not screw me over, since this is something that has happened to me, over and over.\n\nNow, that’s not to say Bluesky doesn’t have methods of silencing people for no reason. They have public blocklists. But! What these blocklists can’t do, is erase your entire online presence in a matter of minutes.\n\nAnd that’s where I find myself at a theoretical future crossroads where, suddenly, maybe I can’t pay 40 some dollars a month upkeep on my personal Mastodon instance, and I have to look at the alternatives.\n\nAlbeit, Wafrn, and Kitsunes.club are decent enough fediverse servers, and their admins haven’t clobbered me out of existence (which would suck, because I’m also a partial admin/moderator on Wafrn), for one reason or another, they just feel like an extension of my online identity, rather than one that’s central. This isn’t a criticism of either of these places, but more probably just me being … weird. I don’t know. Owning my own Mastodon instance has given me a feeling of real control over how people interact with, and also perceive me online. And on something like Bluesky, I can sort of also achieve that, by forwarding my domain to my username, and redirecting my little bots to separate accounts (which I’ve already done).\n\nThe thing is, I’m probably way overthinking all of this, but in this bout of turmoil I’m experiencing, Bluesky has grown on me a bit. I’ve figured out how to use “feeds” to create my own “algorithm” and I’ve setup some placeholder moderation lists, and it feels … okay. It could feel alright, if, for some reason, I suddenly have to move there.\n\nBut … maybe I just haven’t given Wafrn or Kitsunes enough of a chance to be central to my online identity.\n\nWhat I do know, is that it’s important to have control over your identity online, and to own your voice. To give the wrong people power over you in any regard, or facet, would be a mistake.\n\n"

    "content": "I’m sitting here a little more tired than I’d like to be, but that’s the life of working a manual labor day job, and code-jacking at night (what the hell is code-jacking). Today I want to sort of look back over the past year, and reflect on what it’s been like to mostly abandon Windows (with a slight hiccup of returning for a week).\n\nA lot of people panicked earlier in the year when Microsoft unveiled its AI powered “recall” feature, that screenshots virtually every single thing you do, and then stores it for uh … recalling later. The scary part is, or was, that you definitely should not trust a mega corporation with that kind of info. Even if they tell you not to worry.\n\nAnd many rightfully made the plunge into Linux, and stayed there.\n\nThat’s not why I abandoned Windows, though. I actually left Windows earlier than that, a couple months before the Recall announcement, when I decided that using a laptop for all the resource intensive things I do, … might not be a great idea sometimes.\n\nBuilding a massive song in FL Studio with many, many layers can really lag out a system that isn’t up to spec.\n\nSee, I have another PC (that’s quite dusty now) that I bought in 2018, that was entirely crowdfunded, so that I could do things I need to do in order to make money (at least at the time), and it was great. It helped me out a lot and I eventually dug myself out of a hole. The thing is … Microsoft is dropping support for Windows 10, next year. And it pissed me off, especially, because the processor in that PC is one generation behind what Windows 11 supports. And, because of that, I would have been stuck on Windows 10, without any security updates, or substantial system updates, forever.\n\nI ultimately decided that this was enough of an insult to literally abandon Windows altogether, and forever (seemingly).\n\nYou know, and then they announced Recall, like 2 months later. Two months after I bought a massively powerful Linux PC from System 76.\n\nAnd for months I used it under their flagship operating system, Pop!_OS. I got familiar with VS Code for web development. I moved all of my creative work to Linux, and I even got most of my games that I regularly play working, just fine.\n\nBut, like it does with me sometimes, I got this itch. I wanted to play some Call of Duty, and I definitely don’t feel like running a console, when I have a PC with 64 gigs of ram, something like 15 cores, and 8 gigs of videoram. Doesn’t make any sense.\n\nSo, I made a split decision, and installed Windows 11. And it was fine … for like a week.\n\nBut I noticed, even with all that power, Windows was … somehow laggy, and glitchy. Almost like my PC wasn’t designed for it (or maybe I forgot to download System76 drivers).\n\nEither way, I said, “You know what, this isn’t worth ONE game.” And I then installed one of my favorite Linux distributions, Debian.\n\nWe’re almost caught up to where I am now.\n\nFor about two more weeks, I used Debian, and then I noticed some … weird things, such as games blowing my fans up and my PC sounding like it was taking off into space.\n\nIt was then I realized, I need to update my firmware, and have system drivers from System 76.\n\nWhich, unfortunately, has almost virtually no existing documentation for Debian.\n\nEnter: Now.\n\nI’m back on Pop!_OS.\n\nWhat a journey.\n\n\n\nThe reason I originally didn’t immediately go back to Pop!_OS, was because I’m … kind of unsure of how I’ll react to my Gnome desktop being replaced by whatever it is they give me with COSMIC. But, fear of change aside, this OS is actually, or has actually, really grown on me.\n\nAnd it’s probably as close to Arch as I’ll ever get (that’s ragebait, Pop!_OS is nothing like Arch).\n\nBut, having spent most of the year in Linux, I think I can firmly call this OS my home. It feels natural. I enjoy opening the terminal. I like writing everything in code, even if I don’t have to.\n\nI am become system developer.\n\nWhatever they’re constantly saying on /r/linuxsucks is at least, partially untrue (and also, I can’t tell if these people are serious, or shitposting constantly). It’s not as complicated as they make it seem, but it is definitely more challenging than choosing a Mastodon instance.\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to be a developer to use Linux, but it helps!\n\nYou can literally just, make a Debian bootable, or a Mint bootable, and then replace Windows, and continue using your PC like nothing happened. You don’t even have to interact with the terminal. You can just use the graphical package manager that’s standard on, well, at least three Linux distributions I’ve tried (but where’s the fun in that?)\n\nYou can install Pop!_OS, and then Steam, and then continue your game in Dwarf Fortress just by switching on a little toggle in Steam user options that enables Proton support across every game you own.\n\nIt’s really that simple.\n\nJust don’t expect to play anything with kernel-level anti-cheat.\n\nWhich is probably actually a good thing. Why do game developers think they’re allowed to touch the kernel? Who the hell do you think you are? That dude from Scary Movie 2?\n\n\n\nSuffice to say, I think Linux is where I’ll stay. As Windows becomes more and more bloated, and far, far away from the nostalgia of its greatness in 1995, Linux easily takes its place.\n\nNow, watch this wholesome Debian presentation I found on Youtube.\n\n\n"

That was in my twenties, mostly, and also in the space of time that I was unemployed and suffering disability-levels of anxiety. But then something changed, and I became a machine.\n\nMost days I come home from work, now, and I immediately load up VS Code and start typing. But before that it was music, and before that it was writing, and my Second Life store, or analyzing social media trying to figure out how to expand my audience. Why? Why do I now suddenly spend maybe five hours a week gaming, and the rest of my time just making things? I mean, I know why.\n\nIt’s partially my need, and want, to do something special, to do something people remember, or celebrate. But it’s also my need for self fulfillment. I used to go to work, come home, and just do whatever, and be content with that, and always that. But I’m not content in that anymore.\n\nI went to tech school in the middle of high school to learn to code. I wanted to be a full time web developer. I wanted to be sitting at a computer, analyzing networks, building more efficient web apps, and just … basking in the code. And that was stolen from me. I don’t know if I stole it from myself, or if society pushed me into a place where I subconsciously deemed my lifelong dream career as secondary to what I needed to do in the here and now.\n\nExcept, we’re at the now, and even through accomplishment, and self improvement, there’s still just more struggle.\n\nIt hardly even bothers me anymore that I might just be single the rest of my life. It bothers me more that I’ve been doing all of these things, and building websites, especially, since 19-frikken-99, and I’m … opening boxes for a retailer? I’m wearing a vest and driving into a big box store, and I’m clocking eight hours, and just going home, and thinking … is this the rest of my life?\n\nI think the switch came on when I realized that it wasn’t.\n\nAnd now I’m terrified of stagnation.\n\nThat’s the post. I don’t really know how to remedy this, short of continuing to submit my resume to places hoping something sticks.\n"

    "content": "The idea of a “social media starter pack” is nothing new. In the 90s we had webrings with select websites we wanted to connect with, and share with others. In blogging we have “blogrolls,” and on social media we’ve had “follow fridays” for … forever. And, in regards to the fediverse, numerous people have put together lists of users they think others should follow. So, by all means, Bluesky’s version of this is really nothing new, except in that they call follow lists “starter packs.” In that spirit, I’ve made my own, for the fediverse.\n\nYou can check out my starter pack, and follow via the little follow button I’ve positioned next to each user’s name (yes, I’ve included myself). And this is by no means an exhaustive and complete list! Currently, I’ve slapped this together in about thirty minutes, after having come home from work, napped, and ate a pizza. The list contains those I enjoy seeing on my timeline, and I fully intend to keep adding to it!\n\nRecently, I wrote about how I felt Bluesky was growing on me a little. Mostly in that, I don’t feel like you need to fully avoid it, and it does have its worth. In comparison to the fediverse though, I think I do still mostly prefer my instance, that I run myself, that I moderate myself, on an open protocol that is entirely run by regular normal people (save from the companies connecting or planning to connect to ActivityPub). And I do still have concerns about Bluesky, like how it recently received funding from a crypto company, and it could totally be bought by a billionaire with no morals at any second.\n\nIt’s for those reasons, I’d like to continue building on the fediverse, and this will eventually also include “building” in regards to my scripting and app development. I don’t want to just have scripts referencing Reddit forever. I’ve mostly used Reddit as a testing ground for ideas.\n\nBut, anyway, I hope my starter pack helps you find new people to follow (even though it’s a bit tiny at the moment)!\n"

Obviously, there are reasons to be on Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and for some, it’s a race to the finish line, as to which one “wins” the main-character-social-media-site award.\n\nBut I don’t believe either of the three options will ever be the “main-line, main-character” choice. I think people will continue from this point forward, having specific things they want to accomplish and do online, and the place they go will depend on those very things.\n\nObviously, if you join Threads, you’re probably a fan of Instagram, and you’re looking to connect with, maybe, your audience, or something. And then there’s the ex-Twitter users spilling over, because, it is for sure something like Twitter.\n\nThen you have Bluesky, the site that’s billing itself to be a Twitter replacement, gaining users rapidly, and there are definitely reasons you shouldn’t build a site in order to be the next Twitter. But, there are caveats of Bluesky, in that, you can post your balls and ass, and you won’t get censored. And lots, and lots of people love to do that, on Bluesky, specifically.\n\nAnd then there’s the community building, the list-making, and the large portion of LGBTQ+ users flocking to the site.\n\nIt could contend to be a place that doesn’t suck.\n\nAnd then you have Mastodon, basically, where everyone else goes. Linux enjoyers, and developers alike, especially. And one of the only social media places on the internet that isn’t run by either a billionaire, or backed by some kind of venture capital.\n\nBut what does it mean to use the other two?\n\nObviously, Zuck is a billionaire, a billionaire who definitely has bad ideas, and bad opinions. On the flipside, like mentioned in one of my recent articles, Bluesky is backed by Bitcoin Capital, run by people who know Steven Bannon intimately. So, are you really ultimately in for anything different than what you were exposed to on Twitter?\n\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\nI do think, though, that it’s becoming kind of muddy to say, “You shouldn’t use this, you should use that instead” because, as I’ve just mentioned, both Threads and Bluesky have issues with influence from … the darker side of politics, and the world.\n\nNotice how I don’t mention Mastodon, or ActivityPub in that, because AP is exactly what you make it. But, if I’ve learned anything, very many people want to sign up on something and then forget about it, forever. Which is not something you do on Mastodon. On Mastodon, you have to be an active participant, almost at all times in order for it to become something that you enjoy. And, let’s face it, if you look at regular, normal users on Threads (for example), there are droves, and droves of people wholly uninterested in social participation, and more interested in a viral post that’ll make them an imaginary millionaire.\n\nAt this point, I don’t think it matters too much what you use between the three, and fighting about it is a worthless endeavor. Bluesky and Threads are both connected to ActivityPub in different ways, anyway. So … you could say that Mastodon has already won this metaphorical social media war.\n\nBut, again, I don’t think these things matter.\n\nI do think you should consider your environment, and what the people who facilitate it believe, and say, on a regular basis. You should think critically about your participation online, be it via Threads, Bluesky, or even Mastodon.\n\nAnd you most definitely shouldn’t be on Twitter.\n"

No CORS headers or proxy servers required (this is a frequent problem with things I do here)!\n\nBasically, what both scripts do, is simply read the meta tags from your profile, on Mastodon. All you have to do is make sure that you run these scripts in the head of your HTML, input your user profile into the top of the scripts, and then include each script’s class in an < img > tag and an < a > tag.\n\nAnd that’s it!\n\nNow you can screw around and change your avatar and username on Mastodon, and any time you do that, it’ll be updated on your website.\n\nIf giving the illusion that your website is federated with ActivityPub is something you enjoy doing, this is just one more way to do that.\n"

If you’re reading this on mobile, the toggle will be at the top of the main page (outside of posts, and pages you’ve navigated to). Now, if you feel like you don’t want to be saturated in darkness, you can switch on bone-meal mode. Which, despite disliking most light mode settings on websites, is actually pretty easy on the eyes, due to it not being full-blown, eye-bleaching white.\n\nThis is more reminiscent of a forum I used to visit as a 15 year old in high school, by the name of animeboards.com. A website that I have fond and also bad memories of (my first interaction with online trolls happened here). This also reminds me that I’d love to setup an old school style PHPBB forum … but I don’t know how I would get people to join, of if they’d even want to.\n\nAnyway, you can grab the associated scripts to make this work for yourself, on your own website, here, on my Github.\n"

You should note that this is specifically for Jekyll, and you will need a VPS of some kind to host poast.py. Unless you’re magic, and you can run Python on a static site.\n\nIf you don’t know where to start with all that, I suggest taking a look at Digital Ocean, where you can rent a bare bones VPS for the lowest spec at like 6 dollars a month. And that’s really all you need for poast.py to run (you don’t even need its lowest spec, you could probably execute this script on a 486).\n\nNow, one of the things I mention in the readme on Github, is that I’m using the root user to make this happen. I want to reiterate here, you probably shouldn’t do this, and would be better off making a new user in order to put all of this together. But, I like to live dangerously, and also I don’t feel like reconfiguring everything and moving stuff around.\n\nSo it’s whatever.\n\nI consider this project one of my bigger achievements, because it took me a long time to get to this point.

We talked about the ways in which artists, writers, or creators in-general are taken from, at all angles, with the promise of a boost, or fame, or an income. And I’m still thinking about it.\n\nIt really feels like the AI that scrapes the web for everything ever made by a human being, in order to create amalgamations that look like nightmarish gloss-puke is the endgame to all of this. But I’ve jumped into the epilogue before we explore the content of the text.\n\nFor decades, creative work has always been demanded by those who don’t create, to be free. It got to the point that these things were so devalued by the general public, that it spawned music streaming services that pay fractions on the fraction of another fraction of a penny. It spawned entitled attitudes that get slung at artists doing commissions, that they should not dare charge a fair hourly rate for their work, that they should be grateful for exposure. It spawned endless compendiums of amateur, indie-fiction, because getting into a publishing house is more like a whole scam nowadays.\n\nAnd, eventually, it spawned the full and total pillaging of all of this work, funneled straight to those who believe an idea is worth more than work.\n\nBut I wanted to talk more about another side to all of this.\n\nAs a person who creates, how do you get the word out to people? Do you post on social media and pray that people don’t demonize you for “advertising?” Do you pay for a blue checkmark on Threads in the hopes that it translates into the work that you do actually being seen and appreciated by people?\n\nHave you seen the playlisters in online music scenes who charge artists money to have their music placed on thousand-listener lists? Have you been a store creator in Second Life whose only avenue to advertising their work, is by paying hundreds of dollars to land owners who host store events (this example is a little niche, but directly related to things I personally do)? Have you paid social media coaches to tell you how to post online to draw in the most engagement possible? Queue the random trash-question-posting and rage-bait.\n\nOr, maybe, as an author, or indie author, you’ve spent years querying, only to have your work potentially stolen by a narcissistic agent who posts on Twitter about how she thinks someone else should have your idea, and do it better.\n\n\n\nIn our society, it really seems like the artist, the writer, the maker, the doer, is constantly in a web of traps, laid out by the grifters. Everyone wants to make money off of you, off of your ideas, off of your work, while you squabble in debt, and minimum wage. And the most infuriating part is, they do.\n\n“Pay me, and I’ll make sure you see that success you’ve been grasping for.”\n\nPay, pay, pay!\n\nOne of the reasons my next novel has been basically frozen in time, is because sometimes I really feel like it’s pointless to put something out there. Especially now, that … as soon as you do, it’ll be gobbled up by the plagiarism machines.\n\nI’ve seen so much of this in all that I do, because I’ve been doing these things my whole life. And the scammers, the grifters … they all have the louder voice, the largest influence, and it makes no sense to me.\n\nIt makes no sense that these types of people and this type of behavior really receives no pushback, whatsoever.\n\nBut then I remember the decades past, the squawking about how all of the things you spend hours, days, weeks, months on, should be free, and if you have to sell it, it should be dirt cheap.\n\nIt creates the condition where you start to feel as though you have no choice but to cough up cash to those who believe any money made from the things that you do, belongs to them.\n\nAnd then the cycle repeats, ad infinitum.\n\nDo you wanna know how much I make from streaming without any advertising on the part of paid services, monthly?\n\n\n\nBut we don’t currently live in a society that enables any kind of environment where this can be fixed. We live in the society that will make this worse. And you’re only option in the creation of dreams, art, prose, and more, is to do it for the love of it, and nothing else. Because if you don’t have even that, then what’s the point of anything?\n"

    "content": "Today, while I was working away, (not on the code I shared in my other post, but at work), I suddenly fell into this kind of melancholy. I’ve dated a lot of people. Thirty-some-odd people. But I also, kind of, in my brain sauce, circle back to the one woman with whom I thought would last. None of them last. But her and I were different. We were different, and then we were over.\n\nInevitably, she broke up with me for some dude at Starbucks, and I was angry, and then I was sad, and then I forgot about her for a while when I initially started my transition. Sometimes I wonder if that breakup is what triggered it. I’m not transitioning now, and I don’t know if I’ll ever return to it, but that’s a whole story. I enjoy navigating my life being confused about gender, and just being forward-facing however I feel like being. But I heard from her once or twice over the years. Over the course of the last fourteen years. And I don’t know why I still think about her.\n\nThere are so many other ex girlfriends I could think about. I could think about the one I was with long-distance for a year, who disappeared overnight while I was sleeping, only to come back in Discord messages three years later to apologize.\n\nI could think about the one whose rent I paid and drove to New York, who inevitably broke it off with me to get back with her estranged husband.\n\nI could think about the two women I dated in separate states, who used me for their own gain in different ways, and then tossed me aside like a broken toy.\n\nHell, I could even think about my highschool girlfriend, who somehow remains a part of my life, in some tiny, almost insignificant way.\n\nBut no.\n\nMy head always circles back to the one.\n\nAnd I don’t even know what it is about her anymore. I don’t think it’s important. I don’t think I even exist to her in 2024, and rightfully so. Why would I?\n\nBut it makes me feel like, or wonder, if one of the reasons I have such a hard time, in my near forties, getting close to anyone, is because I refuse to let go of the past. Most of the time all of my thoughts are living in the nineties, or the early 2000s, and I think of myself as I was then, rather than how I am and who I am, now. Everything is me trying to escape what I currently am, and it’s a wonder that even with more matches than I can shake a stick at on dating apps, I talk to no one.\n\nThe present is crumbling all around us, and simultaneously, I’ve never been in a better position in my entire life.\n\nAnd I’m still working on myself, on all of these things, and I’m getting better and better by the day, at everything.\n\nSo then why can’t I let go of the past? Why can’t I ever shake this person, the starbucks-betrayer, out of my head, once and for all.\n\nI don’t know. Maybe this public journal post will derive some kind of enlightenment … ten years into the future when I’m hopefully married and not sitting alone in front of a computer like I always am.\n"

    "content": "So, yesterday, I got home from work late, and wanted to do something more with my website. I wasn’t happy with cbox as a “guestbook” of sorts. It was intrusive, and it was nothing more than an injection of code from some other source, controlled by some other person. That’s no good. I want to be in control of everything having to do with, and running on my website. Therefore, I made GuestPoast.\n\nGuestPoast, available to check out over on Github, is a relatively simple guestbook system that you can setup and use on a static website. In this case, we’re using Jekyll, because that’s what I know best at this point. But! Because we’re using Python, I’m running those scripts on a VPS with a reverse proxy, and runners that keep the guestbook comments live, at all times. There is a way to use Github to run Python, among other things, but I’m a little turned off by the limitation of working seconds (I honestly don’t know how much I’d use if I used Github as a personal VPS. I have a lot of things running over at Digital Ocean).\n\nBut, once you’ve got it all setup, you can then also dive into the JavaScript side of the project, and add naughty words, or slurs, that you don’t want nefarious users to post. Or, you can troll your visitors by not allowing them to say certain things like, “Hello.” Not sure why you’d want to do that, though.\n\nThis is one, in a long line of things I’ve been wanting to do with my website. Ultimately, I’d like my site to be fully integrated with ActivityPub, but whether that’s actually possible or not remains up-in-the-air. And then, of course, we have Bluesky threatening to overtake all social networks. And, I mean, I like Bluesky. But it’s less technical feeling. It’s less mine. My Mastodon instance is my own, the things I do, post, and develop that interact with it are my own. Mastodon, to me, feels like an extension of my Linux operating system. And maybe that’s why the normals don’t like it so much. I don’t know, I’m rambling in my thoughts.\n\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy this new development I’ve put up for free public consumption!\n"

And I thought, “You know, I hate how I have to manually create new pages for every tag I put on a post. What is this? 1927?” So, I set out to fix that problem, and fix that problem I did. But it didn’t come without a small hiccup.\n\nBecause, apparently, Github Pages can only use a certain Jekyll version (which is ridiculous), so, if you were attempting to do this with a custom ruby gem, you wouldn’t be able to run it, unless you stop using the github_pages defined “safe” plugins. Oh no! And switching to full Jekyll, while cool and good, will break GH Pages, and maybe other things! So, instead of building this into the workflow, and having separate this, and separate that, I said, “Hell no, what? We got Python for that.”\n\nAnd Python we did done do.\n\nI’m the kind of person who likes to write. I also like to do all of my writing in VS Code, because it makes me feel cool. And, part of writing, is removing obstacles that make it tedious, and repetitive. Such as copy/pasting links to my new posts, and spreading them across social networks (a problem solved by my server and a ton of scripts), or tagging your posts like you would on Wordpress, and then having to create each tag page manually, so that they can be clicked on.\n\nLike I said on the Github repository for these scripts I’ve created … What am I? A caveman?\n\nIt seems like, the more I do the same things over and over, the more I need automation to take care of the boring stuff I don’t want to do.\n\nYou know.\n\nThose things that AI was supposed to be doing.\n\nI’ve been copying and pasting links to blog posts and sharing them on social media, for decades. Decades. So, when I figured out how to make all of that happen automatically, it was like a dehydrated man in the Sahara Desert discovering a pond. And, after that, it was just more identifying little annoying tasks that take away from doing what I want to do, and then eliminating them. Like the Terminator and a billion Sarah Connors.\n\nBut I still haven’t figured out how I want to automatically fetch post IDs for shared post links on Mastodon, and then copy them into said new posts, so that Mastodon comment sections are generated automatically.\n\nWe’ll get there, though!\n\nUh …\n\nSoon!\n"

With JavaScript and Python, I give you, Pixelfed, and my latest product from Second Life!\n\nTooling around with Pixelfed’s API was a little frustrating, and I still haven’t figured out what I was doing wrong in order to pull statuses directly from the source (with an access code). So, in order to do this, regardless, I decided to utilize my Pixelfed profile atom feed to do exactly what I was trying to accomplish. RSS is the past, and also the future! … apparently.\n\nIf you scroll down and look to the left, you’ll see the five most recent photos from my Pixelfed account, which will update automatically as I add new things to it.\n\nAfter that, I took my simmering migraine headache, and made some scripts to take a look at my Second Life store’s marketplace page. Pointed some python at it and said “Assemble the link, then open the link, then extract the photo and the title.”\n\nDone.\n\nDown on the right of the page, you can see my latest product from my Second Life store, and if you click it, you’ll go right to the page!\n\nAt this point, I have kind of a large amount of content connected to API and my proxy servers, all pulling information from the different platforms I interact with, as I update them. And that’s what automation is all about.\n\nRemoving obstacles to things I want to do, and things I want to show the world.\n\nAnyway, I’m not sure I feel like putting these code snippets and scripts onto Github today.

    "content": "I feel like I’ve explored this topic before, but it keeps coming up on my timeline. Specifically, on the timeline of my Bluesky alt account that I’ve got setup for the off-chance, or the just-in-case situation, where I can no longer exist on my personal Mastodon instance (I love my instance so much, that losing it would be heartbreaking to me, and I don’t know if I would want to move to a new instance after all this time). What keeps coming up on the timeline? People expressing, or better yet, complaining about what they feel is wrong with Mastodon. So, let’s explore a little more.\n\nI will be honest: with Mastodon, what put me off with a lot of UNSAID expectations.\n\nIt felt like you cannot just write something like here:\n\n- What server you’re on matters (each one has own rules)\n\n- Adding filters to posts were (sometimes) important (eg if writing about politics or Twitter)[image or embed]— Gergely Orosz (@gergely.pragmaticengineer.com) November 21, 2024 at 5:18 AM\n\n\nI bring this person’s Bluesky post here, not because they’re some kind of arbiter of Bluesky vs. Mastodon as a topic, but just because this is a sentiment I see a lot.\n\nFor whatever reason, a lot of people just want to input a username, a password, and then sign-in and start posting. At risk of sounding inflammatory, or cynical, people don’t want to think.\n\nBut it seems to go beyond that. Choosing a server, joining a community, expressing your interests, and sharing who you really are, should be something fun, right? But throughout the attached thread, this is apparently seen as as barrier. It’s seen as … gatekeeping?\n\nAnd then the issue with “filters” for posts, or, what they’re called on Mastodon, content warnings. I’ve seen so many people express discontent with having to use them, when to use them, why they’re expected to. A lot of people just want to post, “Here’s my dissertation on the current political climate, and why you should panic,” and expect that no one would be like, “Hey, could you maybe not do this without some kind of warning?” Because, and I have to start again with things that sound like uncharitable takes, they don’t want to consider other people when they say and do things?\n\nThat sure is a sentiment of your average “influencer,” or people who wish they were.\n\nWhat is an influencer? Someone who posts with an inflated sense of self, who assumes that people are fans, followers are their adoring masses, that you should come to them, and accept what they have to say, and what they do, because they’re special, and you are a peasant.\n\nWhat I really think about all of this, is that this is a sickness that was generated by Twitter. It was curated, crafted, and instilled into the masses over years, and years of use of the platform. The algorithm was made to incentivize selfishness, and venom, and so, therefore, that’s how people began to act, that’s how they started to use social media.\n\nTwitter was bad well before it was ever bought out by a megalomaniac.\n\nAnd now we have … a clone of it?\n\nOkay, so Bluesky is good. There are a lot of cool features, and hey! You can sorta, by proxy, connect it to Mastodon!\n\nBut because it’s billed as like this … exact Twitter clone, that’s how people are treating it. They’re bringing that behavior, they’re bringing that inflated ego syndrome, they’re bringing the venom, and they’re continuing it.\n\nAnd when they’re faced with the idea of joining communities, and being social, and being thoughtful of others, it’s … it’s seen as a bad thing.\n\nIn the beginning, in parenthesis, I mentioned how I wouldn’t want to lose my instance, and if I did, it would be too heartbreaking for me to move, and find a new place to be on the fediverse. And it’s true. I’ve been on Mastodon since 2017, and I’ve been in many places. My instance is my home, and I think if I lost it, I would probably concede myself to my Bluesky account.\n\nThat’s not to say that you shouldn’t at least give Mastodon a chance. That’s not to say that you shouldn’t look to learn, and find ways to be social online, again. But, for me, the way I exist on the fediverse, is with my own blood, sweat, and tears.\n\nBut I do think decentralized islands are probably the future?\n\nAnd maybe I’m wrong, maybe I would stick around on the fediverse, even if I lost mkultra.monster. Who knows, I don’t know. The future is a variable I don’t know.\n\nWhat I do know is …\n\nI’m not sure Bluesky will make it. I’m not sure Bluesky will make it, because they’re backed by big money, by people you absolutely should not trust, who will eventually need to raise their own money, and that’s exactly how Twitter became an X. Take my words with a grain of salt. But there’s a reason that the newest generation of teenagers becoming adults are bad at making social connections. That, all people, are connecting less. And it’s not just because society has become more frantic, more driven by greed.\n\nThere are billions of people online, and hundreds of millions of people across Threads, X, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and there are many more social media apps that I haven’t even mentioned here. But the one constant that I’ve noticed on most of them, is that genuine connection is hard to come by. Even on Mastodon, for as socially connected and more thoughtful that it is. I, myself, struggle to connect with people. I don’t know what to say, I don’t know what to do.\n\nSometimes I hit people with a “like” and then I keep on posting. But sometimes I reach out, and I try to be conscious of what I say, and what I do, and that’s largely because of the time I’ve spent on the fediverse.\n\nIs that really a bad thing? Is that gatekeeping? Is that … user-hostile?\n\n"

The world may never know.\n\nBut, I worry about the future a lot, and I like to preserve the things I do so that, no matter what happens, there’s always a contingency. So, now my social media Python stuff also has a contingency.

But! I was … able to dig up the CSS font styling? I don’t think I even made that. But the place was hosted on this service called Homestead. I think, at the time, it was some Geocities alternative. And then I found a pictures archive, from the website, and found this:\n\n\n\nOf all of the things the WayBackMachine could’ve dug up … it somehow managed to save the avatar photo I was using on my little website, and on Animeboards.com.\n\nAmazing.\n\nOh, and I was also able to access this:\n\n\n\nWhich must have been what I was using on the site’s sidebar. It’s not really anything all that special, but I can at least be like, “Hey, I wrote the filename of this image and edited it in 2001, and in some miniscule way, that’s like reaching out and glimpsing past-me.”\n\nCould I do anything with this, now? Probably.\n\n\n\nThere we go, that’s marginally better. And I can tell by looking at it that I was using some kind of ancient photo editing software to manipulate it, and color out whatever was around her. I must have spent a while erasing that background. But, now, I can resurrect a piece of that old-internet work that I did, and add it to my modern website.\n\nI may not be able to travel back to 2001 and stop myself from being so cringe at times, or give myself the chance to play The Sims when it was brand new again, or go on AOL Instant Messenger and talk to my two internet girlfriends one more time.\n\nBut, at least I got this?\n\nNo, but it is really a shame that crawlers didn’t do a better job of preserving much less, lesser known sites. So much of my past, that exists that long ago are more like spots of cloudy memory at this point. I remember the house, I remember my computer, I remember the AOL dings. I remember the addiction to the forums, the hiding my screen in software dev class while I played DOOM.\n\nAnyway, thanks for coming along for this kind of disappointing ride back to 2001.\n"

But, that aside, from within my feed, I’m watching and seeing reports of constant troll attacks, some stating, “Yeah, I don’t like it here actually.” So, let’s talk about Mastodon, again, maybe?\n\nOver the past week or so, I’ve seen posts from people talking about, and have experienced personally, Kiwifarms trolls following people in some inane scare tactic. If you don’t know what KF is, it’s an extremely niche stalker website full of pyschopaths whose only hobbies are documenting and stalking people online, with mostly fabricated information.\n\nIt’s been giving people a bit of a sour taste in their mouths in regards to sticking to this, basically, brand new platform.\n\nTo add insult to injury, it seems now, as of today, that trolls are going around sending users extremely graphic and violent images of death.\n\nI want to note, that Mastodon is not perfect by any stretch. But this is where true decentralization comes in, and saves the day.\n\nIf you’re on a community run instance on Mastodon (or other AcitivityPub software), or your own, you don’t have to put up with this kind of behavior. You don’t have to play whack-a-mole with every new account that pops up. You can just … block out the instance that is acting as the source of this behavior.\n\nOf course, Mastodon does have its own issues. There are a lot of basic FOSS guys, and do they love to either give you bad advice, unprompted advice, or scold you for doing things your way.\n\n\n\nI’m showing you this, in order to be fully transparent about what you may encounter on Mastodon, and how we would deal with this. For context, I have Python scripts running on a VPS, and one of them sends random images from top posts across different subreddits, to Mastodon. Some of them are NSFW, some of them aren’t. Either way, I also have it tagging each post with hashtags I wanted to have on it, like #python (because it’s running on python!)\n\nThis isn’t favorable to some. Simply using your mute button isn’t enough. Some people have to tell you that they don’t like that you’re using your software, your instance, and your social media to do whatever you want, your own way.\n\nAnd that’s fine!\n\nWe can send him into the ether, never to be heard from again. Or, we can block the entirety of the instance he’s coming from.\n\nIn this example, I’m not sure what kind of behavior usually comes out of chaos.social, but we can check it to see if this is the attitude of more of its users, or if this guy is an outlier.\n\n\n\nSo, chaos.social looks pretty run-of-the-mill and likely not a massive source of basic FOSS guys trying to dictate to random people on the fediverse how they should post. We won’t have to block the whole entire instance. But! Since blocking single users is probably something everyone’s already familiar with, and doesn’t take a lot to figure out how to do, let me just show you how one would block the whole instance, if in fact it was a bed of trolls and hats of the arse.\n\n\n\nIf you click that little pea-pod under a user’s post, and look down, you can see the option to, as a singular user, block the entire domain.\n\nWhat this will do, is evaporate all posts coming from that server, entirely. You will never see them again, unless you unblock them.\n\nIn the instance that a server happens to be a bed of trolls, maybe trolls who are sending people threats, being assholes, or generally gross, this is an awesome feature.\n\nNow, I get it. The perfect social media experience would be never having to interact with, or deal with trolls, or people with a superiority complex. Unfortunately, that’s not the world we currently live in. When choosing a Mastodon server, or a server of any kind that’s connected to ActivityPub, it is very important to make sure that server has rules, and guidelines for behavior.\n\nI understand that this is, for some, an incredible extra step to just signing up, and posting. But it’s essential. It … will really help avoid situations down the line where you’re suddenly asking the entire fediverse, “Hey, why are there so many trolls???” and then everyone’s pointing to your instance, that has no rules.\n\nIf you decide Bluesky isn’t the right place for you, don’t go back to Twitter. Give the “Linux of social media” a chance, and maybe you won’t be disappointed. Mileage may vary, but there really is something to using software that is highly customizable, near completely user owned, and run.\n"

It may ask you to input a username and a password, which you can also input in the provided fields (I had to do this).\n\nI don’t condone using this to be malicious in any way, shape, or form.

Sharkey has a lot more customization options, a lot more everything.

The sharkey instance is also cheaper, and I need to save my money.\n\nI’ve also got just about every single script I’ve made, hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS, working correctly and posting to the new instance, including the auto-posting this blog does once I hit commit!\n\nThe only downside, is posts aren’t going to have comments until I figure out a different way to do them, and some of the elements on my sidebars here are commented out until I design a different way to display my presence on the fediverse.\n\nAll-in-all, this is really cool, and I’m sure I’ll spend countless hours redoing scripts to interface with Sharkey (lol oh god).\n"

This is true for a lot of things I do, except for these scripts I’ve been making lately. So, let’s fix that.\n\nI already have an automated account on my Mastodon instance that I use for sharing random things cycled via Python scripts on my VPS, but what if we used it to share random songs from all of my releases?\n\nAnd that, we have done.\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t use Bandcamp. Because Bandcamp won’t let you scrape artist pages with a script, and if you’re going to use a browser in headless mode to achieve the same thing (and make it work), you need the server where you’re running that script to actually allow you to do that.\n\n… which I cannot do at Digital Ocean (the chromium driver needed to do this is either inaccessible, or non-existent).\n\nSo!\n\nEven though I absolutely do not use Spotify, due to their negligence of artists, and paying them, it is at least a public app that can be accessed and even listened to by pretty much anyone.

Little to no issues, elastic search built-in, on-time updates, and even when I was having some financial issues, they worked with me in order to keep my instance from making me go broke in the short term.\n\nI’m now currently running my own copy of Sharkey over at Elest.io, and they’ve been alright so far, but the experience is mostly in my own hands, since I now maintain the instance, plus the structure behind it.\n\nBut! If you’re interested in hosting a very simple Mastodon instance, and want little to fuss with, or even setup, I highly recommend Toot.io hosting. I even felt kind of bad turning off my Mastodon instance, just because they’ve been so good this whole time. But I yearned for more, and Sharkey has the more I’m looking for.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you should launch your own instance of alternative ActivityPub software, though! If you’re new to this, and maybe don’t know how to use a command line, or a terminal, absolutely get yourself some managed hosting.\n\nThat’s it, that’s the post.\n"

Or, in this specific day and age, Diablo 4, so that you can prove you’re better than Elon Musk.\n\n\n\nNo, I won’t elaborate on that.\n\nBut I’ve been playing a lot of Diablo 4. I’m beyond level 50 now! Which is more than I can say for myself when the game actually released.\n\nPlaying this game, though, kind of makes Diablo 3 look like something I’m unsure how I ever enjoyed. I did, of course, but 4 is so much prettier, and darker, and also I’m a Necromancer and everything I touch dies in milliseconds.\n\nYes, bosses, too.\n\nDiablo is something that goes back. Way back. It was one of the games I started playing after Doom and Quake finally started to get kinda old feeling, to me. You know, back in like 1997. You see, my uncle and cousin used to play Diablo 1, and eventually, Diablo 2 together all the time. And I wanted to join them.\n\nI just wasn’t all that good at it, and I didn’t have any money to buy these games.\n\nI did, however, get hold of Diablo 1. And I think back to one of my first, and last experiences with the game. A player, lending me his sword. It was powerful. I had nothing. I was just … a noob. I don’t even think I was halfway to whatever max level was back then.\n\nI certainly wasn’t anywhere near hell.\n\nBut I needed a weapon. One that was good. And this guy was willing to lend me his sword until I found something better.\n\n“Here, you can use my sword for a while.” I paraphrased. “I’ll be on tomorrow!”\n\nAnd then I logged off.\n\nAnd then I never logged on again, ever (if you’re out there, I’ll give you a new sword in Diablo 4).\n\nI got more serious when it came to Diablo 2, but I was still largely, no good, and also crap.\n\nAnd then flash forward to Diablo 4, I’m alright, I guess.\n\n\n\nThrough D3 and D4, though, I do find it continually strange, as my Necromancer draws no fear from other people, and in Diablo 4, my Necro speaks about the “light,” and heaven.\n\nMeanwhile I’m here like, … wouldn’t the Necromancer be on Lillith’s side?\n\nThen again, I haven’t even finished act 1 (I spend a lot of time wandering and doing mostly nothing but side quests and killing bosses).\n\nI think if Blizzard ever made a new MMO, they should just do it with this. I mean, that’s basically what it is at this point.\n\nAnyway, that’s the post. I just wanted to say, “Hey, Diablo 4 is pretty cool.”\n"

Three years. I’m not trying to lend any weight to Metallica of the early 00s who rallied against Napster due to them believing that a downloaded album is a loss of payment, because it’s not (if someone can’t or doesn’t plan to buy your music, and pirates it instead, it’s obviously not a lost sale). But, when you can, and if you can, you should buy the music that you enjoy.\n\nOn top of that, Spotify and Joe Rogan have an exclusive streaming deal that goes on through 2025, and if you’ve been alive and awake for the past seven or eight years, you already know why Joe Rogan is a guy who sucks and is a pile of garbage.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, in this new era, we can convince ourselves that just because something is easy, or just because it’s something billions of people do, doesn’t mean it’s something we have to do.\n\nIf you’re an Apple fan, Apple Music pays all artists, regardless of amount of streams, and I believe Tidal and even Youtube Music does, as well!\n\nI’m personally a fan of Apple Music, but mainly because all of my devices are from Apple, except for my Linux PC, and Dell laptop that I’ve got Debian 12 running on. And Apple also does another thing that makes total sense, and separates Podcasts in a different app, so that you aren’t shuffling around music and podcasts at the same time (yes, I’ve used Spotify and felt really cumbersome tapping around both types of media). But, you don’t have to use Apple stuff, you can just use one of the other ones I mentioned, … even though Google isn’t exactly a great company anymore, either.\n\nRegardless, buy the music you like, stop using farking Spotify, for the love of garsh, and support artists in your day-to-day life.

    "content": "Back in the day, we’ll say 2017? I think, or I’m pretty sure that’s when I first joined Mastodon. It was back on my mastodon.social days, because, well, I’m not sure there were as many privately run instances, and this was before I launched a GNU Social instance (wish I would’ve found a way to keep it, would be awesome to still have it). But one of the first things that caught my attention wasn’t really the UI, or the diversity of people and ideas on my timeline as I gradually followed those I was interested in seeing. It was, in fact, the federated timeline that kept me captivated.\n\nYou can see this, now, on pretty much all ActivityPub software (aside from like Pixelfed, I think?), but to me, when I first saw it, it was like the first time I played an MMO. It was mesmerizing. I came from Twitter where what I saw were random people that an algorithm decided to feed to me. Usually, it was always some junk meant to make you mad, to get you angry, so that you’d engage, and keep you on their site longer, and longer (and it worked, for a long time). But, seeing all of the people an instance was connected to, across probably all of the instances that existed at the time, was freakin’ wild.\n\nThis was back when I was still out-of-work and suffering from some major anxiety and agoraphobia issues, so I had some time on my hands.\n\nI think, the very first time, I spent an entire night watching people zoom by with whatever thoughts they were shooting out into the void.\n\nLike logging onto my Night Elf for the first time in 2004 World of Warcraft, it was something I had never seen before. People, unfiltered, non-algorithmic, just living in the social media moment.\n\nThis isn’t something you can get on Bluesky, as much as the devs tout what their idea of “decentralization” is. Bluesky is very much just Twitter, but with a PDS that lets you store media and a handle.\n\nBut, on my own instance now (again, and self-hosted), the timeline isn’t as fast as it was when I was on .social in 2017, and this is largely due-in-part to the fact that I block many instances with negative, bad, or sometimes illegal content. The last time I saw the .social timeline, they were … let’s say, a lot more lax about what they allowed through the pipeline.\n\nI’m not.\n\nI pay for this server, and so I keep the fungal mass out.\n\nIf you haven’t really experienced this, I highly recommend you turn on the advanced web interface for Mastodon, and then watch as the thoughts stream by. Maybe you’re on a big instance and it’ll be like a waterfall, or you’re like me on a smaller instance, and it’s more like a dripfeed.\n\nWhichever.\n\nThe thing though, most of the mobile apps have this too … except for the official Mastodon app. For real. One of the most unique things about ActivityPub, and it’s not included in the official app? To me, that’s kind of a fumble.\n\nWhy isn’t it there? Too much a chance people might see things that are bad for Apple policy? Things that could be rectified by … correctly moderating who you’re federating with?\n\nEither way, that’s my piece of it. I enjoy seeing people’s thoughts stream by, even if I don’t interact with most of them, and now I have an idea for a potential different feature on this website (haha).\n\nGood night, I’m going to turn on some ambient and zone out.\n"

In my personal life, I’m moving positions at work, so there’s a stressor, but not too stressy, because it’s a position I’m familiar with. And then in the real world, BAM. A health insurance CEO gets murked, and then there’s a multi-day manhunt, and it ends … with bro eating a burger at McDonalds?\n\nI’m sure by now the whole entire internet has heard about the UHC assassination, and I’m also sure almost the entire internet didn’t give a flying fart that some billionaire who has caused the deaths of thousands (maybe even millions??) was killed. A life for many lives, seems fair? But then the shooter, whoms’t we’ll just call Luigi, since he’s been picked up by the cops … jumps on a bike, dumps a backpack, and then 3 days later emerges in Pennsylvania for a burger. At which point an elderly employee snitches on him.\n\nThen the whirlwind comes out, and his Twitter is unearthed, and his political leanings are as confusing as wrapping your head around how someone who was so careful from the start, ended up at McDonalds with all of the evidence the cops would need to arrest him. (/me breathes out) But, maybe he planned it that way? You know? Your face is on security cameras flirting with someone at a hostel (they have hostels in New York? They don’t just call them shared motels? The heck?), and maybe you figure, “Damn, uh, I am probably going to get caught, huh.”\n\nAnd then he flips a switch and his Youtube starts uploading videos. The first one comes and it says something about how everything’s planned, and more is coming … “soon.” And then there’s a quick flash of the date, “December 11th.”\n\n\n\nA couple of hours later, another video premiere begins on a 45 minute timer, and this is all you see …\n\n\n\nFor those who don’t know, or don’t want to decipher it, this is binary code that reads, “The Truth will set me free.”\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the timer, Google / Youtube stepped in and deleted the entire channel. Although, I seriously doubt the content he had scheduled was deleted. I’m sure that’s on a Google server waiting to be sent to the police in Altoona or New York (whichever). But … that’ll be interesting to see, if ever.\n\nNow, there are other things, like his praise of the Unabomber on Goodreads where he also quotes a Reddit user in his thoughts on the book, and the world, in-general. And an apparent Instagram account, which … I won’t even try to find, as people flock to the site making new accounts under the man’s name in a vapid, shallow attempt at getting a ton of followers really quick before the story dies down (frikken opportunists).\n\nI think it all brings together a rightful distaste for corporate America, and how our society is run. In that, it sucks a whole lot of ass, and it ain’t getting any better. But, if you were hoping his politics would be pure, so that it would be easier for you to excuse him: Good luck. In one moment he’s an anti-capitalist, and in the next he’s a traditionalist talking about birth rates in Japan.\n\nIf you were expecting someone who would 3D-print half of a Glock (a ghost gun), and then shoot someone in broad daylight to make total sense, think again.\n\n     View on Threads\n\n\nBut, despite all of this, there is something else to takeaway from it. The reaction, the millions of people all over the country, cheering him on. Cheering on the assassination, with rage, and sighs of relief, that finally, one of these bastards experienced a consequence for all of the evil they manifest in their day-to-day lives.\n\nAnd I don’t blame them.\n"

    "content": "Over the past decade, there’s been a growing epidemic of excess. Influencers on social media flaunting expensive cars, designer clothing, big houses (so you wanna be a rock superstar), and then, of course, the extremely lucky Youtubers, TikTokers, and so on and so forth, who make it big because they hit the algorithm correctly. But, in all reality, this is a small amount of people who do these things. Becoming rich and famous is not something the average person, or most people, will ever attain. It’s like they say, you have more in common with a homeless person, than a billionaire.\n\nAnd that’s true.\n\nI’ve been “making content,” all sorts of things, for as long as I can remember now. I hit it very minimally “big” in 2022 with some NFT project I was drawing by hand, and then I lost all of it within 6 months. Albeit, it was only 10,000 dollars, and I was able to buy things I didn’t have, that I needed. But, like life does, as soon as good things happen, bad things follow. And all of that money was gone in seconds. And now I’m in debt because of it (car repairs, sick pets, failing hardware).\n\nAbout two years before that, I had a bestselling album in the darksynth sector of Bandcamp. Am I rich? Am I famous?\n\nNo, and no.\n\nShortly after having some big success in music, I was systematically removed from the synth/retro scene by bad actors who, to this day, still look to control this tiny niche of a music scene. However they see fit, to whatever ends they decide. It’s a copy, a carbon copy, of the real, actual music scene. And it blows nuts, and tons of ass.\n\nI’ve been running a Patreon since 2012, and recently shifted over to Ko-fi and Liberapay. I’ve been working on a new album, a book, tons of Python scripts to make my website cooler, and my Mastodon instance more dynamic and interesting. I’ve been writing, forever, doing web design even longer. And I’m just about as broke as I was a decade ago. Just, now I have more bills, and a full time job that hardly pays for it all.\n\nI live paycheck to paycheck, and I’ve been paying on debt for almost three years that never seems to go away. And soon, soon! I’ll have education expenses coming my way, as the buffer period starts to run out, and I start owing on classes for a major I didn’t even finish (computer science, physics, front-end development).\n\nAnd I have an inkling of a suspicion that this is how a lot of people are living. A lot of people in this country owe a billion companies a ton of money, and at the end of the month they’re, like me, probably left with mostly peanuts to push around so that they can do things that bring them some kind of joy.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, you should keep making things. Keep making silly little videos, keep drawing, keep making music, keep writing, keep creating. But don’t do it in the pursuit of extreme amounts of money and fame. The only people in the world who are rich beyond their wildest dreams were either lucky, or perpetuators of mass amounts of exploitation and pain.\n\nSure! Maybe one of the people reading this will get lucky, and you’ll have your wildest dreams come true, but for most of us? The life you’re living now is probably the way it’s going to be for a long time, if not, for the rest of your life. And that’s okay.\n\nIt’s not the luck that’s letting you down, it’s the system.\n\nIf every single person were rich and thriving, nobody would be. Being rich depends on other people being poor. And that’s why everything is so beyond screwed up, in 2024. A system that demands some people suffer, so that others can live in permanent comfort, frickking sucks ass, by design. And it’s not your fault!\n\nSo buy that Mocha Cappuccino, and subscribe to Max and watch Lord of the Dragons or whatever, and write that book, and then post it online so some soulless algorithm can copy and paste it into an uninspired jerkwad’s publishing machine. Wander around in Second Life and pretend you own a home, and then start a band. Play some music, make 40 albums, move to New York, and–\n\nYou know what, just do you.\n"

That the team behind the app sort of leaves it mostly in the hands of the users to construct block and mute lists (which comes with accountability issues all on its own). But, one would only have to take a gander at the current Bluesky search results for Jesse Singal’s account on the app, to see where some of this frustration might be coming from.\n\nSo, in response, I offer the alternative of Mastodon / ActivityPub again! Despite the random negative-posting I’ve seen on Bluesky about Mastodon (people don’t like aspects of the UI and join process), I really think people should check it out. Do some research. Find a community that has rules and guidelines. If you do this, I think you’ll be just fine.\n\nDo you know how much bigotry and toxicity I see on my own instance?\n\nZero.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I ban every single thing that even so much as slightly annoys me (ban, as in suspending from federation, i.e., making them invisible to my entire server).\n\nIf you’d like to give it a try, I have open registration on my instance at mkultra.monster, and while I can’t sustain thousands of people, I can at least take in some. For MKMO, you only need provide a clear reason why you want to join (this is to weed out trolls), and give me some time to approve your account.\n\nOtherwise, there are plenty other instances to look at, too. I suggest giving my page on ActivityPub a look, and then also the Join the Fediverse website.\n\nThat’s all for now! I have to get ready for work soon, but I wanted to put this out there for those who may be interested in a real alternative to corporate-controlled, poorly moderated social media.\n"

And the same is true for the social media app that calls itself “decentralized” while not being decentralized whatsoever.\n\nGiving users keys they can host on a VPS that open up a connection to your server farm is not what decentralization is.\n\nBut anyway …\n\nOver the past week, Bluesky has managed to utterly destroy user trust in a period of time that’s even faster than Mozilla’s destruction of trust. A week ago, people were praising Bluesky as a safe alternative to Twitter that won’t host or embolden neo nazis. Now, bsky has become a haven for Jesse Singal, a dangerous troll who has lawyers.\n\nLawyers who are apparently requesting private information of users from Bluesky, and are being obliged???\n\nThis is what we call a Guinness Book of World Records attempt at enshitification.\n\nI tried to find the official stance on all this, though, but it seems sources directly from Bluesky devs / moderators have either been deleted, or hidden. So, a lot of this probably sounds like hearsay, and the only thing I can really show is this post from hexbear.\n\nBut, if this is true even in the slightest, you should leave Bluesky, immediately.\n\nYou should leave Bluesky, and just … find a decent Mastodon instance. Which isn’t hard. I’ve written so many little guides on how to determine if an instance is good or bad, and I really have to reiterate, that while ActivityPub has its issues, it definitely doesn’t have a problem with moderation (as long as you don’t join a lawless instance, and I have to repeat, do not do that). Largely, because moderation issues are in the hands of the users, entirely.\n\nI own my own server, I host and run it myself, and I completely ban anything I want!\n\nNo waiting for a trust and safety team to tell me all the reasons why they can’t do anything. Just one click of a button, and the shit’s gone, bro.\n\nWe do not currently take action on accounts that share Bluesky screenshots with commentary, unless that commentary violates our Guidelines. We will take action when someone's private information is shared without their consent, but only when it is personally identifiable and verifiable in-app.— Bluesky Safety (@safety.bsky.app) December 13, 2024 at 12:53 PM\n\n\nAnd that’s how all instances technically work!\n\nNow, I know not everyone in the world reads this blog, so these things I keep saying for sure aren’t reaching masses of people. But I post these things so that maybe they’ll be found in the future when people are looking for answers, or alternatives.\n\nAnd I realize that some may return to Twitter, some may jump over to Threads, or return to Threads, and ActivityPub may experience another influx.\n\nBut if you were thinking, “Huh, Bluesky? Must be too good to be true.” Well, it is.\n"

Destroyed, as in, as soon as you launch it, it closes itself. But, there’s a work-around …\n\nThe issue, is that, apparently, in the latest update a few days ago, due to recent changes with regard to Mesa drivers, Firestorm no longer works. There is a fix on the way, but, as we know, these fixes could take … any infinitely guessable amount of time to hit your machine. It could be tomorrow, it could be in 3 weeks, it could be in 3 months. Who knows!

In response to this move, some developers descended upon ActivityPub, and created an alternative, or, a clone of Reddit, that operates on AP, and looks exactly the way it did in 2013. This could be a plus, or a minus, depending on who you are and what you like. Also, for a while now, I’ve been running a script on a VPS that posts random images from select subreddits, to Mastodon. But! Not anymore. Now that script uses Lemmy.\n\nThe great thing about Lemmy’s API, is that it requires absolutely no API keys or credentials. You only need your Mastodon account developer credentials, and you’re pretty much already done. I modified my Reddit script, because I want to begin promoting ActivityPub even more-so, now that the owners behind Bluesky have decided that, in record time, they’d like to enshitify their platform. Which, also spawned a brand new Lemmy instance as some user’s response to that.\n\nYou can grab my script here, and deploy it in about 5 minutes on your own VPS. And I recommend using a VPS, or some kind of environment that can’t easily be accessed by the public, unless you want your Mastodon credentials to be public (this can be altered to use the environment, but I haven’t done that because I’m lazy).\n"

Forums are probably a no, and even NaNoWriMo are now AI shills.\n\nAnd that’s the problem.

    "content": "I didn’t post about this when it happened, because, honestly, I’m unsure how much attention I want to give toxic people, and, after so many years of this being routine from people with Main Character Syndrome (see: narcissism) on social media, it’s tiring. But, Bluesky was an unwelcoming hellscape when it required invite codes to join, and it’s still exactly that, except now it has millions of people on it. Of course, there’s the drama surrounding Jesse Singal’s presence on the network, and some trans woman who made a bot that made a trust and safety team member’s porn likes full-public-facing, but this isn’t really about that. At least not right now.\n\nI’m going to be fully transparent, again, like I always am: I came out as trans in 2012, and I began transition in that same year. Things were rough, because I was at this pivotal position in life where I didn’t know who I wanted to be, and I didn’t know who I was, and I was suffering from anxiety already, before I jumped in. I made mistakes with my family, and things got dark for a while (they aren’t anymore). I lost my job because of harassment I had been enduring, and HR’s inability to take any action whatsoever. It transformed me into someone with crippling anxiety, and that of a person who could not function in public.\n\nMy first interactions with the trans community were on Reddit, where people posted photos of their faces and asked how well they “pass,” and people would routinely tear others down and talk about things that are either very hard to change, or can’t change at all. I had people telling me they liked my face before transition more than in the midst of it, and all of these experiences kind of setup my mindset for the following five years that went by (including the stalker I gained from the aforementioned subreddits).\n\nI didn’t, and never had any community offline. Every trans woman I came into contact with in offline spaces ended up causing me some kind of pain, or heartbreak, for whatever reason. A girl in Philadelphia who used me for a day as a ride around town while she spouted off racist remarks about random people passing us by. A girl in West Virginia who is, coincidentally, also currently posting on Bluesky, who used me to make her ex girlfriend jealous, and then viciously abused me by pretending to attempt to take her own life over the phone, to me. Another who was a locksmith at the time, who I saw on and off for over a year, who ended our time together by telling me that I wasn’t “dating material.” After, again, well over a year.\n\nI met someone I knew from Twitter for coffee, and she proceeded to never speak to me again, afterward, only because, I’m assuming, I didn’t ask to see her again.\n\nAnd then there was the detransed person I knew from my job at the time, who was one of the most horrible people I’ve ever known, and had the displeasure of interacting with.\n\nIt’s safe to say, there’s no such thing as community offline. Or, at least, there never was.\n\nOnline, it wasn’t much better.\n\nI came into contact with Laurelai Bailey, and in my extremely vulnerable state, I was manipulated, and then held emotionally and psychologically hostage for years, and I think this was a major contributor to my inability to ever belong to a community of any sort (Bailey has an extremely long paper-trail of being a social parasite online, among other things. Such as a rapist, and an FBI snitch).\n\nI tried to find community on Tumblr, which didn’t happen, because Tumblr is very bad at actually connecting people together who have the same interests, and there were more bigots on Tumblr, than anything. I tried to find community on Twitter, and found endless toxic popularity contests and mean-girling. I tried to find community on Mastodon, and in my constant turmoil, I was banned, and then banned again (kitty.town), and then banned again (deadinsi.de), and then banned again (cybre.space)–Every single time someone decided to troll me, or attack me for my views, or how I looked, or what-have-you. I do not have good experiences with third-party fedi admins. Which is why I now run my own instance (tech bros who run instances routinely villianize those who are being attacked, rather than villainize the people doing the attacking).\n\nI became part of the Twitter synthwave scene, and found some kind of community, albeit, it wasn’t a trans community. It was mostly men, who, years after, I realize were only tolerating my presence. Suffice to say, despite having a bestselling dark-synth album, I was ejected from that community after exactly one complaint against a transphobic comment, to the response of hundreds of people within Twitter-synthwave dogpiling and harassing me. I was muted and blocked by streaming radio stations, and my label (at the time), seemingly vanished from the internet completely. Then I was, again, on my own.\n\nThis kind of coincides, or leads up to me being banned from hackers.town on Mastodon, but that was more of the same in regards to what I’ve already mentioned: Tech bros and their sycophants, with backwards ideologies in regards to harassers and victims.\n\nAnd you might be asking yourself at this point, “What’s this got to do with Bluesky?”\n\nYou see, I have to give some backstory here (and there is so much more to it than this), because it won’t make sense if I don’t.\n\nI joined Bluesky over a year ago (as of posting this), because I finally got an invite code, and despite putting my transition on pause (which I could probably argue is more to do with severe anxiety and fear than anything else), I still wanted to find community. Which, at this point, I’m almost certain does not exist, anywhere. But, the problem with Bluesky, is that it has attracted all of the people who made Twitter shitty back in 2014: Harassers, narcissists, and self-described “mean girls.”\n\nI recall a block list operator on Bluesky (who eventually got pushed off of the platform) who posted along with someone at the bsky domain “benni.gay” or something? And this Bennie, was, or still is, one of those strange people who not only identify with violent slurs, but regularly post them. We’re talking about “tranny” here. And me, with all of this disgusting backstory of nonstop bullshit, comes into contact with this person, and of course my reaction was, “Hey can you not do that.”\n\nAnd, you know, since, apparently new-gen trans people have decided that slurs aren’t slurs, and I still get much, much younger trans women on Bluesky questioning me like, “What do you mean tranny is a slur?” I can only assume that there is an extreme lack of education in these faux online communities. But!\n\nI questioned this person, and before tossing her a mute, I felt it was courtesy to at least ask or say, “Can we not post these kinds of words without a warning of some sort?”\n\nYou know what happened next. You already know.\n\nDogpiling, harassment, vicious narcissism, and violent denial of lived experience.\n\nNeedless to say, I originally deleted my account because of this, and joined Threads for a while, to begin normal-posting. And then, after a while, I launched my own Mastodon instance, and herein began where we are today, a year later.\n\nBut, you see, Bluesky has been gaining popularity, so … why not try again?\n\nOh, well, okay. So that was a bad idea.\n\n\n\nAnd you can probably already guess, this lead to … harassment! Dogpiling! And eventual block-listing!\n\nMaybe there’s something wrong with me. Maybe I’m too chill, or I give people too much benefit of the doubt. Maybe I’m emotionally non-existent, because of my history, and therefore can’t really see this coming anymore. Or, maybe online communities, especially and specifically those revolving around trans communities, aren’t good and are very bad, actually.\n\nTo be part of one of these communities, you have to subject yourself to bad jokes, labeling yourself with slurs that violent attackers have actually used against you, right before attempting to snatch you out of the driver side seat of your car (this happened, to me), and all-around act like a petulant, vapid psychopath, with no morals, or qualms with anything unless it affects you directly.\n\nWell.\n\nMerry Christmas, mother-freakers.\n\nI stay on Mastodon, despite the numerous failures of admins across different instances, because it’s an online experience that I can completely control, while running my own instance, and own community. And even if nobody ever joins mkultra.monster, at least I can’t be ejected from my own platform for having the audacity to have feelings about things, and morals.\n\nBut I do think, at this point, Bluesky is beyond a failed experiment, because all it does is emulate the worst parts of Twitter, before Twitter became only the worst parts.\n\n"

Because MacOS is also Unix.\n\nIt’s a purely locked down and extremely secure version of Unix, so-much-so that if you try and watch any streaming app on an external monitor through MacOS, the whole screen goes blank.\n\nYeah.\n\nI wanted to write a plea to Apple, because they definitely read my blog (see: sarcasm), because, it’s almost 2025. No average person is pirating anything anymore. I’m pretty sure most gen z and alpha kids/adults have no idea what the phrase “pirating a movie” even means. Nobody is recording shows and movies through a capture device on a secondary monitor. So, can we please, let me watch Apple TV on my second, much larger monitor?

I can see all my texts coming through on my desktop, work on writing my book in the Pages app I’ve been using for over a year, and I can use Affinity!\n\nI dumped Photoshop a long time ago, after they went face-first into AI, and started up with the predatory subscriptions. And Affinity is probably the greatest alternative.\n\nBut there’s no Linux port. And a dev told me directly they have no plans to support Linux.\n\nWhich is a huge bummer. In fact, it’s kind of … dumb. I almost swore off their entire software suite, because you’ve already developed this software for MacOS, which is a variation of UNIX!\n\nRegardless …\n\nIf I somehow blew your mind that MacOS is in fact Unix based, and you don’t believe me, open up Terminal on your Mac. Create a simple bash script. I dunno, something that says “Hello world!” To do this, type “nano hello.sh”, and within that new file, type in “#!/bin/bash”, and then press enter. Now type “echo “Hello world!” Now, press ctrl + O, and then ctrl + X. Lastly, type in chmod +x hello.sh (or whatever you name your bash script). Now! Run it! Type in “./hello.sh”\n\nAnd voila.\n\nAll of the things you just did are exactly how you’d accomplish the same thing in Linux. You probably thought, “Wait, what the heck? Nano is included in MacOS?”\n\nYup.\n\nAnyway, welcome to the world of only Unix based machines.\n"

Either way, corporate social media (Threads) has an algorithm, and that algorithm has decided that on Christmas Eve (Happy holidays!), that I should be shown the scum of the Earth, who believe there are people who shouldn’t be able to afford to live if they’re working one of those jobs (italics, if you’re reading from Mastodon). We’re talking all of the jobs where people were called Essential in 2020 while they worked through what was called a deadly virus. A virus that is, for sure, still out there.\n\nJobs that absolutely should have been compensated with hazard pay.\n\nI’m talking restaurant jobs, service jobs, big box store jobs. Basically, anything that aids in the procurement of food and water for the rest of the population … some of which, who take this for granted, because their world doesn’t expand beyond the tip of their noses.\n\nInstead of amplifying the voices of people who don’t deserve to be able to say things online, I just want to point out that the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage debate has gone on for so long that the actual living wage is more like 30+ dollars an hour in 2024 (going on 2025). Corporations have hiked prices so high, and landlords are abusing the fact that there are zero consequences for their actions, so much, that 15 dollars an hour, now, would be like making 7 dollars an hour in 2015.\n\nIt’s no longer adequate.\n\nThe idea that some people should live in poverty, just because the lucky few had 100,000 dollars to spend on college, or were a trust-fund baby, is horrid, and outdated, and it’s about high-time we tie the living wage to the cost of living, and so-called inflation (see: greedflation).\n\nBut even if every single person on Earth, alive today, went to college, became doctors, engineers, astronauts, and so on and so forth, there would still need to be people serving the food you eat, and stocking the shelves. Hence, Essential Workers.\n\nYou take that away, and society collapses.\n\nSome joke that these jobs will be replaced by robots, and I welcome that! Displace billions of people, and see what happens next.\n\nI dare you.\n\nAnyway, happy chrimas, and have a merry chrysler.\n"

    "content": "There are a lot of good arguments as to why you shouldn’t be on Threads, or any Meta-owned social media, for that matter. Zuck is storing your info, selling it to advertisers, and using it to tailor ads to you to be ever-more invasive in your digital life. And, you know, who knows what else. If you’re nearing the age of 40, like me, you’ve probably already had a Facebook account, and can probably also remember when it first opened its doors to the masses (oh god, am I old?) But, should you be there? Is it too late?\n\nEveryone knows I love Mastodon, despite the issues I’ve had with a handful of instances who have treated my presence … not so well. The open internet, tied to protocols and Linux, is the future. And there’s no way around that. So much so, Meta recognizes this, and is still actively working on its full integration of ActivityPub (even though many see it as a ploy to vacuum up the data of fediverse users).\n\nDespite that, many instances are blocking Threads.net. My instance wasn’t, and then was, and now isn’t, again. Why?\n\nI’m someone who sort of, subjects my online presence to testing new things, and then writing about it, on sort of a frequent basis. If you’re reading this, and you’ve been reading my blog for a while now, you probably remember when I jumped into Nostr for a while … and then later discovered that, despite a few cool people, it’s mostly just Bitcoin addicts, and extremists who want to say slurs, unhindered. And you also probably already know, I’ve tried Bluesky multiple times, to the tune of being harassed by jerks on multiple occasions, for seemingly no reason.\n\nAnd I remain an instance admin on ActivityPub, despite its personal cost to my wallet, because I feel this is the best answer to my online presence … or is it?\n\nI recently shared a post on Threads that currently has half a million views and 1,600 likes. That’s … a lot.\n\nI’ve also been sharing my work, and then things I do, on Mastodon, for months, uh … years, actually. And, for a while, I could say that most of the support I ever see for any of my work, be it music, coding, or writing, has been from Mastodon.\n\nBut, I can’t deny, that lately, in the past couple of months, it’s starting to look like that may no longer end up being the case. Albeit, I haven’t really shared much of my work on Threads, but if a post in support of Luigi Mangione can get half a million impressions, then surely I could find a way to put my next album, or book, in front of just as many eyes.\n\nWhich brings me to an impasse.\n\nI’m very stringent about committing to Linux, committing to open source, and privacy, and taking back the internet. But, at exactly the same time, I want to make a future for myself that involves the extracurricular work that I do at home becoming my main source of income. And if I’m seeing months of next to no reaction to those things on the platform that I actually want to commit to, what am I supposed to think?\n\nDo I just really suck at being interesting? Are the things I do just not interesting to the average Joe, or average Mastodon user?\n\nOf course, I’m not just on Mastodon to share my work. I’m there to talk. connect, build, make friends. But it’s also very important that what I do is seen by people, you know? And this isn’t to say that there’s no one on Mastodon. There are plenty of people there. Somewhere around 15-20 million people.\n\nAnd then also at the same time, that post with half the population of a town viewing it, this hasn’t really resulted in any … results? For my presence there? I don’t have half a million follows. I’m not noticing a huge uptick in traffic to my website.\n\nJust now someone on Mastodon tells me, that Meta clout is more akin to gambling, than anything. And you know, that’s probably completely correct.\n\nI don’t know. Maybe it’s something that I’m overthinking. Maybe I should walk away from Meta. But, as much as I’m capable of doing my offline job now, I may not always be capable, and eventually I’m going to need something else. And I really need that something else to be the things I’ve already been doing, for years.\n\n"

Since I have very many posts on this site, and there’s only going to be more, now you can just type in something interesting, like “linux,” and you’ll get everything I’ve ever written on here that includes the phrase.\n\nGenius!\n\nIt actually works kind of in the same way my “poast to mastodon” script works, for when I publish new posts, except it’s not posting to Mastodon, and it is instead generating URLs for search results regarding every single post on this site, each time I build and serve, locally.\n\nNow, it’s not as robust and broken, and also horrible as Google.

    "content": "Some people weren’t around for what happened in 2014, and the “initialization” of “gamergate” that would, seemingly, never go away (see this link for more information). But I was there (and this is why I say that Twitter was never actually good), and I remember what the discourse and shitposting looked like. And it looked … a lot like what we’re seeing today, when new games are announced, and it’s starring a woman. Words have evolved a bit, since then, and we mostly call these guys incels. But, what’s the problem now? What games are the never-gonna-get-laid guys worried about?\n\nFirst, we have The Witcher 4, where Ciri will be taking up the lead role.\n\n\n\nPretty awesome right? The best character in The Witcher 3 is getting her own game? Frick yeah, bro!\n\nBut, this is, apparently, a problem now?\n\nThese people don’t want to “play as a woman”, or they think Ciri looks old now. Honestly, I think she looks like she’s in her thirties, and that’s … uh, fine?\n\nCD Project Red addressed these people, and I think even their response is a bit too tame for my liking. Quoted via Gamerant:\n\n\nRegarding those fans who simply don't want to play as a woman, the narrative director noted that the lore of The Witcher 4 will continue to follow the dark fantasy themes already present in the series. He pointed out that past games have addressed tough times for marginalized groups, such as non-humans, and said while Ciri's gender will play a factor in the story, it won't be the main focus.\n\n\nAnd, in order to back up what I’m talking about, I had to go dig up an example of the bile from Twitter, because I don’t inherently save screenshots of every nasty thing I see online. But, I mean, this is what I’m talking about, that CDPR very luke-warm-ish, are addressing:\n\nAll the shills are out hyping up Witcher 4. All the honest people saw they made the main character a woman who breaks lore in her new role AND who was made significantly uglier than she used to be. Both are red flags for an extremely woke game. pic.twitter.com/tVPRkssFBT— Mr. Reality (@MrReality_sp) December 13, 2024\n\n\nIt’s true, some people might be uncomfortable with Geralt giving up the helm to the series, but also? This woman isn’t ugly? I mean, I would never go so far as to call anyone ugly, because bla bla bla, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But, if we’re talking brass tacks here: Ciri is hot, and very not “ugly.”\n\nThe biggest thing I’m worried about in regard to Witcher 4, is whether or not it’s going to be a buggy mess on launch.\n\nAnd this isn’t even close to the backlash Last of Us game director’s next new IP is receiving. Yes, you’ve probably heard about this already. It’s probably all over every feed you visit on a daily basis.\n\n“Naughty Dog’s new game starring a woman or nonbinary person, who is bald and sips a soda, now has larger dislike ratio than Concord.”\n\n\n\nI’m a big fan of space and scifi games. Not sure I’m a fan of hack and slash as much though, unless we’re talking Diablo. I love Diablo.\n\nBut, again, the shitcourse continues. This actually took me more than ten minutes to find, on Twitter, which says to me that the backlash may be slightly manufactured. And this isn’t even the worst thing I’ve seen being said (maybe I do need to start saving screenshots of the nasty bile people spew about games and women within them):\n\nIntergalactic's lead chick looks like a recovering addict. Sunken eyes, bad teeth and skin, ghetto outfit, nasty attitude.I get wanting to be realistic, but this is also fiction. A character on the run doesn't have to look like they just got hit by the Whomping Willow. Her… pic.twitter.com/DlG3qT2fqk— Leon @ RPG Haven (@rpg_haven) December 19, 2024\n\n\nAgain, I don’t really see it. I don’t see what the issue is. You know what I see when I look at this protagonist?\n\n\n\nDon’t get me wrong, maybe Intergalactic will just be an unfun game, or maybe it’ll be a new classic! I don’t know. What I do know, is that a character’s appearance, like, physical appearance, has never been the reason that a game has failed or succeeded.\n\nDo you know why Mass Effect Andromeda bombed? It wasn’t because Sara Ryder wasn’t wearing pink lipstick. It wasn’t because Peebee didn’t resemble Liara enough.\n\n\n\nIt was because these same types of mother-frikkers rallied against the game for having very very slight mentions of transgender-related themes, and some flubs in animations that somehow made it past QA. And because these types operate in crypto-fascist, hide-the-motive style of language, and posting, it was painted as an issue with the game, overall, just not working and being bad in-general. Some even went so far as to edit footage from the early game, before its release, in order to manipulate public perception of it.\n\nYou may have seen things like this on Tumblr and Twitter back in 2017 (and no, there is no way I’m going to be able to find reference for this anymore, especially since Tumblr staff nuked my account). Choppy cuts in video form of animations that appear to be backwards or wrong, in every cut, unless you had a good eye, and could see where images and cutscenes were being misrepresented. I’m talking intentionally slowing down silence between narrative, cutting back and forth between multiple characters in the midst of a conversation to give the appearance of amateur design.\n\nI’m still mad about this, because it was this backlash, this manipulation of perception, that caused BioWare to abandon the game shortly after release, and immediately jump to work on the also now abandoned, Anthem.\n\nThe real issue with Andromeda, was that a lot of the game’s polish was sacrificed to make pointlessly open-ended planets that were far too large. That’s it. It was actually an alright game, if you ignored that part.\n\nBut, I don’t think it’s diverse characters that are or will destroy the gaming industry. I think it’s these guys. I think the smoldering remains of gamergate, or incels, as most would say, are going to singlehandedly kill the entire industry. Much the same way they’ve killed Twitter, alongside their new boss, Felon Busk. We can’t just have games with women in them. We can’t just have games where making sure a chronically online right-wing extremist has masturbatory material isn’t the main goal. No.\n\nNuh uh.\n\nEvery game has to be fappable to people who have bad taste in beauty aesthetics, or it’s the gaming apocalypse.\n\n"

    "content": "A long time ago, in an age far, far away … Ten years ago, to be exact. And, keeping within the theme of traveling back in time to the world of Tumblr fandoms and Gamergate, it’s time we switched gears to the once growing “trans exclusionary radical feminist” movement, and the spectrum of hate and transphobia that came with it. Today, we’re talking about a book that was published in 2014, called Adam.\n\n\n\nThe synopsis is as follows:\n\n\nWhen Adam Freedman — a skinny, awkward, inexperienced teenager from Piedmont, California — goes to stay with his older sister Casey in New York City, he is hopeful that his life is about to change. And it sure does.\n\nIt is the summer of 2006. Gay marriage and transgender rights are in the air, and Casey has thrust herself into a wild lesbian subculture. Soon Adam is tagging along to underground clubs, where there are hot older women everywhere he turns. It takes some time for him to realize that many in this new crowd assume he is trans—a boy who was born a girl. Why else would this baby-faced guy always be around?\n\nThen Adam meets Gillian, the girl of his dreams — but she couldn’t possibly be interested in him. Unless passing as a trans guy might actually work in his favor . . .\n\nAriel Schrag’s scathingly funny and poignant debut novel puts a fresh spin on questions of love, attraction, self-definition, and what it takes to be at home in your own skin.\n\n\nThis had a movie accompanying it that released in 2019, wherein the extremely flawed premise of a guy pretending to be trans in order to sleep with a lesbian caught fire like a volcano on Twitter (and you may also note, the premise describes Adam as a teenager).\n\nAnd then it was summarily forgotten in about a week.\n\nThese themes and premises also align with things TERFs believe, or talk about. But, it’s been so long since these types have really seen the light of day, at least, in the way they did back in 2014 across the earlier versions of the sites we’re all stuck on (well, maybe not stuck). You can read more about who they are and what they believe, here.\n\nAnd, maybe this book isn’t exclusively anything to do with trans exclusionary radfems, but it’s definitely in the spaces of something that sits in the same arena as, “men wearing dresses pretending to be women entering spaces where they don’t belong,” except, in this instance, the role is reversed. The role is reversed, and it places transgender men in a light wherein they have something in common with lesbians, therein aligning them as women who look and act like men.\n\nObviously, this isn’t good, or excusable, to write a story where something like this is painted as fun, uplifting, and “liberating.” Transphobia is literally the gasoline that’s fueling the modern fascist movement. And pretending that trans men are just women, whom’st lesbians can be interested in, romantically and sexually involved with, is both transphobic and homophobic. At least … if you actually align yourself with transgender people, in that they are who they say they are.\n\nNow, stay with me here, what’s that quote at the top of the book’s cover read? Did you see that?\n\n\n\"The sexual revolution is finally over, and Ariel Schrag has won.\" - Alison Bechdel\n\n\nWho’s Alison Bechdel, though?\n\nDuring the emergence of Gamergate, there was also a lot of talk about representation in gaming and other media, specifically about how women are represented and written. In that, they’re usually written badly, and usually to the benefit of a male character, for the male reader’s personal sexual “gaze” or enjoyment.\n\nIf you’re an older netizen like myself, you may remember Anita Sarkeesian and the extreme amount of vitriol she faced whenever she talked about these things, usually, specifically, in relation to gaming. You may also remember Zoe Quinn, whom is thought to be where, why, and how Gamergate “started,” i.e., in backlash against her. You can read much more about all of that here.\n\nBut then, there also emerged a guideline of sorts that served and still serves as a litmus test for gauging old, new, and upcoming media for their literacy in representing women.\n\nThis test is known as The Bechdel Test.\n\n\nThe Bechdel test (/ˈbɛkdəl/ BEK-dəl),[1] also known as the Bechdel-Wallace test, is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The test asks whether a work features at least two female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. Some versions of the test also require that those two female characters have names.\n\n\nNow, I’m not saying this “test” of sorts doesn’t have any merit. There is a lot of merit in gauging these things, and determining if media is actually good, especially in this day and age, where Bad Things are getting more bad. But, I can’t quite put my finger on why someone who gave such an endorsement, to such a terrible piece of media, that absolutely betrays her own test, women, and the entire trans community, and was so proud of it, that it was featured on the front of the book … is still being celebrated.\n\nAnd I wanted to finally bring a more permanent light to this, because I’ve been talking about it for a decade, to an internet that forgets everything it thinks it cares about faster than the speed of light, and I’ve been doing that on social media websites like, Twitter, Bluesky, Tumblr, all this time. And, whether you think I belong to any community or not doesn’t matter. It matters that critical thinking doesn’t die, and it matters more that we consider those we’re promoting and uplifting.\n\nAlison Bechdel isn’t special. She’s just as flawed as any of us, and maybe she’s not Cathy Brennan, but maybe we can think of a new name for litmus testing media for actual interesting female characters, that doesn’t involve the name of someone who endorsed media where a man pretends to be transgender in order to sleep with a lesbian.\n\n"

    "content": "We’ve all recently come to the conclusion that billionaires and CEOs don’t really care what you think of them, or what they do. And Mark Zuckerberg continues to provide glaring examples of why that’s true. From his sanitized Second Life clone, Horizons, to the present day, with AI generated social media users. It’s not just a question of, “Who the hell asked for this?” But also a question of, “What in the world is the point of filling social media with fake people who don’t exist that reply to things without logical reasoning?” Well … uh, we’re all asking that question.\n\n\n     View on Threads\n\n\n\nI have a complicated relationship with Meta. Like I spoke about before, in a previous post, I’ve had a Facebook account since it was brand new, and even if I were to delete it, they have everything about me, ever, and they’ll likely never relinquish that information. And, at the same time, I do tend to enjoy some mindless scrolling on Reels, or pretending that I’m a regular normal social media user on Threads, as I watch Zuck make the worst decisions possible to impress people who he has imagined in his own mind. And yes, I own a Meta Quest 2, which has been gathering dust in a drawer for about three months (VR Chat has slipped out of my zone of interest).\n\nThis also probably sounds extremely contrary, or in opposition to my hefty support of ActivityPub, and Mastodon, especially because I run my own instance. But, as a creator of things, and if you create things as well (art, fiction, etc), you already know, that you must maintain a presence in as many places as possible. It’s part of the game. And it’s a shitty game, that I do not enjoy.\n\nBut, to bring the topic back to the embedded Threads post, Zuckerberg imagines a social media where there are millions and billions of AI agents, i.e., fake people. To no one’s surprise, just about every single person learning of this news is asking, “What in the hell is this good for?”\n\nTaken from an annoyingly milquetoast article over at Rolling Stone:\n\n\n The prospect seems an unusual one for websites predicated on the idea of human-to-human interaction. While Meta’s other AI offerings, including photo-editing tools, a ChatGPT-like text bot, and forthcoming software for producing AI-generated video, have more readily obvious appeal, it’s far from certain that an Instagram or Facebook populated by virtual apparitions would prove enticing to newcomers or satisfying for long-time users. Meta revealed to FT that users have created “hundreds of thousands of characters” since AI Studio launched in July, but that most of them remain private. The company declined to comment further to Rolling Stone. \n\n\nThe question remains: What value does this provide? You’re melting the ice caps in order to put fake people on social media, that you’re already aware people don’t like, for what reason? Are you going to sell people AI blocking software as a solution to a problem that you yourselves have created? Is that the end goal here?\n\nYou see, I come from the 90s. And in the 90s, we had very, very primitive chatbots. Chatbots that responded to trigger words with predefined text. This is something that you can now build by yourself with like 5 minutes of Python. Hardly anyone thought it was cool then, and it definitely isn’t cool now.\n\nIt’s not cool, because most people are online and on social media, to meet, and talk to real people. To make friends. To make connections. What connection are you making with an AI ghost on Facebook?\n\nAm I missing a piece of the human genome that makes something like this exciting?\n\nI must be.\n\nYou can go and see one of these “characters” on Facebook, now. And, if you’re feeling extra funny, you can use Facebook’s own reporting tools to report the entire account for being a fake person. It’s literally there, in the reporting dialogue.\n\n\n\nThis is, at least, a great reason to entice regular people to finally, please for the love of god, join a fediverse instance. If we can move the digital world to ActivityPub, on user-owned servers, then maybe artists, and writers, and musicians can feel like they don’t have to be on these data farms anymore, just to gamble and get a 10% boost in exposure while bots are scraping everything they say so that AI generated Jimmy Carter can say, “Hey John, did you buy that Apple Watch you were talking about yesterday?”\n"

Many stay in their homes idling by themselves, or atop “platforms” 3000 meters up in the air, only socializing with one or two people they know personally. The virtual world has never been more disconnected as a social platform, for reasons … uh, that I’m not quite sure of. But, no need to fear! Linden Labs is alpha testing an AI character creator so that your friends can be as fake as your imagination!\n\n\n\nPictured in the screenshot is a dialogue that says, “Your own personal bot intended to accompany you as you explore the world, bond with you, and interact mostly or only with you.” Because, it’s not like Second Life was, and has always been, a 3D virtual chat application. A place where you’re supposed to meet people, form friendships, and build together. No, absolutely not. This is a single-player virtual world, where the bonds you form are as contrived, meaningless, and embarrassing as asking Google’s Gemini if it loves you.\n\nIntroduced by Darcy Linden via an official blog post:\n\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with Convai, the Character Designer empowers you to craft, customize, and animate virtual characters within Second Life. This tool is intended for developers, community builders, roleplay enthusiasts, and anyone looking to enhance their inworld experiences through dynamic characters. \n\n\nRoleplay enthusiasts! Now you don’t have to stand around in a group of five people in a city crafted by the hands of creators, writing ten paragraph long scenes for each other to immerse yourselves within while you create stories. Now, you’ll be able to replace all of those people and unique moments with plagiarism bots! OH BOY.\n\nJust like with any other company that has suddenly decided to force AI into their products, we can only assume that this is happening because the CEO behind Linden Labs has demanded it. And, also, in every circumstance that this has happened within in the past year, I’ll ask the same question: Can we fire whoever’s responsible for this? Before it becomes the nail in the coffin that completely ruins what has been a place of discovery and friendship for decades?\n\nLinden Labs: You want to bolster the community, reinvigorate the userbase? Take notes from VR Chat. Make creation and building easier. Realize that not everything should require a user whip out their wallet, and give new users something actually cool. Lower the cost of hosting your own server from 250 USD per month, to something more within the realm of sanity, at, say, 14.99 a month.\n\nOr, go the desperate CEO route, and inject generative slop into Second Life. Watch it finally die, so that every person on Reddit who asks, “Isn’t Second Life dead?” can finally be correct.\n"

I want to pay down this debt that I incurred from veterinarians more than three years ago now. I want to … find work in a tech field! Even if that may be even more impossible than it was six months ago. And, most of all, I want to revitalize my Patreon. Here’s why …\n\nI’ve been running my Patreon since October 2014. It has been … a very long time. Ten years! And in that time, I’ve posted downloadable releases of my very first book I ever self published, and then two more that came after. I have over twenty musical releases up, that I’ve posted about over the years, and you can download all of them (as a paid member). I have posts containing spotlights and information about nearly everything I’ve ever put into my Second Life store, and then I also have regular updates that include my blog posts (which have been on multiple websites since then).\n\nThere was a time when my paid subscribers reached the height of thirty active subs, and then, over time, I lost focus, bad things happened in the synthwave scene, and a lot of them left.\n\nI’m going to put this out there, though: I appreciate every single person who has been on my Patreon, is there, and/or is even just following for free (except for Czarina, she was only subscribed for selfish reasons that she could later hold over my head in the midst of her retaliation to my outspoken views on the transphobia within the synthwave scene).\n\nOn the topic of my Patreon, though, I did sort of stop updating it for a little bit of 2024. I thought I could move to Ko-fi, or other sites like it, because for a while it did feel easier to provide updates on things I’ve been doing, and creating. But … most of the sites that are like Patreon, are kind of also missing a lot of the features Patreon has. And … why abandon something I’ve been using for ten years?\n\nIt may as well be an archive of everything I’ve ever done, right?\n\nI currently have a Python script running on a remote server that posts a snippet of information about my Patreon to my Mastodon account once daily, and I wanted to write this post, as well, to give a little bit of deeper insight. One of the things I was doing, that got me to where I used to be (before I returned to the offline work-world), was that I shared what I do, and what I create, on a daily basis. Sometimes multiple times a day.\n\nSince I returned to offline work, I’ve really slacked on actually sharing what I do, and I feel like that’s a big contributor as to why, even with having a bestselling darksynth album, I’ve kind of sifted into the background noise a bit.\n\nBut, you should sign up to: support what I do, help me get out of this friggin’ debt, and, also? Help me leave retail work once and for all.\n\nThat’s it. That’s the goal.\n"

    "content": "So, last week, I wrote about Meta inadvertently planning to confirm the “Dead Internet Theory,” with cringy fake people (AI bots), and how enthusiastic the Zuck was about all of this, despite there being no value, or any verifiable reason for it all to exist. And, almost immediately afterward, scores of people began planning their move away from Threads across the platform (post-2023 social media is just a game of digital hot potato). Other users scoured Instagram and Facebook to find a slew of 20 some bots … including a fake black woman pretending to have a family, and culture.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, these weren’t actually the bots that Meta was planning to implement, rather, they were experiments from over a year ago that nobody noticed and/or completely ignored, until Mark started to bring attention to his next, biggest, worst decision. These profiles are now deleted, as complaints were made against the accounts … because you couldn’t block them, and due to major backlash, in-general.\n\nVia 404 Media:\n\n\n\"There is confusion: the recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product,\" Sweeney said. \"The accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters. We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.” \n\n\nBut, the aforementioned “Liv” wasn’t Meta’s only experiment with making racist caricatures, as Threads user krenaep details, with a completely different, and also now deleted account, named “Jade.”\n\n\n     View on Threads\n\n\n\nIt seems these bots were completely willing to de-mask their creators, showing us that both of these accounts, and the others, were all constructed by a team of mostly white guys. Which, and I’m not a genius or anything, but, looks real bad, chief. But it does further the conversation as to what exactly the goal was, or is with these things. Some have said the the goal is to “drive engagement,” but, to what end, and how? You going to use AI to boost real human beings?\n\nOr, you’re going to ask content creators to use your AI tools in order to develop caricatures of themselves that can interact with people for them, thereby discouraging human interaction on a social media platform. Because if there’s anything billionaires hate more than losing a single cent to paying their goddamn taxes, it’s regular, real human beings, who still have functioning frontal lobes. And the assumption, is, I guess, that everyone else must be like this, too.\n\n\n\nIn the age of tomfoolery, and fuckery, and generative slop that guzzles gallons of fresh water every single time you make a prompt, I think it’s important to begin the move away from corporate social media. If you can. Albeit, I do exist on Meta social media, and that’s entirely for my own reasons–I’m conflicted, and I have work that I’d like to reach more than a few handfuls of people with, because I don’t want to work retail for the rest of my natural life, until I’m replaced by an AI bot that will inevitably hallucinate that I was never actually born.\n\nBut, this is your regular reminder that user-owned social media exists, and you have full control over the things you see, and interact with online … even if Meta will never truly delete or relinquish your data, no matter what you do with your accounts. And if we can get people en-masse to move to the protocol mentioned below, then maybe even more people will feel like they don’t have to keep one foot in the digital hell, and the other in the place where they actually want to be.\n\nWays to join Mastodon:\n\n\n  \n    Check out mastodon.social, the flagship instance that has the most people on it. This is good for people who don’t want to bother looking through different servers and simply want to give the place a try.\n  \n  \n    Check out my instance, and submit a join request (please type a legible reason for joining with your request, so that I can distinguish you from bots).\n  \n  \n    Or, surf through numerous different ActivityPub instances that span even more than just Mastodon.\n  \n\n"

    "content": "We’ve all seen it at this point: Chronic shitposters (largely coming from Bluesky) using AI generated imagery to poke fun at the incoming administration, or generative slop users themselves. And, every single time, I imagine these people think they’re doing something productive, or revolutionary, or funny. But here’s the news flash: You’re not. If you wouldn’t use blockchain tech, or buy NFTs in 2022, then you shouldn’t be generating sludge as a joke, either.\n\nSituations like this remind of me old Mastodon instances in the pre-2020 era of the fediverse, that were erected solely for “shitposting.” They start out funny, or mildly annoying (because, let’s face it, if the only thing you ever post is incoherent jokes, you become tiring after about a day), and usually mostly politically left-leaning. Then, the jokes get worse, and worse. And suddenly, the instance is being flooded with neo nazis and predators, because you decided that ironic fascist jokes weren’t over-the-line. And now you’re just no different than them.\n\nI can just vaguely recall Mastodon instances that were shutdown within months of opening, such as bofa.lol, kazink, and so on. And shitposters.club, a currently active server that is instance-blocked by most instances across the fediverse. All guilty of exactly the same things.\n\nWhy do I bring up this comparison?\n\nPartially, because I have a personal grudge against people whose entire personality is shitty jokes (see: the monumentally huge amount of harassment I’ve received on Bluesky for practically no reason at all, from people who have bad taste in humor and politics). But also, because this is an extremely predictable pipeline that always leads to opening the door for undesirables (fascists, crypto-brained losers, sludge-enjoyers).\n\nThis isn’t even the only reason you shouldn’t do this, though! Making yourself indistinguishable from people who have no qualms with the destruction of human creativity, and art is, bad enough, but then you also have to take into account the harm you’re causing the actual literal planet every single time you make a prompt.\n\nQuote from watertech.com:\n\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) quickly went from a neat parlor trick to a business imperative. IBM reports that 82% of large enterprises have either deployed AI or are experimenting with doing so. Unlike other technology innovations like smartphones or WiFi networks, AI isn’t a one-time integration. The technology is constantly evolving with new models and capabilities.\n\n\nEach time these AI tools are prompted, there’s a cost that few consider. Researchers believe that each string of prompts uses roughly 16 ounces of water at data centers that house these AI systems. Extrapolate AI use globally, and it’s clear how water systems are taxed. Microsoft’s latest environmental report shows its water consumption jumped 34% from 2021 to 2022, reaching nearly 1.7 billion gallons. Google reports its water consumption went up nearly 22% over the same period to a staggering 5.56 billion gallons, about 800 times as big as The Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool.\n\n\nAnd that doesn’t even mention the carbon dioxide generated from the fossil-fuel powered electricity that we use, that has already been melting the ice caps for about fifty to sixty years, or more.\n\nSome of these people might argue that you do the same amount of harm by charging your smartphone, or running a microwave. But, if that’s true (and those were just crude examples), why in the world would you feel it necessary to double the harm you’re doing by generating some uncanny-valley sludge in response to racist propaganda?\n\nOK, it's AI...but much truer than Haitians eating your dogs and cats![image or embed]— eugene (@eugene290390.bsky.social) January 5, 2025 at 9:22 PM\n\n\nOh, I see, it’s funny, because Donald Trump is just a drooling baby and Elon Musk is the actual sitting president. Ah.\n\nAnd you couldn’t have dictated your little joke with words, and a little bit of stock footage? Or, remembered that Joe Biden is still currently in the White House (as of posting this)?\n\nTo give some closing perspective, here are some websites and communities that have been willingly (by their creators) destroyed by generative AI.\n\n\n  \n    DeviantArt: Once a place for artists to share their work, and even sell it, now overrun by inauthentic slop.\n  \n  \n    Etsy: Once a place for creatives to make money off of the things they make, and do, now a place where you can use algorithmically stolen work, that can’t legally even be copyrighted to make money off the backs of those same exact people.\n  \n  \n    NaNoWriMo: Once a fun community event about writing for yourself a 50,000 word novel in the month of November, now fully endorses plagiarism bots. And this is a special case, because they originally called those who are against AI ableist, for not wanting plagiarism and creative theft in writing spaces. And then they doubled back and deleted that statement, and edited it to talk down to those critical of AI as if they’re our angry parents.\n  \n\n\nAnd that’s just to name a few. There are many more spaces and communities that either have already been destroyed by the continuing enshitification of anything good that’s left in the world, by big tech companies, or those that are currently being targeted. This is why so many people have been fleeing corporate social media. And the last thing you should do, is bring it with you, in the form of bad jokes and a vitriolic personality, just to be ironic on Bluesky, or even Mastodon.\n\nDon’t be that douche.\n"

That’s a big oof on my part.\n\nStill with all the same products, and room to add more, you can now find my Second Life store, in-world, here.\n\nI made this move, because I wasn’t too happy with the tiny amount of space I had in the old spot, and I was shuffling around expenses and found out … I’ve been paying Linden Labs for a large amount of land for probably well over a year, unknowingly. Being that, I somehow forgot that I was doing this. So, I moved everything around, found a new location, put the store online in that new location, and then turned off all transactions on my alt account.\n\nNow … the only account paying for anything, should be the account running the store!\n\nWhew.\n\nAnyway, on-wards and forwards into the new year!\n"

    "content": "We all (or most of us) remember when Musk took over Twitter. People got fired, the website became increasingly unstable, the algorithm got tweaked to be less “biased” toward fascist propaganda, lies, and hate, and then everyone left in droves. Then, in response to this, Meta launched Threads, a Twitter alternative. And it was actually nice … for a time. About a year ago. But then Trump got elected, and like billionaires do, Marky Knuckleburger decided that it was time to pander, by eliminating safe-guards against the exact same things that turned Twitter into 4chan 2.\n\n\n     View on Threads\n\n\n\nI’m not saying that community notes on Twitter have been a bad thing, because they’ve actually been pretty funny when its been used against liars and people who fabricate situations in order to embolden hate. But, it’s the context, and the reasons you have to look at. Mack Fucklenarg has never been genuine or progressively-inclined about anything he’s ever done. From building The Facebook, which was originally a website used to rate the “hotness” of girls in college, to seemingly condemning the acts of the January 6th terrorists.\n\n\n\nThis was, and you guessed it, manipulative pandering to the incoming administration.\n\nFark Bafflenard doesn’t have any core beliefs. Like all billionaires, he follows the money, and he follows his own interests in not wanting to be potentially arrested and imprisoned by the currently incoming administration. It is only a complete coincidence if your beliefs and your virtues ever line up with what Mark Zugzugsomethingneeddoing is currently doing, or saying.\n\nRight now, those actions are lining up with the same criminals and potential mass shooters that Twitter harbors. And that’s a bad thing. A bad thing for people who enjoy posting within a civilized atmosphere that at least attempts to pretend that we’re living in 2025, and not 1825.\n\nIf, in 4 years, a straight-up communist is somehow elected, I’m almost entirely sure that Marky-Mark would make statements on how Meta and its properties will release control of its production means to its users.\n\nIt’s just as pathetic as Diamond-Mine Musk using memes from 15 years ago in an attempt to impress neo nazis who are in their 40s and 50s.\n\nMen who go through life believing in nothing, who hold insurmountable amounts of power over mass amounts of people, will be the downfall of civilized society.\n\nBut, despite all of Meta’s mistakes, its family of apps hold more than 3.98 billion users (as of February 1st, 2024), and that’s a staggering amount of people. That’s about half of the entire world’s popu-frikken-lation. And while I’ve seen the usual round of people promising they’re moving to Bluesky (which is honestly not even much better of a platform), I don’t think there is any way in any shape or form, that you will ever convince half the world’s population to join Mastodon, or even the Twitter-carbon-copy, Bluesky.\n\nLike with most things, the average user only cares about ease of use, and if you can sign up for Threads by already having an Instagram account, that eliminates the process of even just setting up an account. You’re already there! An advantage that Meta has over all other platforms. And this is why I think it is incredibly important that Mastodon, and other ActivityPub apps and projects, work toward simplifying the onboarding process even more than they already have.\n\nIt is imperative to get as many people off of propaganda platforms as humanly possible, because, the annoying people from 2017 Tumblr … were correct, after-all.\n\n\n"

    "content": "As per my last post this morning (in regard to Meta’s loosening of moderation, as if it wasn’t already loose enough), I, as the admin of mkultra.monster, will be blocking federation with Threads. For a long period of time, I hadn’t been doing this, partially because I don’t like bandwagons, and also because there are regular, decent people on Threads that I personally wanted to see. But, now it’s a bit more than a lost cause, and the social network is nothing but a detriment to the open social web.\n\nThe people I liked seeing updates from will just have to move to Mastodon, or some other fediverse software.\n\nBut, the other reason I wanted to post this, is because there are a lot of people who trot out their reasoning, or why they’ve blocked them from the start. Whether it’s performative or not, I remained skeptical for a long period of time. Skeptical, because I have experience from within the fediverse of numerous people, moderators, and admins saying one thing, or that they stand for one thing, and then they do the opposite.\n\nAnd this has made me more critical, more skeptical, and more distrusting of others.\n\nYes, I have spoken about this before, but since it’s been about a year or so (or more?) since this all happened, I want to again bring light to the actions of the administrator and moderation team behind the Mastodon instance … hackers.town.\n\nIt was some time around August 25th of 2023, that I was posting on my timeline over at HT about … I don’t know, something to do with how resilient my Macbook was. I was kind of stanning Apple real hard around that time, just because I enjoyed/liked their hardware. Never-the-less, a user by the name of 0xSH00T (who now, at least, appears to be banned and erased, over a year later) jumped in to make some vitriolic remarks about myself, my having posted on the timeline, and my choice in hardware.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to get angry about, and it was a stupid thing to troll someone over.\n\nHe escalated, I escalated, and I don’t claim to be of perfect cognitive or mental health. I have my issues, and I deal with them.\n\nI told him, and I quote, “Go fuck yourself, eat a pile of dicks and delete your goddamn account.”\n\nYes, this is kind of … haha, ANGRY.\n\nAnd I had every right to be.\n\nIn a direct message that no longer contains the originating message from the admin (@thegibson), I responded, “I’m here minding my own business mostly just talking to myself, and this person comes into my mentions swinging, I’m not tolerating any both sides-ing bullshit. Delete the instigator or I’m out.”\n\nBecause, he and his mod-team, very much were playing the “both sides” card. In response to a troll, who was, in fact, instigating a fight.\n\nI didn’t really want to leave hackers.town (and I wouldn’t have, anyway, I just wanted the troll to, at minimum, be moderated). I was in a blood-haze, and kind of spiraling a bit. Just like when it happened on the instance over at deadinsi.de, where just about the same things had gone on, and the admin and moderator team had a lapse in judgment. That’s … that’s what we’ll call it, I guess.\n\nI made an off-the-cuff post about PTSD, I told Gibson again something like, “either you ban this asshole, or you ban me” and rather than doing any real moderation work, I was, of course, banned.\n\nThis was not the outcome I thought would take place. At least not at the time.\n\nAgain, I was spiraling. I was in a much worse mental place than I am now.\n\nOf course, I shouldn’t have been banned. If someone is having a break in mental health, and spiraling out (crashing out, as the zoomers would say) over being harassed over and over, as a responsible administrator, or moderator, you take action against the instigator, no matter the personal relationship you hold with them.\n\nOver this tiny, insignificant instance of abuse, I lost years of my presence on the fediverse, indefinitely. There were never any talks or apologies once the dust had settled. There was never any further action taken, appeals never read, never looked at, never considered. And yet, for whatever reason, my account still stands, frozen in time (suspended, but viewable), and now linking to my account on my own instance … where this type of thing will never happen.\n\nYou cannot call yourself an instance, a server, that is tolerant, and forward-thinking, and “for the people,” if your personal relationships come first. Especially if those personal relationships are with instigative assholes who shouldn’t exist on your platform. This is going to sound really self-absorbed, but I am a better administrator and moderator than anyone at hackers.town by 1000 miles, and I will stand by that, into the future. Because I will never let this happen.\n\nEven if my server is only ever myself, and one other person, trolls will never gain the upper-hand, because I will never make excuses for anyone who’s being a shit.\n\nAnd that’s why, when people start posting on the federated timeline, about how bad you are if you don’t, or haven’t had Threads blocked, I have to stop and question: Is there an ulterior motive here? Should I care what any of these people think? What have they done in their positions that they likely haven’t answered for?\n\nAnd, thankfully, in a lot of instances, none of this applies. They’re just thoughts … most of the time.\n\nBut there are people out there in the fediverse who are just as bad as the people you’d hope to escape by leaving Twitter, or Threads, and I think it’s important to realize that no place is perfect. The open social web, Mastodon, and ActivityPub is something I will continue to, and always support. But … it’s important to know that it’s not all just roses and candy.\n\nJerks, and people not fit to moderate, exist, everywhere.\n"

    "url": "/second-life/2025/01/09/second-life-no-you-don-t-get-to-dictate-what-creators-do.html",
    "content": "In Second Life, anyone can be a creator, and make their creations available to the virtual world for purchase, and some have found major success with this. Others, it exists, maybe, as more of a hobby. For me, that’s mostly what it is, for now. But this all comes with a downside, because, like in the real world, the customer sometimes thinks they know best, and if you’ve ever worked retail, you know how very wrong that is.\n\nI touched on this topic a little bit via Mastodon while I was on break at work, but I wanted to break it down in more detail, because this is a problem I see a lot of in Second Life. I’m not saying this is every person in the virtual world who buys things, but it is more or less, a pretty pervasive idea that I don’t think gets challenged enough. But, to break that down, basically, when people sell things in Second Life, you can sell it with permissions that allow a buyer to modify your content to their liking. You can also choose not to do this, in order to keep your work the way it is when it’s sold (especially if you want to sell different variations, which is, again, entirely up to the creator). Some people have a very big problem with the latter …\n\n\n\nThis is a screenshot of a Reddit post that got a lot of traction … a lot of people in agreement, and because Reddit is a place where dissenting opinions get buried and heckled, I felt it a good idea to write it all up here. So, let’s tear this apart, shall we?\n\n\nAs I'm customising my avatar more and getting more creative. I'm realising that there's no good reason for 99% of clothing to be non mod Perm (especially if it's a fatpack).\n\n\nA lot of this language will probably be pretty alien to people who don’t peruse Second Life, so … “fatpack” is something creators make that contain all variations of a certain product, such as a shirt. We’ll go with that. So, a creator makes a black shirt, and a white shirt, and then maybe five other colors, and they sell them all individually. Then, what they’ll do, is they’ll make a pack that contains all of them together, along with, maybe, a couple bonuses for buying that pack, i.e., a “fatpack.”\n\nI don’t see any real problem with this, but we’ll get into that when I’m done here.\n\nThis Redditor believes there’s “no good reason” for most clothing to not to be modifiable by the buyer. And I say, there is a good reason! If a creator wants to sell their virtual clothing in specific colors, patterns and textures, and not allow people to change this, that’s up to them! You are not the person running the store. You are not the person creating these things. And most of it is sold for prices below 2000 linden.\n\nA fatpack will usually run anywhere between 600 to 1200 linden. And maybe you’re thinking, “Whoa, is that expensive?”\n\nNo.\n\nSome people look at that pricing, within Second Life, and they’ll call it expensive. They always do. But why don’t we look at the actual exchange rate.\n\n\n\nSo … for less than a value meal at McDonalds, or a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can buy an entire set of clothing? For a little bit less than 5 dollars USD?\n\nAnother way to look at this, is that people are spending hours and hours on making clothing and accessories for people to buy, to customize their avatars, and to spice up their little virtual lives, for almost nothing. For less than a Fiverr gig. When, in the real world, if I were making you a custom 3D modeled product for a game, with complete textures, UV mapping, skeleton rigging, and weight painting … I would charge you at least 500 dollars.\n\nFortunately, we’re talking about Second Life, where all of that work is done behind-the-scenes, and people sell things at prices that are easily digestible to the masses, which, I think is beyond fair. It’s almost highway robbery.\n\n\nRemoving hidden faces, unliking and linking items is a must. Especially because you often start running against attachment limits.\n\n\nWe step into the next point of this user’s argument, in that, their perceived issue, is that clothing in link-sets should be able to be de-linked, because sometimes you run into an issue where your avatar has too many attachments, and you can’t wear something that you want. And, a linkset, is basically just gluing different items together so that they count more as one, but, even in doing that, they still cost server resources.\n\nSo you can only attach so many resources to your avatar until you hit that limit, you know, so that you don’t become a walking DDoS.\n\nBut … what’s the attachment limit in 2025, for a Second Life avatar?\n\nQuoted directly from the Second Life Wiki, “Max. # of attachments - 38 combined HUD and body attachments.”\n\nAn outfit someone might wear, will usually consist of a top, a bottom, and maybe shoes. So we’re talking … three to four attachment points. But then, of course, you have to account for your body, whether the hands and feet are separate, your hair, maybe custom eyes, and even fingernails.\n\nSo what would that run you?\n\nTo be generous, we’ll just say … 15. Even though that’s more than what I’ve listed, we’ll go with 15, to be fair to the original quoted post.\n\nYou’ve still got 23 additional attachment points.\n\nNow, some people like to wear HUDs, like body HUDs that make hiding texture faces on your body easier (although, I’m not sure why you would wear this at all times), or gaming HUDs, like a system that makes it so your avatar is a vampire, or sexual HUDs that make your virtual life a little more … spicy. And, of course, you probably walk around with the HUD for your head on, at least, sometimes, so that you can control your eye and mouth movements.\n\nBut … that’s like, maybe 3 to 5 more attachment points.\n\nYou’ve still got a lot to go.\n\nI can’t remember if server weight is counted in addition to attachment points, but we’ll just say, it is, and some of these attachments are taking up multiple points. Odds are, you’ve still got room to put more stuff on your avatar.\n\nMy point here, is that, in most cases, this is a complete non-issue, and it’s an excuse being made in order to aid the original argument. That creator’s should do what non-creator’s say, or else. And maybe you’re thinking, “Wh … what do you mean by that?”\n\nJust wait.\n\n\nWhen you're new, you don't care and I think it's a bit cash grabby to sell non mod Items with shiny branding pages and stores.\n\nThere are so many stores that are less shiny on the outside but their stuff is amazing and mod Perm.\n\n\nI’m going to tackle both of these points together, because this is already pretty long. So. This kind of circles back to my point on pricing, and how utterly entitled it is to say that creators in Second Life are pushing out “cash grabs” when they decide they want to sell specific colors and designs, that you can’t rip out and replace with … whatever.\n\nThat sounds, not just entitled, but … and this is a little ironic, but greedy.\n\nI’m not sure what being “new” has to do with this.\n\nBut then in their continued final point, basically, stores that aren’t flashy and less established are, apparently, more inclined to sell their products with the ability to tear things apart, and do with them whatever a customer pleases. And hey, that’s also fine! If someone wants to sell their products in a way that makes it so customers can do whatever they want, go ahead!\n\nThere is no wrong way to be a creator in Second Life, and you can do whatever you want, because it is your work.\n\nAnd now, we’re going to circle back to my comment that hinted at an ultimatum …\n\n\n\nSo, and this is also a point I’ve seen come up elsewhere, in that, and I’m going to be blunt, these entitled as all hell people, are trying to say that if a creator sells their work in a way that you can’t modify it, this incentivizes people to steal. To use ToS breaking scripts to rip your work out of Second Life, and to then re-upload it so that anything they want to do with it, can be done, for free.\n\nIt’s no secret that there are unscrupulous, grifting, uncreative, jerks out there in the world. We know this, especially now, because of generative AI. But to say that creators should let you tear their work apart, or have it stolen … That’s just ridiculous. It’s especially ridiculous, when you realize that there are people stealing work in Second Life, that costs, most of the time, less than five dollars to have.\n\nWhen I say, there are some petty, entitled people in Second Life, I mean it.\n\nA large majority of work sold on the Second Life marketplace goes for less than even a dollar, sometimes 30 to 50 cents!\n\nAnd there are people threatening to steal the work of these creators, because they want to color the shirt you made baby-puke green.\n\nI have enjoyed running a store in Second Life for 10 years, and I’ll continue to do so, in exactly the way that I want, with complete disregard for what people like this think. Because they need hobbies. They need things to occupy themselves.\n\nThey remind me of the people who walk into Walmarts with shitty attitudes, who yell at staff about pricing, and about item availability, and then stomp their feet and whine like a baby.\n\nBecause that’s what they are.\n"

    "content": "I get off of work, third day of my work week, whole body aching, staving off the pain with exactly three Ibuprofen and nothing else, and I log onto Second Life. Standing outside my static mansion on a hill that no one visits but me, because nobody else is allowed, I try to think of something interesting to write about. I do kind of tire of writing on negative topics, and topics I have to constantly cite with outbound links, screenshots, and facts. That stuff takes me such a long time to write. But today, I think I want to talk about ramen.\n\n\n\nIt took me an enormous amount of time in my life to finally have an actual good bowl of ramen, that wasn’t some bouillon chicken mess in a styrofoam cup. And that was … about three years ago. From a restaurant that, unfortunately, shutdown. I think they were called, Taste of Asia. And, although, I’ve never had the delight of going to Japan, or Korea, or Indonesia, I can say that if I did, I would eat ramen, first.\n\nI remember it like it was almost yesterday. I ordered a bowl of ramen through DoorDash, and it came in this giant plastic container, and it wasn’t just the noodles. It had all the garnish: the seaweed, the pork, the egg, the noodles, and the broth. For this, I had bought a pair of wooden chopsticks, just to feel like I was doing something authentic. And then I took the first bite.\n\nIt was like how I would imagine Gordon Ramsay feels when he takes a bite of Beef Wellington that’s done right. It was amazing (I am by no means comparing myself to Gordon Ramsay, I cannot cook, not like that). And it was at that moment that Top Ramen, and Maruchan became dead to me.\n\nIt was like, “Wow! Ramen is supposed … to be FLAVORFUL?!” And my god, it was.\n\nFlash forward to today, and I have specific instant ramen brands that I like, and I will not eat anything else.\n\nThose brands are Shin Black, Samyang Buldak, and Sapporo Ichiban.\n\nShin Black is a very deep flavor, with a spicy kick to it, and it’s only “failing,” if you can call it that, is that they add no MSG to it. There are a lot of misconceptions about MSG, and although, it is of course, not healthy, it’s mostly fine.\n\nMy second favorite is Samyang Buldak, which I think went viral on Tik-Tok for some reason? But, I eat Buldak when I want to punish my stomach with flavor, and fire. You know, you gotta remind yourself that you’re alive sometimes, and the best way to do that, is to punch your stomach in the stomach with knives known as chili peppers.\n\nMy only downfall is that as I get older, I can’t handle intense spice as much as I used to, but I also partially blame the “one chip challenge” in damaging my stomach (because I’m pretty sure it did).\n\nAnd then, at the top of my list, is Sapporo Ichiban. These noodles aren’t for committing crimes against yourself. It’s got a very rich flavor, it has the MSG, and it’s not punishing to your stomach. Sapporo is for when I’m on a day off from work, and I’m doing for myself a little bit of self care, and I want something easy, and also good to eat. This is my favorite instant noodle of all time.\n\nBut, there is a reason I eat all of this in moderation, and that’s because they’re all absolutely filled to the brim with sodium, and there is definitely value in understanding, that there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nPeople who know me, know that I like to joke about pizza, but, pizza is only my second favorite food. Ramen is number one, and I don’t really speak about it. You wouldn’t know this unless you’ve just read this blog post.\n\nWhich brings me to what made me want to post this, and that is this video posted by someone I know on the fediverse, of multiple professional chefs critiquing instant ramen noodles. I recommend a watch!\n\n   Post by @ManiacalV@mastodon.social View on Mastodon  \n\n\n"

    "content": "So, there’s been a bit of a Kane Pixels drought, ever since Found Footage 3 was released, and if you haven’t watched that yet, you need to. I’m assuming the release of these shorts has been slower, due to the production of the full length feature film that was announced … quite some time ago, at this point. In conjunction with A24, Backrooms, or The Complex, the MOVIE, is set to release … uh, sometime before I die of old age, hopefully! But, until then, we have content to watch from other, smaller-time creators.\n\nI’m very selective with the Backrooms content I’ll watch. The silly, slides-and-coconut-milk (or whatever it is?) backrooms-wiki creations are … we’ll just say, mostly bad. Turning Backrooms into a huge thing that tons of people are adding to without any consideration for what’s being added, really takes the actual fear and immersion completely away from the concept. Which is why I don’t consume that content.\n\nI pretty much only watch Backrooms content that is either Kane Pixels, or works inspired by it.\n\nAnd, even then, sometimes those videos are a little iffy. Sometimes the pacing of the camera-holder versus their footstep movement doesn’t match up well, at all. Sometimes the textures have bad lighting and it’s extremely obvious that they’re just recording in Blender, hence, breaking immersion. Other times, they’ll try to incorporate scenes with actual people in them, or the person who’s lost, themselves, and they’re really not great looking 3D models.\n\nKane is the masterclass, and there are some who follow the formula well.\n\nToday, I discovered TheMrLeoniasty on Youtube, through his Tape 1 video, and it’s really something else. It’s not 100% perfect, some of the pacing is a little off, but it doesn’t try and take the usual formula that most everyone else does (think: howler / bacteria chase scenes that happen in every single video). It, instead, does something entirely different (although, I’m not sure yet how I feel about the PS2 boot screen).\n\nIt’s very slow paced, until the end. The end is absolutely something to behold, as a Backrooms enjoyer.\n\nWatch.\n\n\n"
