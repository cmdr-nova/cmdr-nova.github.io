 Bio:

░ Hi, I go by Ryan, CMDR Nova, and a bunch of other things depending on what I’m currently doing, or working on.

░ I’ve been writing since 2008, making music since 2017, and developing cool stuff in Second Life since 2015.

░ Neofetch of my current personal system:

░ I’m also a webdev and a sysadmin. My website is hosted via Github, and I administer my Mastodon instance via managed hosting at [toot.io](https://toot.io/mastodon_hosting.html){:target="_blank"}.

░ Best-selling artist behind the retrowave/darksynth moniker Eyeshadow 2600 FM, long-time Second Life creator behind the in-world brand [REVOSA], and life-long word cruncher and self published author, currently writing the next two novels in a series of topsy-turvy science fiction, starting with the companion novel to the album, DISSOLUTION PROTOCOL.

> “It’s pumpin’ and thumpin’ time.”

░ IN MUSIC … I’ve been making darksynth, electro, and ambient tunes since, at least, 2017 (although I’ve dabbled all my life). Here are the places where you can hear what I do:

- [Bandcamp](https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com){:target="_blank"}
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/355TNaPlosj1FwN7sfSvAe?si=NGAJSqgsTVKfMbw-HSeDcA){:target="_blank"}
- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/eyeshadow-2600-fm/1210249781){:target="_blank"}

░ And, starting 2024, I’ve begun a new musical venture by the name of PLEXX, a vaporwave, liminal horror experience.

- [Bandcamp](https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux){:target="_blank"}
- [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2jkEsRdWQYWla3H6Ut4Wed?si=6fSDZwCCTnaCCR9uJp6_UA){:target="_blank"}
- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/c-o-m-p-l-e-x-single/1751222634){:target="_blank"}

░ IN SECOND LIFE … I’ve been designing and releasing 3D objects for use with avatars since 2015, as a result of losing my original attempt at the same thing (due to quite a catastrophic romantic breakup). Here’s where you can view what I’m doing now:

- [[REVOSA] Marketplace](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/en-US/stores/165186){:target="_blank"}
- [Ayashi Systems Marketplace](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/en-US/stores/186986){:target="_blank"}
- [In-world Second Life location](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Neo%20Machina/181/171/25){:target="_blank"}

░ IN WRITING … I’ve been, and am currently working on my next book, DISSOLUTION PROTOCOL. A story about the degradation of the entire universe. You can see my other, much older works, [here](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ryan-S.-Fortney/author/B004XWM2X4?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1715877791&sr=8-1&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true){:target="_blank"}. I, of course, also, maintain this website as a place where I can stretch my writing muscles whenever I feel the need.
