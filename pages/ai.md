The topic of AI (Artificial Intelligence) comes up quite a lot these days. The learning models that have been falsely labeled "intelligent," when in reality they're not really all that much more than a social media algorithm that, instead of feeding content, it consumes, and then *also* feeds content. Like a chatbot from the nineties that spits out random words and images that have been fed into it. On this page, I intend to portrary my stance on AI, so that it is fully clear.

**There is almost entirely nothing good about the current idea of what "AI" is, and I fully oppose algorithms that steal from, rip off, and disenfranchise artists, writers, musicians, and tech workers.**

Some people will try to argue that there are just differing views, or that it's a nuanced subject, or someone you know might start sharing AI-generated images but ironically, and you should never take these people seriously. *Every single one of them* is operating in the mindset that all of the other people around them are either in on the scheme, or that everyone else is just unintelligent.

*Do not give this power consuming, planet-destroying, theft-tech any space, whatsoever.*

Those at the top of Silicon Valley say that this tech "democratizes art." Sure, sure it "democratizes" it, by erasing the people who make things, and funneling all of the profit directly into the pockets of the ultra-rich. *Which was the plan the whole time.*
