I've been playing / messing with The Sims since the year 2000, back on a hand-me-down 486, all the way to <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>, on my personal beast of a Linux machine. Being as that The Sims has taken up so much time in my life, why *not* have a page dedicated to it?

So, first thing's first, I have a save file template that I made back in 2020, and you can <a href="/files/save_file.zip" target="_blank">download it here</a>, if you'd like to check it out.

Within this file, you'll find many of my personal sims that I've made over the years, along with *some* of my own buildings, along with a handful from the gallery that I enjoy using (at least, up to 2020).

I also once wrote a "vamphouse" challenge <a href="/gaming/2019/07/28/thesims4-vamphouse-challenge.html">way back in 2019</a>. The link to the Google Drive document that originally detailed the entire challenge no longer works (and I'm not sure which account was hosting it). Fortunately, I managed to find the file where I wrote everything! So, I've restored and preserved it, <a href="/sims4/vamphouse/">here</a>.

<b>A little more about my sims, and a new, expanded world template ...</b>

Back in 2014 or 2015, I started The Sims 4 with a single sim (pictured on the right in the above screenshot), which evolved into a duo (both pictured above) who I've remade and updated in detail almost every single year since. The current shot you can see here is of their 2025 iteration, which I am incorporating into a brand new save file.

You can download the aforementioned up-to-date save file, world template, <a href="/files/sims_template_2025.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.

In this file, you'll find most of the sims I've made over the years, and still use to this day. The sims pictured above, though, are a bit hidden in the mix. The sim pictured on the left, Morgan Karga, lives as a vampire in a renovated trailer with her brother and mother, who are both also vampires.

The sim on the right, who, in this save file, goes by "Merrill Kavanagh," can be found as a child, living with her family in a rather large home.

It's up to you if these two sims ever meet!

<b>More about this new template:</b> 

Some of the default sims in this world have been replaced with the "post purge" version of themselves that I made a few years back after EA updated The Sims 4, causing some kind of bug that rapidly aged almost all sims across a save file. This, in-turn, created a strange, but interesting new handful of "default sims." I kept a lot of them, updating their looks, and gave them new things.

This template is *based* on the template I linked up at the beginning of this page, so it includes the pre-update Goth family, in their original form.

There are some Sims community "easter eggs" contained in this save file. Jim Pickens resides in Brindleton Bay, along with his husband, Grim, and his restaurant, "Slim Pickens."

Urp John (the forearm god) still lives, and in his own place over in San Myshuno. Albeit, he *is* a little older, now.

In some of the very first episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=callmekevin%20sims%204" target="_blank">CallMeKevin's Pickens series</a>, Urp had twins with Jasminder Bheeda, whom were moved into Jim Pickens' first torture-home, where they both promptly died. But, in this universe, Teagan Bheeda lives, married into her own family off in Copperdale (and she's since dyed her hair red).

If you've ever watched <a href="https://youtu.be/2svi_xw_Q7I?si=i6Kuh0m6sDT7j4Im" target="_blank">Buzzfeed Multiplayer and Kelsey's absolutely ridiculous 100 baby challenge</a>, you might recognize one of the families in this template.

<img src="/img/thesims/Screenshot from 2025-01-28 17-55-41.png">

And then there's this household (which definitely isn't the last little inclusion of Sims community content), which I now know only by "Deddenside." I remember I was watching this woman on Twitch create this household, right around the same time the tiny home pack came out, and she made this clown-vampire. It's been so long, I don't remember who she is, and it's made more difficult to identify where this comes from, because the sim in this template is no longer shared by the account I originally got it from.

So, we'll consider this a Sims 4 relic now *only* available in my template.

But there's even more in there! There are sims I've downloaded from people who were friends long ago, and are no longer, some homes I made when I used to stream on Twitch on a semi-regular basis, and default families that are completely different.

Check it out!
