I've been playing / messing with The Sims since the year 2000, back on a hand-me-down 486, all the way to <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>, on my personal beast of a Linux machine. Being as that The Sims has taken up so much time in my life, why *not* have a page dedicated to it?

So, first thing's first, I have a save file template that I made back in 2020, and you can <a href="/files/save_file.zip" target="_blank">download it here</a>, if you'd like to check it out.

Within this file, you'll find many of my personal sims that I've made over the years, along with *some* of my own buildings, along with a handful from the gallery that I enjoy using (at least, up to 2020).

I also once wrote a "vamphouse" challenge <a href="/gaming/2019/07/28/thesims4-vamphouse-challenge.html">way back in 2019</a>. The link to the Google Drive document that originally detailed the entire challenge no longer works (and I'm not sure which account was hosting it). Fortunately, I managed to find the file where I wrote everything! So, I've restored and preserved it, <a href="/sims4/vamphouse/">here</a>.

A little more about my sims ...

Back in 2014 or 2015, I started The Sims 4 with a single sim (pictured on the right in the above screenshot), which evolved into a duo (both pictured above) who I've remade and updated in detail almost every single year since. The current shot you can see here is of their 2025 iteration, which I am incorporating into a brand new save file.

At this point, I have as many save files as I do years I've been alive.

And now, with these updates and changes in mind, you can download my up-to-date world template, <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>. (will be linked once EA fixes their own servers, which they've broken, currently)

In this file, you'll find all of the sims I've made, and still use to this day. The sims pictured above, though, are a bit hidden in the mix. The sim pictured on the left, Morgan Karga, lives as a vampire in a renovated trailer with her brother and mother, who are both also vampires.

The sim on the right, who, in this save file, goes by "Merrill Kavanagh," can be found as a child, living with her family in a rather large home.

It's up to you if these two sims ever meet!
