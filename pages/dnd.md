![a gif of a wizard shooting lightning.](/img/gifs/wizardanime.gif){: .image-left }This is a page for chronicling all of my DND characters (mostly from the videogames, because I've never had the chance to play the tabletop version)

Over the years I've explored the concept of Dungeons and Dragons a few times here and there. I dabbled in Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate as a mid-teen to late-teen. But due to my lack of exposure to roleplaying games as a kid (outside of Diablo), I never really had the chance to delve into it, until now.

So, now, I bring you my characters:

**Arathyra Vos**

[BALDUR'S GATE 1 & 2]

![a photo of my character from Baldur's Gate 1 and 2](/img/dnd/vos.jpg){: .image-right }Arathyra is half-elf bounty hunter, hailing from the fortress of Candlekeep, where she has lived for most of her life. Her favorite passtimes include thieving, trickery, and other clandestine activities. She travels the lands of Faer√ªn alongside a man named John Gun, an eccentric sorcerer. Contrary to his namesake, he does not carry a gun, and therefore also does not care much for the folly of conventional weapons in-general.

**Wistla Park**

[ICEWIND DALE]

![a photo of my character from Icewind Dale](/img/dnd/wistla.jpg){: .image-right }Wistla is a half-elf sorcerer who hails from Easthaven. Not much is yet known of her and her band of misfits, but they were last seen taking care of a pest issue within an inn of sorts.

**Pania Ilphukiir**

[NEVERWINTER NIGHTS]

![a photo of my character from Neverwinter Nights](/img/dnd/pania.jpg){: .image-right }Pania is an elf rogue whose training was abruptly interrupted by an undead plague among the city of Neverwinter. She was last seen flailing wildly at the walking dead, somewhere in the sewers.

**Decaria Nova**

[BALDUR'S GATE 3]

![a photo of my character from Baldur's Gate 3](/img/dnd/decaria.jpg){: .image-right }Decaria is a tiefling paladin, or better yet, an oathbreaker. She travels with a githyanki with whom she shares a bedroll, a previously shadowed heart of a woman, and a volatile sorcerer. They've rid the world of much evil, and were last seen wandering the streets of lower Baldur's Gate.
