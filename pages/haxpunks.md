    In the year 3492, humanity has been reduced to living in a digital landscape of their own making in the farthest reaches of space. Earth is no more, sol is no more. The only thing that remains are the pixel roads of Neo Machina.

            <p>haxPunks are a <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/haxpunks" target="_blank">former NFT project</a>, now freely created and uploaded right here to my website. NFTs were a neat concept, and then the scene was overtaken by scammers and gamblers; people who want to get rich at all costs, no matter who they harm, cheat, or ripoff. Therefore, my little pixel project is no longer an "NFT" project and is simply just something inspired by cryptopunks.</p>
            <p>In the interest of full transparency, I have another couple of projects themed around pixel catgirls named <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/catgirl-pixel-club" target="_blank">catgirl pixel club</a>, and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cpc-ad" target="_blank">catgirl pixel club: after dark</a>, which were originally featured by the official twitter account (pre-musk takeover), and users traded around 30,000 usd worth of ethereum between themselves in order to obtain a part of CPC. I made a fraction of that money, which in-turn helped me buy things that I had needed for the better half of a decade.</p>
            <p>All projects by me, the NFT projects of the past, or the freely available pixel projects of the present, were and are crafted by hand.</p>
