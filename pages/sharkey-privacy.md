<h1>sharkey.mkultra.monster Privacy Policy</h1>
Effective Date: November 27, 2024

This Privacy Policy describes how sharkey.mkultra.monster ("sharkey.mkultra.monster," "we," "us," or "our") collects, and uses your information when you use the Platform.

<b>Information We Collect</b>

When you (the user) create an account on the Platform, you provide an e-mail address (if you decide), a username, and a password. This information is kept in a securely managed and encrypted database, exclusively for the purposes of logging in, and using your account. We do not distribute, scrape, farm, or collect your data for any purposes. Your data will be stored in order to utilize the Platform, until you request that we no longer do so (through account deletion).

<b>ActivityPub and Federated Platforms</b>

Sharkey is an ActivityPub service (a fork of Misskey), which means it connects to other ActivityPub instances across the federated network. When you share content on a Sharkey instance (sharkey.mkutlra.monster, the Platform), it may be visible to users on other ActivityPub instances (Mastodon, GNU Social, Misskey, Sharkey, Pleroma, etc).

You should be aware, that unless dictated through posting mechanisms, content you share may be seen by unintended audiences.

We do not control the privacy practices of other ActivityPub instances. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other ActivityPub instances you visit, along with their rules, and guidelines, and report any concerns to the admin, or moderators.

<b>Your Choices</b>

You can access and update your account information at any time by logging in to your account and visiting your profile settings.

You can choose to delete your account at any time. Once you delete your account, we will delete your information from our systems. However, please note that some information may be retained in our backups for a limited period of time, and that your information will be cached on other ActivityPub services, which are outside of our control.

<b>Security</b>

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no website or internet transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your information. 

<b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. 

<b>Contact Us</b>
