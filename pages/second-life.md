<div class="rainbow"><h1>[REVOSA] x AyaSys</h1></div>

<p><b>[REVOSA]</b> is my long-time standing Second Life store, which was opened in 2015 at the end of something of a tumultuous relationship. Since, it has grown exponentially, and although I've had to make a lot of express space in my time for a daily offline job, it's still running, and <i>still going</i>.</p>

<p><b>AyaSys</b> is a side store that I started back in 2016, under the name Horcrux Solutions, and later (in 2023) changed its name to AyaSys. This store is more geared toward scripts and scripted items, with a dash of decorative props.</p>

<div class="rainbow"><h1>NEO MACHINA</h1></div>

<p>
Neo Machina has had ... kind of a wild journey. It didn't actually <i>begin</i> with me, though, as it was an idea, and a city originally built at the Alter Ego sim, by Second Life resident, Sarrah Docherty. What happened was, is that I took a break from Second Life for a year or so in after 2018, and upon returning, I found that the original Neo Machina <i>was gone</i>, and I was a little upset by this.
</p>

<p>I wanted to keep visiting, and make a home for myself there, you know?</p>

<p>So, I got the wild idea to upgrade my Second Life membership, and rent a Homstead directly from Linden Labs, and rebuild it myself, in my own image. Which I did!</p>

<p>This lasted for about a year and 8 months, until inflation, and debt kind of made it not so fiscally responsible to maintain ... since Linden Labs charges over 100 USD a month in order to maintain a Homestead. And, for about two months, Neo Machina was completely gone (although, I tried a few different ways in order to resurrect it).</p>

<p>But then, I got another wild idea. In order to avoid paying land barons, and in order to keep costs down, I decided to go and buy a ton of Mainland space for myself, and then rebuild Neo Machina <i>that way</i></p>

<p>And then, voila, my city returned! Neo Machina now stands at Auriga, directly next to protected roadways.</p>

<p>You can visit Neo Machina, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/150/185/68" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
