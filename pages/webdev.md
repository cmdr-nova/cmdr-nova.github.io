I do a lot of talking about how and *why* you should build a website. How short-form social media, *even ActivityPub*, can be less reliable for containing your words, ideas, and body of work. And that, with this in mind, you absolutely should build a website that can be a *central* place for everything that is you.

Something that you can keep, store on a hdd, an ssd, a thumb drive, or all of these things at once. So that *no matter what happens*, you lose nothing.

I've seen people compare owning or building a website to the act of buying and owning a home (which is, by far, an unrealistic and sort of strange comparison). Putting up a website, once you've got the basics down, is as easy as copying a file from your downloads directory to your desktop.

So, I decided I wanted to write a guide on how to get started with your own website!
