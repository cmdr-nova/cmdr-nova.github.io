I do a lot of talking about how and *why* you should build a website. How short-form social media, *even ActivityPub*, can be less reliable for containing your words, ideas, and body of work. And that, with this in mind, you absolutely should build a website that can be a *central* place for everything that is you.

Something that you can keep, store on a hdd, an ssd, a thumb drive, or all of these things at once. So that *no matter what happens*, you lose nothing.

I've seen people compare owning or building a website to the act of buying and owning a home (which is, by far, an unrealistic and sort of strange comparison). Putting up a website, once you've got the basics down, is as easy as copying a file from your downloads directory to your desktop.

So, I decided I wanted to write a guide on how to get started with your own website!

***USEFUL RESOURCES***

You don't have to build your website alone, there are tools you can use, and places you can visit for web crafting material and more!

**TOOLS**

For writing, as mentioned in the guide, you can use notepad (or some-such text editor) to build your site, but if you want to feel like a real webdev, you can use these apps, as well:

> > > <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VS CODE</a>

VS Code is *really* useful. With content-aware code highlighting, and autocomplete to help you out along the way, and *even* the ability to connect to Github (if you decide to use Github Pages, or Deploy-to-Neocities), this is really the most *complete* app.

> > > <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>

Obsidian is like Apple Notes, but on steroids, and it has code highlighting! Notes are markdown files by default, so this is *especially* useful if you decide to use something like Jekyll to maintain a combination website and blog (for more advanced users).

You can also use Obsidian to create and host a website, but this isn't something I've explored (because you have to pay for it, and I already pay for Obsidian).

**WEBSITES**

> > > <a href="https://forum.melonland.net/" target="_blank">melonland forums</a>

I've linked to this website / forum before, but it *really is* useful. You can find ideas, cool retro elements to use on your site, and most importantly, an entire community to help you along your way.
