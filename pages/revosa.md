***As of August 16th, 2024, [REVOSA] was shuttered in order to remain on the Second Life marketplace page, only, and on August 31st, 2024, Neo Machina was taken offline, in order to save money and re-adjust priorities. The below text will remain the way it is as a piece of history that chronicles the efforts I made in building and creating, in Second Life.***

Since 2015, I've been running a virtual store in the virtual world, [Second Life](https://secondlife.com/){:target="_blank"}. This thing started as sort of a "Oh yeah? Well I don't *need* you, anyway!" sorta deal. In that, I was virtually dating a woman, and we were running a car customization and parts store together. After about half a year, she ... out of the blue, decided she liked someone new. And then she took all of our work, called it her own, and ditched me.

Enter: [[REVOSA]](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/en-US/stores/165186){:target="_blank"}

A little tiny store that began on a small parcel in the middle of nowhere, mostly selling hand-crafted car parts that I'd made in Blender. I think I had one or two entire visitors the whole time I was there, until I eventually decided that car parts weren't really the only thing I wanted to make. Settling on the idea of making home-props and avatar accessories, I packed my things a few weeks later and moved to a more suitable parcel on Chung-owned land.

The beginnings of this store were also happening at a difficult time in my life. I'd just left my job due to a myriad of reasons, and had developed an anxiety disorder so severe that going *outside*, at all, resulted in my entire body freezing in place. Especially when faced with going places populated by mass amounts of people, such as department stores, and big box stores. It was so bad, that I would only go out at night, and only while wearing a hoodie that I could hide myself in. And *only* to a gas station to get an energy drink and some smokes. Funded, almost entirely by money I made in my previous job, and that of which I gathered from sales in Second Life.

The store increased in size exponentially as I worked through 2016 and into 2017, where I then also began my music venture, under the stage-name, *Eyeshadow 2600 FM* (but this is part of a different story).

There are *some* products that I made in this era of my store, that are *still* waiting for an update and expansion upon, here, and now, in 2024. I would start projects, put out a few pieces of what I had planned, and then abandon them and start on an entirely new project. In the timeframe of 2016 to the end of 2017, [REVOSA] expanded to around 200 products, and had regular visitors on a day-to-day basis. I even had people coming in requesting custom tattoos, custom mesh design, and so on and so forth (but I never really delved all that much into doing custom material, because people can be finicky, and it wasted a lot of my time).

As we came into 2018 and through 2019, the store moved *again*. Still utilizing Chung-owned land, but this time in a skybox off the main road, and more uniform. I started working with mesh templates for bodies, gathered ideas for clothing, and even *made* a few things. Of course, I also dabbled in simply *buying* template clothes from stores that I could texture, just to see if that was something people would be interested in. It should be noted that, for whatever reason, some people oppose creators who buy mesh clothing that's already animated and rigged and ready-to-go. But those people have never tried rigging clothing to the Second Life skeleton and spent 3 straight days screaming in agony as it fails over, and over again.

Plus, "AI" is a much bigger problem in Second Life, than creators supporting creators, and getting things done in a fraction of the time.

When 2020 came around, this is around the time I got *heavily* into my music. So much so, that [REVOSA] took a major back-seat. The store, from this point forward would go into a sort of maintenance mode, where I would update things, maybe put out a product here and there, and then let it sit. This went on ... unfortunately, for *years*. Part of this, is because I eventually overcame my issues with anxiety, fixed myself up, put myself back together, and re-entered the workforce near the end of 2020.

It was around this time my Second Life store really began its vacation from having *anything* done with it. But, despite a hiatus, from 2015 and onward, it would garner around 20-30 USD in Linden Dollars, every month, without pause.

Then 2023 came around. It was another day after work, doing some maintenance to my store, and feeling like, you know, "Hey. I have a job now. I'm making money. What if I bought a sim?"

Enter: Neo Machina

Years, and years back, I was a big fan of a scifi/cyberpunk sim (server, in Second Life words) named Neo Machina. It was basically new tokyo, but 2077. I had a small off-shoot of my store there, and would mingle with the residents on a daily basis. But ... after taking a shorter type of break in 2018, and returning, I'd found that Neo Machina had vanished completely. Its creators seeking new ideas, new venues, and new *things*, in-general.

Then came the idea of buying a Homestead. Not quite as resource-heavy as a full sim, but enough to build something. And quite a bit cheaper, as well.

It was my thought that, "Hey, these people don't seem all that interested in keeping Neo Machina going, so I'll make a new version, in my own way!" And that I did. Welcome to post-apocalyptic Neo Machina, in the year 3285. Through this city, I built places for people to rent and call home. I built *my own* home, and then I moved my store to the top corner of the city. *Finally.* I don't have to pay the Chungs rent anymore.

And now we're here at 2024, sort of in hiatus mode again as I work on a slew of other things I've got going, but very much still active in the virtual world.

You can visit the city, or [REVOSA] at any time, everything I made is *still* there, and I do still gradually add new products. I imagine that soon, maybe come fall, I'll probably get back into my obsession of maintaining all of this, and release about 40 new products. Who knows! That's usually how it works, with me, *at least*.

Where we go from here? We'll see ...
