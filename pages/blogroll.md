*This page is to be expanded upon as I surf the indieweb on the World Wide Internet*

- [Shellsharks](https://shellsharks.com){:target="_blank"} // A cool user on Mastodon whom I speak to here and there. Has also helped me with some of the features and code on this website, including with being inspired to ditch Wordpress and dive into Jekyll.

- [Furnation](https://furnationreborn.com/){:target="_blank"} // What I'm considering probably the oldest furry webring on the internet, currently. Maintained and brought back to life by Logan, someone I met through Second Life who is also currently hosting my store. Not *really* a blog, but definitely worth a mention. Here lies pieces of the nineties, forever preserved.

- [Blau's Blog](https://blaurascon.nfshost.com){:target="_blank"} // Blau, who I met via Mastodon, who helped me transition from Second Life to VR Chat, and introduced me to a handful of groups and communities.
