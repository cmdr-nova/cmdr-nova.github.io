# # 7/27/24

- today I took all the time I needed and added content pages for *ever single link* that I had staged yesterday. Due to the fact that this is about 15 or so pages, I feel no need to list them all individually. But you *will* find that Nova Prime has zero dead links.

# # 7/26/24

- added empty links as placeholders for future content
- moved content pages into their own subfolder in order to keep things a little more organized
- added a few more flavor images to the main page so that it's not all just black text and white space
- added flavor text to the top of the main page in order to add some personality
- added a superfluous copyright declaration to the bottom of the page
- added content to the following pages
  * AI, Why, Defaults
- put a few background images into the img folder for possible future use, but wasn't entirely feeling their presence on the page just yet
