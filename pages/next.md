- My next novel, that has been in-the-works for about a year and a half, with a bit of a hiatus due to my offline job
    * DISSOLUTION PROTOCOL, *a story revolving around the destruction of space and time, and the entire universe, due to failed system checks prior to launching vessels into the void that break the laws of physics.* **Think: The Titan Sub incident, but on a galactic, unvirse-wide scale.**


- An on-going series of "Did you know ..." shorts on [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@cmdr_nova){:target="_blank"}, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cmdr_nova){:target="_blank"}, and [Youtube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmEkfR480A4kdNJyuP5ny4Q){:target="_blank"}, detailing either real facts, or fictional, made-up scenarios.
