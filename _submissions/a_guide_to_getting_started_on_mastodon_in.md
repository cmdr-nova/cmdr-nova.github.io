<p><div class="md">
<p>A lot of the times, I see people on other sites, like Bluesky, and Threads (even though I now no longer use Threads), saying some pretty wild things about the experience of signing up and getting started with Mastodon. Some of it is really confusing, or bewildering, because I just don't understand where they're coming from with a lot of their criticism (it's too hard, you gotta set things up before you can post).</p> <p>In reponse, and because there's likely yet another influx coming from Threads, Instagram, and maybe even Facebook, I used a new page on my website to write a bit of a "getting started" guide for people unfamiliar with Mastodon.</p> <p><a href="https://nova.mkultra.monster/pages/feditips/" target="_blank">https://nova.mkultra.monster/pages/feditips/</a></p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/" target="_blank"> r/Mastodon </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/1hwxylu/a_guide_to_getting_started_on_mastodon_in/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/1hwxylu/a_guide_to_getting_started_on_mastodon_in/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
