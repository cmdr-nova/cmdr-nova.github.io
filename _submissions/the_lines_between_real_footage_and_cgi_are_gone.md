<p>I've been scrolling through this subreddit reading people's reactions to Found Footage #3, and I have to say it absolutely blows all other Backrooms content out of the water. Even, in some light, Kane blew his own work out of the water, too. In the very beginning (with his original short film that apparently starred himself in the Backrooms), you could definitely tell where the actual recorded footage stops and the Blender (I'm not sure what else he's using) footage began.</p> <p>Not so much in FF3. In fact, I was waiting for a surprise protagonist hand to appear while he was within the Backrooms. It looked that real, that I legitimately believed Kane and crew built the entire set themselves. Which, would be a really neat possibility to see in the future.</p> <p>I don't know about anyone else, but in Backrooms content by other channels, the extremely fake looking people these random Youtubers use are completely immersion breaking, and I wish they wouldn't do it unless they could make it convincing.</p> <p>But I wanted to remark about how unbelievably real everything looks in FF3, and I definitely hold it up as the benchmark for all other Backrooms content.</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KanePixelsBackrooms/" target="_blank"> r/KanePixelsBackrooms </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KanePixelsBackrooms/comments/1fhl1hy/the_lines_between_real_footage_and_cgi_are_gone/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KanePixelsBackrooms/comments/1fhl1hy/the_lines_between_real_footage_and_cgi_are_gone/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
