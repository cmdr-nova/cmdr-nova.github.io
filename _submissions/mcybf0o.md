<p>This is the one catch that stops most people. A lot of countries require you to be financially comfortable, and comfortable enough that you won’t suddenly become financially stressed. Some counties even require a degree, and while I know a lot of people have gone to school, a lot have also not done so.</p> <p>So, either the lot of us kind of just stick it out to see what happens, or wait until you can claim refugee status</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p>
