<p><div class="md">
<p>Hey guys, recently started using pop_os on a new system76 machine and mostly everything works great, right out of the box, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why the mic on my Steelseries Arctis 5 headset won't pick up anything. The headset itself works fine, I can hear everything, but there's just no voice pickup at all (even though I can select it in the settings?)</p> <p>I've tried searching for solutions, but a lot of what I find on Google is mostly related to something called Pusleaudio, and I honestly have no idea what that is lol</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/" target="_blank"> r/pop_os </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/1bob5ie/arctis_5_headset_no_mic_functionality/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/1bob5ie/arctis_5_headset_no_mic_functionality/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
