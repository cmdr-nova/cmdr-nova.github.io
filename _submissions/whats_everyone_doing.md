<p><div class="md">
<p>I wanna preface this with: I actively watch online users through a script I made (caues it's interesting to me), and this hasn't really changed all that much in a long time. It fluctuates between 30,000 to 50,000 users. That may not sound like a lot, but it's <em>more</em> than the amount of players EVE Online has had concurrently for the past <em>decade</em>.</p> <p>And, I know there are a lot of people who kind of just ... shop, and there are a lot of people in these medieval fantasy RP sims, but where's everyone else? Where are my cyberpunk/scifi/space lovers? Where are the sims dedicated to these things?</p> <p>I spend a lot of time in my own home with ban-lines up (vampires, it's always because of vampires), and it's <em>sort</em> of easy to meet people through the Thundr app, but even on that app, a lot of people are kinda ... meh. And I'm talking like, "I don't check this app, message me on Instagram" (for real? this is Second Life, I don't care about your insta), or "Looking for someone to entertain me"</p> <p>I feel like, over the past 13 years, the demographic has changed a little, and I don't have a lot in common with a good portion of users in SL anymore.</p> <p>You got the oldies, who have their entire private sims where they live out their family fantasies or whatever, and then you've got the very young people who are now coming in acting like it's VR Chat. And by that, I mean, people who say they won't talk to you unless you voice 100% of the time (voicing is exhausting, I'm an introvert).</p> <p>So what's everyone doing, where does everyone go anymore? Tell me we're not all just AFKing at EXHALE</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/secondlife/" target="_blank"> r/secondlife </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/secondlife/comments/1hccnak/whats_everyone_doing/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/secondlife/comments/1hccnak/whats_everyone_doing/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
