<p><div class="md">
<p>I've marked this as a spoiler because it has to do with a side-quest, and I don't want to risk spoiling anything for someone, so. I wanted to tell my story here as to what happened, because god dang, man?</p> <p>Firstly, I started off investigating a murder, and so on and so forth. I got past all of that. I was traveling on the road automatically, and got stopped by a pack of wolves and some guys who were fighting them. For ... whatever reason, the wolves chased off the two guys who were there, and I was left standing alone with those guy's horse. So I stole it.</p> <p>Somehow, I've managed to keep this horse with me as I travel between towns. I don't even know if I can eventually own it, but I do know that nobody seems to realize that I've stolen it.</p> <p>Never-the-less, that's not the mistake I made.</p> <p>I met two guys who wanted a lute, and they mentioned that another guy in a house had one (I forget the name, which is pretty wild considering all things). I agreed to take on their request, and figured I would just steal the thing. You know, I have a lot of experience stealing things. I played Skyrim for 10 years.</p> <p>So anyway, I jump on my stolen horse and ride back to the other town, and there's the house. There are some people working outside, and if you peak in the window, you can see the owner nodding off in a chair, and his lute hanging on the wall. Perfect, I think. I'll just sneak in and take it while he sleeps.</p> <p>That's what I thought.</p> <p>I open the door and walk in, and then start sneaking. With the door closed behind me, I sneak into the other room, and the guy wakes up, immediately notices someone's in his house. I panic. I run through the opposite door and up some stairs, he's looking for me. I'm not sure if he's noticed who it is, or not, but he was getting closer.</p> <p>So I did what any rational person would do ...</p> <p>I drew my sword and killed him. Left his body right there on the second floor of his own home, stole a bunch of his clothing to replace my blood-stained armor, walked out of his house like nothing happened, jumped on my horse, and road off to become a blacksmith, where I would dump my stolen clothing and also bloodied clothing in my new bed-chest at my new job.</p> <p>How fucked am I?</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/" target="_blank"> r/kingdomcome </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1iz9nzz/kcd2_i_made_a_mistake_and_someone_died_for_it/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1iz9nzz/kcd2_i_made_a_mistake_and_someone_died_for_it/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
