<p><div class="md">
<p>And as I turned the corner, I saw something on the road. I looked over and it was a dead cat. Someone ran over a stray, or a wild adult cat, and it pisses me off. Pisses me off that the person didn’t stop their car and put on their hazards, or at least swerve. Pisses me off that a thinking, feeling being is just struck dead and left on the road. Pisses me off that a lot of people see the lives of nonhumans as inconsequential to their own.</p> <p>That cat didn’t deserve to die, and whoever drove over the animal should’ve stopped. You should’ve done something.</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/" target="_blank"> r/Vent </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gcq6pv/i_was_driving_to_work/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1gcq6pv/i_was_driving_to_work/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
