<p><div class="md">
<p>Has anyone found an app that is actually alright or even really good?</p> <p>I’m on Tinder, I call it swipeageddon cause that’s all you’ll ever do. Someone said Hinge is great but I’m going to be candid, the app is almost entirely trying to match me with people I am 100% not attracted to at all. OKCupid, I almost got a date on this one, this past month, but it fizzled out after 24 hours. </p> <p>Bumble is also pretty crap. The gist of the app is a neat idea, but it ends up exactly the same as the rest of them, and with fewer daily swipes. Plenty of Fish is heavily monetized to the point of being useless. Zoosk is a ghost town, and Facebook dating is a dating app to meet scammers who want you to invest in their crypto cloud mining scheme.</p> <p>I think I’ve covered all the apps people actually use, and it sucks because I remember 10 years ago when this was all much easier.</p> </div></p><p></p><p><!-- SC_ON --></p><p>submitted by</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cmdr_nova69" target="_blank"> /u/cmdr_nova69 </a></p><p>to</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/" target="_blank"> r/DatingApps </a></p><p></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/142uamg/no_actual_good_dating_apps/" target="_blank">[link]</a></span></p><p></p><p><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/142uamg/no_actual_good_dating_apps/" target="_blank">[comments]</a></span></p>
