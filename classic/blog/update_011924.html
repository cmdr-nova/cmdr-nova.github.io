  <h1>A transition of sorts</h1>
  <p><b>Update 01.19.24</b></p>
  <p align="right">author: cmdr_nova</p>
  <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 21px; text-indent: 30px;">So, for quite a while, or some time, I've been writing my blog updates on Tumblr. Heck, I even went and bought my Tumblr a cheap 5 dollar domain, because I was convinced this was the best idea at the time. To somehow connect my little static webpage to a live Tumblr blog that people follow and react to. But, as neat as Tumblr is, it's not <i>really</i> a blogging website. It's more a place for memes, and fanfics, and fandom. And that's what it's always been about. And that's okay.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 21px; text-indent: 30px;">What I need is as place to just write, and whether a million people are following this page, or this website on Github (where it's hosted) doesn't matter. What matters is that what I'm writing and posting is going onto my own website, and is backed up in multiple places. If GitHub pulls the plug, I still have my website ready to deploy somewhere else, easy peasy. If Tumblr pulls the plug, oh shoot, there goes all of my ceaseless thought streaming in long-form format.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 21px; text-indent: 30px;">Social media in-general is in mega turmoil, and I feel it's best to get everything you do, or <i>want</i> to do in a place where the Elon Musks of the world can't delete all of it on a whim. And in an age where companies like Ubisoft are asking you to get comfortable with not owning anything: It's doubly important to own your shit.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 21px; text-indent: 30px;">Welcome to me, in 2024. And, if you weren't aware, or haven't stumbled into it yet, I now run a <a href="https://nova.masto.host/about" target="_blank">small mastodon instance</a> currently fit for around 20 users. This <i>may</i> increase over time, but in order to join (for now) you'll need to sign up on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">my Patreon</a> for at least a dollar, and then request access. I do this both to control who signs up (in order to filter out bad actors), and to help fund possible expansion in the future. Not all Mastodon instances are run like this, but as someone funding something like this out of my own pockets, I feel it is the most logical.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 21px; text-indent: 30px;">But that's all for now! Live long and prosper, choom.</p>
