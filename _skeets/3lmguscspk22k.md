For 5 years I was legit only making music (and some other art stuff), while I was at home, isolated, suffering trauma, etc, etc, and for those 5 years I had to endure rich dudes saying things like “art/music is a hobby, it shouldn’t be for money”

And I still vehemently hate when ppl talk like this
