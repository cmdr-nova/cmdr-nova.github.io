<h2>websites:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="/" target="_blank">NOVA PRIME</a> : my personal website, a blog filled with hours, weeks, & months of written text, in the style of a purposely de-modernized theme with a slight mixture of actual modern code (think, if geocities met css & javascript).</p>

<p>the current iteration of nova prime was developed by deploying a build of jekyll's minima theme (via ruby) as a static site, and then i systematically dismantled it until it was my own site. see the <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/cmdr-nova.github.io/tree/master" target="_blank">github repository</a> for a look into the chaos.</p>

<p>░ <a href="/classic" target="_blank">NOVA PRIME (OLD VERSION)</a> : the old version of my website that came before what this portfolio is attached to. basically the same thing, but a bit more rough and brightly colored.</p>

<p>this version of nova prime as hand-written via many, <i>many</i>, pieces of frankensteined code.</p>

<p>░ <a href="/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">LINKGARDEN</a> : i recognized the need to have a landing page where people could immediately see my most important links, content i'm working on, and where to find me--without an entire website of novels-worth of text in their way. and then this gave me an idea: hey, self, this is something a lot of people use, and <i>also</i>, a lot of them are paying some service on a monthly basis to have something that's relatively simple to code, and display. therein, linkgarden was born.</p>

<p>░  <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank">MKULTRA MONSTER</a> : the mastodon instance on the activitypub federated network that i run, admin, and design (via css).</p>

<h2>music:</h2>

<h2>apps:</h2>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/reddit_bot" target="_blank">REDDIT BOT</a> : a python script that picks from a list of subreddits and looks through the top 50 trending posts (image posts only), and then posts just one, at random, to an automated mastodon account. also best used as a cronjob for continual posts, but can absolutely be used to post whenever you want with one command.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/blog-poster" target="_blank">BLOG POSTER</a> : a python script that reads your RSS feed, and posts new items it finds to both mastodon and a discord channel, and upon first run, adds all current items to a json in order to avoid spamming and posting old content.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/chatter-bot" target="_blank">CHATTER BOT</a> : a python script that posts random defined status messages to mastodon, and also replies to mentions with random predefined statuses.</p>
