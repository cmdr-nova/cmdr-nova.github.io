<h2>websites:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="/">NOVA PRIME</a> : my personal website, a blog filled with hours, weeks, & months of written text, in the style of a purposely de-modernized theme with a slight mixture of actual modern code (think, if geocities met css & javascript).</p>

<p>the current iteration of nova prime was developed by deploying a build of jekyll's minima theme (via ruby) as a static site, and then i systematically dismantled it until it was my own site. see the <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/cmdr-nova.github.io/tree/master" target="_blank">github repository</a> for a look into the chaos.</p>

<p>░ <a href="/classic">NOVA PRIME (OLD VERSION)</a> : the old version of my website that came before what this portfolio is attached to. basically the same thing, but a bit more rough and brightly colored.</p>

<p>this version of nova prime as hand-written via many, <i>many</i>, pieces of frankensteined code.</p>

<p>░ <a href="/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">LINKGARDEN</a> : i recognized the need to have a landing page where people could immediately see my most important links, content i'm working on, and where to find me--without an entire website of novels-worth of text in their way. and then this gave me an idea: hey, self, this is something a lot of people use, and <i>also</i>, a lot of them are paying some service on a monthly basis to have something that's relatively simple to code, and display. therein, linkgarden was born.</p>

<h2>music:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">EYESHADOW 2600 FM</a> : a body of work created from the years of 2017 to 2023, from experimental garbage-electronic, to full-on darksynth, electro, & ambient.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">PLEXX</a> : my latest venture into continuing most of the same trends, with a dash of nineties liminal horror.</p>

<h2>3d design:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/en-US/stores/165186" target="_blank">[REVOSA]</a> & <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/en-US/stores/186986" target="_blank">Ayashi Systems</a> : from 2015, & to the present, i have practiced, exercised, & executed skills in graphic & 3d design in order to build & maintain multiple virtual stores within the world of second life.</p>
