<p>I wanna see a Star Trek show where a research vessel is studying a supermassive black hole and a miscalculation causes them to become trapped inside, and the duration of the show is them dealing with strange anomalies that occur in a void where time isn’t real, until the final season where they pass through the singularity to the farthest reaches of the universe and known space</p>
