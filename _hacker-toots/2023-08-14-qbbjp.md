<p>So far  I&#39;ve found little consequence to simply ... siding with the goblins and their Drow leader lol</p><p>My party isn&#39;t even upset that I&#39;m going to lead them directly into the Grove</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to help her kill everything there but I did need the fortress emptied</p>
