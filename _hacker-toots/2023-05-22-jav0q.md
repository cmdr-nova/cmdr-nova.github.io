<p>Maybe I wasn&#39;t meant to hook up with this person I met on OKC, maybe she connected with me to tell me it&#39;s okay to like things that people think is nerd shit and I don&#39;t have to date someone who thinks what I like is nerd shit just because I&#39;m getting older and time has passed since I&#39;ve been 19</p>
