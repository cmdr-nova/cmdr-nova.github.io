<p>@alex_02@infosec.exchange I&#39;ve been clinging on because of all the stuff i do, but for the most part I think I&#39;m lying to myself that it&#39;s even worth it, cause my engagement has gone done dramatically in the past couple months and I think a lot of the clicks on my work come from here</p>
