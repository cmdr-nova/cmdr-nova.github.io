<p>You know, eventually, and I&#39;m not going to see it happen, but eventually people are going to talk about the nature of space and planets the same way they do grass and trees. It&#39;ll be normal and there won&#39;t be any wonder about it. Jupiter will just be a gas giant, and you&#39;ll fly out there and look at it and go, ah well you know, once you&#39;ve seen one ball of fart, you&#39;ve seen them all</p>
