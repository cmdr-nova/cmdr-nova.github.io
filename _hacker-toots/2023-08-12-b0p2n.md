<p>I&#39;m a little afraid of actually putting a foot forward and releasing a fresh and clean brand new single, because I don&#39;t have the community backing I had during Polybius and Ride Eternal</p><p>Of course &quot;eternal&quot; is already &quot;out&quot; on the preorder, but it&#39;s not listenable on Spotify and Apple, and it will be after tonight</p><p>Wonder what&#39;ll happen</p>
