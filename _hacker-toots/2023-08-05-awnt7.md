<p>longterm investigation of the other social networks</p><p>threads still just influencers talking like they&#39;re demigods and bluesky only slightly more tolerable, but only because i can have my website as a username domain</p><p>that is to say people are more genuine on bluesky, and it&#39;s kind of opened my eyes to why mastodon will always be some sort of niche and it&#39;s because a lot of people just want to make an account and not think about it for the rest of eternity</p>
