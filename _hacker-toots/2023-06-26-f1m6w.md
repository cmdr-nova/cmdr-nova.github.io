<p>@alex_02@infosec.exchange Yeah, that&#39;s another thing I noticed. Even in this semi pretty powerful Inspiron, the battery really only gives me like 2 hours of uptime, and that&#39;s if I&#39;m only using it to do online tasks. It&#39;s worse if I turn on Blender or FL Studio, which is mainly what I want to use a Windows machine for (because there are just some things I like doing more on Windows than Mac)</p>
