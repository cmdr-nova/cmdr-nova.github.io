<p>want to use some time today to make a new track for this album so that i don&#39;t feel like i&#39;m constantly falling behind on getting this album done</p><p>but i think one of the reasons i&#39;m having a hard time, is that i want to make a lot of ambient space-y tracks, and that&#39;s not what i feel like people want out of the next album lol</p>
