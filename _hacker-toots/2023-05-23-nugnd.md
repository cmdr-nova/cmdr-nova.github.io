<p>The downside of being an active creator in <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/secondlife" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>secondlife</span></a> is that you get event &quot;invites&quot; from scammers who rent out a server for a month and then scam store owners into paying high rent prices to set up a stall</p>
