<p>I&#39;m about a quarter of the way done paying off this Inspiron 14 Plus and when it&#39;s done Dell will probably increase my allowed credit and maybe I should use it to replace the Inspiron with a high end workstation laptop</p><p>But I still can&#39;t wrap my head around why a 1300 dollar Windows laptop with a 16 core processor and a total of 16 gigs of shared memory is less powerful than a Macbook with basically the same stats, mainly just because of Intel&#39;s Iris XE hardware</p>
