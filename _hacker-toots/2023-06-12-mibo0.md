<p>My dept at work is in a constant state of chaos cause they approved a transfer out without a replacement, then my only associate is on multiple vacations this month in the midst of training a brand new employee, and then the one who’s on vacation wants to transfer out in 2 weeks as we (maybe) find a replacement for him</p><p>My hair will be gray by July</p>
