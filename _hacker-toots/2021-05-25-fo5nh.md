<p>the wildest thing about data farming is like</p><p>google, facebook, twitter, these companies are farming everything about you, they know you. from your search results to your real world conversations. if you have a smart device with a mic, it is actually listening to you</p><p>these corporations could tell you who you&#39;re having an affair with, and how long your fingernails are, and all that information isn&#39;t being used to help anyone, it isn&#39;t being used to catch criminals</p><p>it&#39;s being used to sell you shit</p><p>today facebook served me an ad that is word for word one of my random google searches and i&#39;m so numb to it i don&#39;t even care anymore</p>
