<p>I have a surround of facade buildings on my sim in Second Life, takes up 12 land impact (impact, as in, memory used on a server) out of 3000</p><p>But whenever I go shopping for more or new ones, people always trying to drop 70-100 land impact facade buildings on you by displaying them in-world at a size smaller than an avatar in order to give the illusion that they&#39;re more like 10 land impact (size affects impact)</p><p>Store owners on Mastodon who may be lurking from Second Life: Be honest with your customers</p>
