<p>Just remembered that a week ago I accidentally undeleted my Twitter, and I&#39;m looking at it now, people posting engagement grifts with negative topics/baiting for &quot;unpopular opinions&quot;</p><p>The website really is a downer zone. I have accounts connected to it, some I can&#39;t even remember at this point. There&#39;s no reason to post there anymore because it&#39;s mostly abandoned and the only people still tweeting are just mutuals holding each other hostage</p><p>Re-delete?</p>
