<p>Hey guys, it&#39;s <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/FollowFriday" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>FollowFriday</span></a> so let me introduce myself to people who may not know me and may see me scroll by on the fedi from time to time.</p><p>I primarily use this website to post things, and randomly dabble in the others in an attempt to see which of the new websites out-engagement each otherðŸ˜‚â€‹</p><p>But first and foremost, I am an artist. I have a 20 or 21 album back catalogue on Bandcamp, exactly 1 of which was a bestseller in 2020</p><p>I also make things in Second Life for fun and side-cash, and I&#39;m writing a space opera about the problem with technology and human ambition without checks and safeties (sound familiar?)</p><p>Follow me and I&#39;ll toss you a followback</p>
