<p>I&#39;m still coming to terms with where my gender sits, and I think I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m just &quot;back in the closet&quot;</p><p>Because when I think of myself as a  she I don&#39;t feel repulsed, just that I feel like I&#39;m not allowed to say that anymore, which means I am 100% just back to being a closeted trans woman</p><p>And it&#39;s wild to see, that as soon as I make that discovery on another social media website, aggressive dipshits are jumping at the chance to call me a &#39;they&#39;</p>
