<p>Someone on /r/outfits kicked me out of the subreddit after I commented “nice” on an outfit, reason being they seemed to think I was a catfish account (probably noticed that I’m trans but currently not transitioning because of many reasons). </p><p>Told em to go fuck themselves and got banned from Reddit for 3 days haha</p>
