<p>These topics drive me especially mad, because early at the beginning of last year, I started drawing NFTs, and I have to emphasize that I did this by hand, because a lot of the &quot;projects&quot; out there are auto-generated from crafted traits</p><p>But whatever, it makes me angry, because when I started doing that, I lost A LOT of friends. I made some extra spending money for myself, and bought things I&#39;ve needed for SEVEN years. But I, again, lost many friends. Had people on birdsite and mastodon make snide remarks to or about me, and I was mainly just having fun creating something different, even if it was a blockchain.</p><p>Fast forward a year, and now AI is a ~thing~ and it&#39;s scraping and stealing art and everything in-between from artists and SO MANY PEOPLE don&#39;t give any shits at all. So much so that it&#39;s driving me crazy. </p><p>You mean to tell me I lost friends for actually doing artistic work, but I could generate a bunch of stolen art and nobody would say A WORD?!</p><p>From this point forward I don&#39;t give a flying fuck what anyone thinks about what I do</p>
