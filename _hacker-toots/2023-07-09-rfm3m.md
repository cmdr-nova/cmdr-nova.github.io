<p>@alex_02@infosec.exchange well, a lot of the modules, the most popular one being midjourney, just use everything it can possibly scrape, and even if someone can&#39;t legally make money off of whatever it generates, it&#39;s still bad, the artist should be compensated, and I absolutely have seen people being asked to be paid for generating &quot;art&quot; with prompts</p>
