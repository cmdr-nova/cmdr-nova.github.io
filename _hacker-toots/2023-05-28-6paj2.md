<p>I have a pretty old (at this point) laptop on the ground that has linux on it (debian I think), and the laptop&#39;s keyboard doesn&#39;t work at all. Think I installed it as a way to remotely host a mastodon instance (and probably failed)</p><p>Wonder if I could do anything with it. not even sure what its specs are but they aren&#39;t pretty</p>
