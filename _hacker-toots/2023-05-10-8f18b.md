<p>Guess I made a friend mad in Second Life</p><p>She wanted to help me build a new version of my store, but in order to do so she wanted access to edit everything I&#39;ve built (which would also let her take or delete things)</p><p>I vowed to myself that I would never trust anyone to have that kind of power of me ever again</p>
