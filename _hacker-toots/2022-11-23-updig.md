<p>I feel like there should be a program for generation z, because I&#39;ve noticed _a lot_ these people grew up or are growing up with smartphones and tablets, and learning nothing of computing and security</p><p>In a day and age where it&#39;s normal to put all of your information out there, down to critical details, coming from a childhood where I was reprimanded for sending an email to someone in London ðŸ˜‚â€‹</p><p>But for real, too many people don&#39;t know how to protect themselves online, don&#39;t know how to use a computer, nor do they know how they work, and that should change</p>
