<p>@CosmicTrigger@kolektiva.social I feel like part of that sadist mindset, is that if suddenly we didn’t have to suffer in order to live, and let’s face it … most jobs are just creating suffering. But if we suddenly didn’t need to do all that, the boomers who did would have to come to terms with spending their whole lives suffering, and they don’t get to spend their youth not suffering, because their time is up. And I think that must be pretty scary, and sad</p>
