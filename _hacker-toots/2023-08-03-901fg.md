<p>I&#39;m talking with people in Second Life irt a vampire system where I joined on one avatar, and then remembered I had joined on another avatar years ago, and expressed that this is because my memory is just that bad, and one of them doesn&#39;t really believe me.</p><p>I&#39;ve been through so much stress, anxiety and different types of trauma that yes, my memory is riddled with holes and it still doesn&#39;t work right</p><p>Don&#39;t know what to tell ya</p>
