<p>One of my fave stores in <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/secondlife" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>secondlife</span></a> (vaak) recently vanished from within SL, seemingly lapsed on their sim rent to Linden Labs, and I’m still mad their surreal Scifi sim was replaced by a generic modern city after one of the Chungs swooped up the region for their land rental empire </p><p>I do hope tho the creator behind Vaak is like … alive</p>
