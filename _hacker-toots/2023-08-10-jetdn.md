<p>I have to figure out how to tell people around me that when I&#39;m on a day off, I want to mostly be left alone, unless I take it upon myself to go out and do things.</p><p>I want to be left alone, not talked to about work, not reminded of work, not interrupted from the things I&#39;m working on. </p><p>I have almost no peace, no silence and it&#39;s driving me nuts. </p><p>If rent prices weren&#39;t ridiculous I would live in a dark cave where I don&#39;t have to talk to anyone when I&#39;m not at work</p>
