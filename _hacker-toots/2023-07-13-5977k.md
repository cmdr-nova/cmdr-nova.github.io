<p>But, the idea I&#39;m building in my head without having written anything further, is that these engines alter space and time every single time they&#39;re fired. And in the 3rd of 4th chapter, the story jumps to the perspective of the actual main character who is aboard an ark-life vessel carrying millions of people, and some kind of problem redirects the main character toward piloting a smaller vessel off of and away from the ark, and having to reset her trajectory back toward Earth, she would need to somehow alter the motion said smaller ship would already be in from having launched from a ship traveling faster than the speed of light</p>
