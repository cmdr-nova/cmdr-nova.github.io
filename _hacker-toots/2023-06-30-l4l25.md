<p>The question I have for the admins who fully plan on federating with meta, in whatever way meta decides to implement itself in the fediverse, is: Why did you join Mastodon/Activitypub? </p><p>Because the original goal was to escape exactly that and other corporations</p><p>So, why are you here?</p>
