<p>It came to light that the creator of the elf ears that are sold alongside the Lelutka heads (at the Lelutka store itself) is a racist who uses racial slurs in their keywords for the marketplace search (I can&#39;t imagine why other than to just be hateful in the most obscure and weirdest way), and has campaigned against other creators for the crime of making their own elf ears.</p><p>So as a reminder, my store sells elf ears and I don&#39;t use racial slurs as keywords on my product pages</p>
