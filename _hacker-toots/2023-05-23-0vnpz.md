<p>Since the early 00s I&#39;ve been inclined to creativity. I started writing books at the age of 22, and although amatuer, managed to publish them myself.</p><p>Now, in 2023, I&#39;m (slowly) working on writing two books, Dusk Incarnate, a modern vampire story, and Dissolution Protocol, a space opera.</p><p>------------</p><p>I&#39;ve also been big into making music, since 2017, when I was coming off the heels of harassment in a job for my transition (currently paused until I can reach a better position in life). Under the moniker <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/Eyeshadow2600FM" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Eyeshadow2600FM</span></a>, I&#39;ve released 22 different pieces, and am working on my next (this number will change, and maybe so will this post!).</p><p>Link: <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p><p><a href="https://hackers.town/tags/sythwave" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>sythwave</span></a> <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/retro" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>retro</span></a> <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/electro" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>electro</span></a> </p><p>------------</p><p>I also run a <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/SecondLife" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>SecondLife</span></a> store, since 2015, which I originally erected in the virtual world as my first attempt at trying to make my own income, away from the world of the emotional distress of the public. Having taught myself how to model in Blender, I&#39;ve amassed a business with nearly 300 different products, currently sitting on a sim that I own and run myself.</p><p>In-world location: <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Neo%20Machina/177/172/24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">http://</span><span class="ellipsis">maps.secondlife.com/secondlife</span><span class="invisible">/Neo%20Machina/177/172/24</span></a></p><p>Web location: <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/165186" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">marketplace.secondlife.com/sto</span><span class="invisible">res/165186</span></a></p><p>------------</p><p>I&#39;ve also dabbled in the creation of <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/NFTs" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>NFTs</span></a>. I came into this particular world partially in-disgust at the artificial nature of it all. A lot of the &quot;creators&quot; posting auto-generated pieces that they didn&#39;t even make themselves, in a quick cash-grab attempt to make millions off of unsuspecting people.</p><p>So, ill-advised or not, I decided I wanted to buck this trend, and make something by hand. And I did. And then I got featured by the official Twitter account (before the website turned sour). I still have this collection, and another I started linked and listed on OpenSea, but am currently not adding anything new as I have a lot that I work on as it is.</p><p>------------</p><p>In the real world, I&#39;m currently a supervisor/manager at a large retail chain, and it is my hope that I can either move up the corporate ladder enough that I can just work from home, or use all of my skills listed here to simply not work for them anymore, at some point. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve written all of this here.</p><p>------------</p><p>I&#39;ve been on a lot of different instances, but hackers.town has been my home for years, and will likely be for a long time to come.</p>
