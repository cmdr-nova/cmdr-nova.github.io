<p>A week or so ago when I finished another track for Dissolution Protocol, I realized I&#39;m boxing myself into a rush to meet deadlines for release that I set for MYSELF</p><p>And I&#39;m not going to pay attention to the release date, because I want to make the best music I can, and if I have to keep pushing the date, I frikken will, even if it costs me sales</p>
