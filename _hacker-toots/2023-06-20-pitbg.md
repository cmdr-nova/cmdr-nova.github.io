<p>My boss hasn&#39;t responded to me, I wonder if he&#39;s mad I didn&#39;t get on Diablo last night</p><p>But that&#39;s the thing, I spent 4 years sitting in a room by myself mostly just making things in Second Life and music, and then I went back to my old job and have been spending all my free time sitting in a room by myself doing what I want</p><p>It becomes a comfortable habit, not having to perform for anyone, not doing anything for anyone but myself</p>
