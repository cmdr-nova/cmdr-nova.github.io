<p>I never did mention on here that I got featured by the official Twitter account in the beginning of 2022 with my hand-drawn NFT project lol</p><p>It&#39;s how I afforded new glasses, a replacement car and a bunch of Apple tech.</p><p>I still don&#39;t know if this was a good idea, but I drew all of what I made by hand, and most you&#39;ll see on social media was auto and AI generated to entice stock market gamblers</p><p>I just wanted to make art and a persistant income off of that art, but persistant it was not</p>
