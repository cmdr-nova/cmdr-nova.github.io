<p>Walmart has this crap habit of merging departments and putting one person in charge expecting it to always work out no matter what</p><p>So Iâ€™m in charge of 4 areas/departments and because one of my ppl switched to a different shift and the only other one went on vacation, Iâ€™m getting exactly 1 department done everyday ðŸ˜‚</p>
