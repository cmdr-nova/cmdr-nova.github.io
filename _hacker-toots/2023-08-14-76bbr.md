<p>@andi@strangeobject.space I&#39;ve been trying to get used to bluesky. Got harassed by someone for being in my 30s, seeing nothing but constant shitposting and ppl arguing over the weirdest things, and if you&#39;re a new account you might as well be farting in an empty tube lol</p><p>I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s worth anyone&#39;s time</p>
