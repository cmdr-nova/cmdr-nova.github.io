<p>@alex_02@infosec.exchange I find that it&#39;s really hit or miss. I can play Sims 4 no problem, I think I even launched and played the latest Modern Warfare on this thing (but it crashes out after a while lol). But then Firestorm only lets me utilize like 700 megs of texture memory so the buffer fills up over and over and it goes bonk</p>
