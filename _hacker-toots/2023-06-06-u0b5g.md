<p>Plugged my Xbox back in because there are a lot of features xbox has that I miss only ever using my PS5</p><p>So then I download Goldeneye and it’s perfect, they couldn’t have done this any better, it’s just like my childhood </p><p>And then I find out one of my fave games is 310 megabytes lol all of that, crammed into something that could fit on a mid 2000s ram stick</p>
