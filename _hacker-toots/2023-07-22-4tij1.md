<p>In Second Life there&#39;s a vampire RP hud that lets you bite other players, except you have to ask. Some people don&#39;t like this, and I&#39;m not even sure anyone really goes around asking strangers all that much</p><p>So of course, many sims (servers) have put up bots that spam you with notifications to take off your vampire fangs or get booted</p><p>which is very likely much more annoying than a stranger asking you for a bite every once in a blue moon ðŸ˜‚â€‹</p>
