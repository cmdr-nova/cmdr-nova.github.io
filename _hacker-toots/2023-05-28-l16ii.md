<p>Ah I think I figured out why I paused writing this Dissolution Protocol book, am writing it in 3rd person and started writing an intertwined story where the horror of the main character being lost in space is interrupted by characters on an earth like planet living in a cyberpunk dystopia lol</p><p>Maybe I should erase that part and focus on the main ~thing~</p>
