<p>@deadbeefmonster the album and its tracks follow this kind of story i built in my head a long time ago, that also plays out through the albums Ride Eternal and Polybius. They&#39;re technically linked together, and this new one is meant to &quot;end&quot; the pretend story in my brain, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to actually &quot;end&quot;</p>
