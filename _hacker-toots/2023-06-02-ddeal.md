<p>oh, the only reason you can&#39;t load up a current version of fortnite on a mac is because of the dispute between epic and apple over whether apple should be allowed to have sales commision through their app store</p><p>I mean, if I had an app store and people were selling things through it, I&#39;d probably charge a percent for commision</p><p>but also both of these companies are rich beyond comprehension</p>
