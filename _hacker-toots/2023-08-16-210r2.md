<p>I just really dunno what I want to do for sure in this first BG3 act, because if you decide to do the bad thing, it makes you go all the way</p><p>Like, if irl you think about punching someone, it&#39;s like if god himself came out of the sky and said &quot;no half measures&quot; and turned you into a serial killer</p>
