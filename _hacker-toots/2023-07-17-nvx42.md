<p>So I couple days ago I posted about this video I made in half-joking style where I showed off how terriblly messed up my department was at work. This went all the way to corporate, and they basically came down on the store and forced my boss to do work and help get it fixed.</p><p>It&#39;s fixed.</p><p>I got a little talking to and figured, ay, won&#39;t happen again.</p><p>Oh, but now the store manager is giving me attitude everyday, and my boss is calling my personal cellphone to ask why he didn&#39;t know about this or that in my department (because he&#39;s never asked about any of it in the past 5 months) and threatening me with &quot;don&#39;t let it happen again.&quot;</p><p>I WANT. OUT. OF. THIS. JOB.</p>
