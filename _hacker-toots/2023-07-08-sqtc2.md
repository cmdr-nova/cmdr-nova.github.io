<p>I was trying to reconcile my feelings about having a wildly different/current outward offline appearance than my <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/secondlife" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>secondlife</span></a>  avatar, because many people in SL very much hate when you don&#39;t look like your avatar</p><p>But I decided gender is a fuck and doesn&#39;t matter</p>
