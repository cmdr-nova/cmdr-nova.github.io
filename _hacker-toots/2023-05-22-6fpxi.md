<p>I&#39;m asking reddit for dating advice</p><p>Yes I know this is a very bad decision and I probably shouldn&#39;t</p><p>But I met this girl on okcupid and we talked legit for 5 hours, and now it&#39;s done to 1 word replies, i.e., the end of interest, which is wild, I don&#39;t understand and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong anymore</p>
