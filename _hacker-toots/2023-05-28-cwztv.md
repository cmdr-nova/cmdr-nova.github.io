<p>One of the things that an environment like Twitter ingrains in you, after years of use, is the need to conjure up something to propose and then be angry about. Doesn&#39;t matter if it actually happened, has happened, or will ever happen; This is how that algorithm works, what if favors or favored the most</p><p>And it&#39;s a really unhealthy personality quirk to develop from Twitter usage, and it takes a long time to even know you do it</p>
