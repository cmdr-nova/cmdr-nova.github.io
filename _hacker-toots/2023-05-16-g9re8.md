<p>I&#39;ve been rapidly gaining weight, and this has never happened to me before. I assume it&#39;s because of stress, and as I get older I&#39;m starting to feel like I&#39;ll never find a partner who really vibes with me, and so we&#39;re hitting depression. </p><p>I feel like I&#39;m on autopilot 75% of my day, each day, and I&#39;m eating garbage all the time.</p><p>I have to change something</p>
