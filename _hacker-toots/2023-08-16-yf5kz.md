<p>Alright, so I&#39;ve restarted my save before the Grove raid, and I&#39;m assuming that in order to keep the Drow leader and the goblins from attacking me in the night, I have to ... let the Drow leader sleep with my character</p><p>But I don&#39;t wanna?? My character is banging Lae&#39;zel lol</p>
