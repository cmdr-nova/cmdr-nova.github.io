<p>Saw that one woman on fedi who once bought me Sims 4 Vampires, and then booted me from her instance and blocked me after I had a severe mental break on her instance. It was a bad time for me, and it&#39;s also curious she posts trans fundraisers as if she didn&#39;t kick a suffering trans woman to the curb just barely 3 or 4 years ago</p><p>I don&#39;t let anything go ðŸ˜­â€‹</p>
