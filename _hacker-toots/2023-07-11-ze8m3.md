<p>This guy at work who was working with/for me in the depts I supervise, who took 2 week long vacations in a single month after my only other guy transferred out with zero replacement, screwed over nonstop, doing the job of like 7 people at once, getting almost nothing done because I have nobody to work anything</p><p>Then Mr. Double Vacation transfers out cause he wants something new, and has the audacity to grumble when I ask him to the check on the 2 week employee who hardly knows what he&#39;s doing while I take a single day off</p><p>I know work blows ass but the audacity and selfishness of people is ridiculous and I want to quit my job sometimes,, like right now</p>
