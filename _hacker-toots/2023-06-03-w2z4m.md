<p>I was thinking earlier about this haunted house I lived in when I was 16. I&#39;m kind of obsessed with it because it&#39;s the clearest proof I&#39;ve ever had that ghosts are a thing that are 100% real</p><p>And I had like 30 second long nonstop chills</p><p>I have to go back to this house when it is inevitbly vacated</p>
