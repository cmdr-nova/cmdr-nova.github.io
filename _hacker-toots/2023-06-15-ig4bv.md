<p>Whoa someone just proposed that Marty died twice in Back to the Future on the theory as to thats how Doc knew exactly where to be to save him from Biff both times (from being shot off a roof and then hit by his car)</p><p>The wild thing is IT MAKES SENSE because future Doc would have already known that Marty saved his life because that’s the nature of the time continuum</p>
