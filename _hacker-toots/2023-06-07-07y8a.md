<p>huh, so ESO has separate servers depending on what platofrm you use. This is largely because Zenimax wants you to pay multiple times, and therefore absolutely will not merge their servers together for crossplay.</p><p>Unless, apparently, if you have gamepass ultimate, at which point you can load up the xbox cloud on your pc or laptop, and then stream ESO from the xbox servers, to your PC and effectively not have your account be restricted to one platform</p><p>Neat</p>
