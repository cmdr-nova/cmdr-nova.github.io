<p>Relativity _seems_ wild and unbelievable, because how could space and time warp and be different for 2 parties on different ends of a string? But space isn’t a plane that you walk across, it’s a field of time that you push through, and it’s absolutely ridiculous. Black holes even more ridiculous.</p>
