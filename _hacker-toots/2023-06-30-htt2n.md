<p>I commented on a peertube video but I really want to delete my twitter and reddit accounts once and for all, but what&#39;s make it hard to do that for me is that there&#39;s just history there. If I delete my entire twitter existence, will people still find the things I make? Am I going to sit here in 5 years and go, &quot;you know I kind of want to log into my old twitter, just for kicks and shittles&quot; (even tho twitter is probably on the way out sooner than 5 years)</p>
