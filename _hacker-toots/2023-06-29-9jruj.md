<p>So, after the most hellish month possible at work, and having to work around one of my people taking multiple vacations in one month, and losing another person to a store transfer that was approved without a replacement, and then later having to train a brand new employee while the aforementioned is all happening at the same time, and then having to dispose of every chilled product in the store due to coolers going down, after all of that, they gave me 2 days off, 1 day on and then another day off</p><p>Of course I&#39;m going to call off on friday ðŸ˜‚â€‹</p>
