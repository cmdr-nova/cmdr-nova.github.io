<p>A lot of <a href="https://hackers.town/tags/secondlife" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>secondlife</span></a> photographers and stores post on Flickr, as do I, because a lot of people look there for fun and for products to check out</p><p>And a lot of both of these types are running their avatars and store adverts through AI to give them AI generated smiles and eyelids and I can&#39;t emphasize this enough: But it looks creepy as hell</p>
