<p>I was watching this guy on youtube talk about the difficulties of being a youtuber, and how like, if they took a break for a few days, or talked about something other than their extremely specific topic, people would unsubscribe in droves</p><p>and I want to know what kind of person, or people, since it&#39;s thousands, actually make the effort to hit &quot;unsubscribe&quot; when someone they watch hasn&#39;t posted in a few days, or doesn&#39;t talk about minecraft</p><p>that&#39;s a level of obsession I will never reach</p>
