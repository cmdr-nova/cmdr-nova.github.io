<p>I&#39;m actually strongly considering not using Twitter anymore. I&#39;ve been thinking about how in the past couple months I&#39;ve gotten no real new organic interaction with myself or my work on there, and my regular posts, even the jokes that I know are funny go nowhere. Like I&#39;ve been identified as someone who isn&#39;t the new audience of birbsite</p>
