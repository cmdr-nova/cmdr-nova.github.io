<p>I remarked on a bluesky &quot;skeet&quot; where someone said that ppl are hella weird for acting like a 32 y/o woman looking good is strange, saying i&#39;m like 38 and everyone thinks i&#39;m 25</p><p>and this 4chan addicted jerk came into my replies unprompted and called me middle aged, and then pulled an uno reverse when i told them to fuck off and eat shit ðŸ˜‚â€‹</p>
