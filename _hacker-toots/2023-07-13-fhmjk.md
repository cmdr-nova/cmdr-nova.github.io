<p>Been thinking about this deep space, breaking the rules of physics book I&#39;m writing. About launching a starship from a massive ark vessel, and how you would need to somehow alter the trajectory of the ship launching from the other ship that&#39;s in full motion, and how the bigger ship could take thousands of lightyears to come to a full stop</p><p>Got me wanting to watch some space movies or tv, then I remembered I haven&#39;t started Strange New Worlds yet</p>
