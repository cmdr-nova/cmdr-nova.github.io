<p>I still do have to praise the m1 macbook air (with the 16 gig upgrade and terabyte hdd), because if I put it side by side with my dell inspiron and open sims 4, only one of them can have an internet browser open with 18 tabs and a second life client running and experience no performance drops</p><p>it&#39;s the macbook</p>
