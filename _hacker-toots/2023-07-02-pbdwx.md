<p>I think about the times after I left wallyworld the first time, and I started a business in Second Life and I&#39;d sit at a bar in a virtual world crafting things in Blender, learning as I went. I think about spending hours writing until I had 6 novels started and none complete ðŸ˜‚â€‹ And I think about teaching myself FL Studio until I released an album that made me the number 1 electronic producer in my state for about a month</p><p>I don&#39;t think about the daily grind of processing losses at work endlessly until my hair falls out</p>
