<p>I want my SL store to be more recognizable and bigger in SL, because I see stores that have been around for a year being something people talk about, just because they attend or are accepted into shopping events</p><p>But at the same time I don&#39;t want my store in shopping events where I&#39;m forced to make something for said event and also pay for my own presence ðŸ˜‚â€‹</p>
