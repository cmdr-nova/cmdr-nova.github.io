<p>Yeah, definitely feel like I&#39;m going to try and have patrons migrate to Ko-fi, I like their site quite a bit more than Patreon, especially since it seems that Ko-fi actually has some discoverability unlike Patreon where you&#39;re basically a creator on an island shutoff from everyone else</p>
