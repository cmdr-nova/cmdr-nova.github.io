<p>And of course this would be doubly unbelievable to some, because we don’t experience anything special like this on Earth. We’re used to seeing the moon. We’re used to seeing the Sun. It’s normal, we don’t question it. So the idea of jumping through space and time while the Earth crumbles sounds like a movie, but it’s real, and none of us will ever see it :ablobthirst:</p>
