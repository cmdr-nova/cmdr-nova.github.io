<p>That is not to say I didn&#39;t receive monetary support in forms of online donation and irt the things I make (and still do)</p><p>But as far as emotional and transition support, there was none</p><p>People online were vicious, a clinic I went to prescribed the wrong amount of estrogen, and then my primary physician left her job and went elsewhere. Relied on the black market, faced constant anger and hate online right up until I took a hiatus from music due to the shitshow that was the twitter synthwave clique </p><p>It&#39;s just not a very good story and whenever I meet a trans girl offline they&#39;re always trying to pressure me to continue, but I don&#39;t have a support group, and I never did</p>
