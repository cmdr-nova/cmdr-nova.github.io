<p>since I screwed myself over by missing and then deleting a potential job lol does anyone have a remote job that pays that you&#39;re trying to fill?</p><p>I have manager/supervisor experience, community management experience, html, css and javascript experience. Let me build your website and be your team manager for 20 - 25 dollars an hour and I will stay for life lol</p>
