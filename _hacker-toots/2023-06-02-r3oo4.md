<p>if epic would update fortnite to work on m1/m2, i could cancel out my geforce now subscription, cause this is currently the only way i can go to my brother&#39;s place and play fortnite with them lol</p><p>which reminds me of a fun fact, if you install fortnite on a mac, you can load up the game and launch a session</p><p>except the game is permanently stuck in like chapter 1 season 2</p>
