<p>So, I decided to go through with the entire raid of the Grove, you lose multiple party members, have to convince your wizard buddy to stay, and then the drow plus goblins attack you in your camp ANYWAY</p><p>I may as WELL just save the Grove if the other option is being completely screwed lol</p>
