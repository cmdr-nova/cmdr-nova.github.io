<p>It sucks /r/traa(ns??) is going away due to reddit changes (I stopped using trans related subreddits back in 2014 when the measure of how good you were was how nice your selfie was), but the lack of energy to just make a discord and continue the community because being a live moderator is hard, or just, gosh forbid, coming to mastodon</p><p>Seems like they were waiting for a reason to shut it all down</p>
