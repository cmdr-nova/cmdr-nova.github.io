<p>I&#39;m gonna nip the fourth (or fifth?) CW war in the bud before the new influx throws up its arms</p><p>CWs are a common sense thing, you should CW sensitive topics, but it&#39;s okay to forget sometimes, because we&#39;re all human</p><p>But, on the flipside, it&#39;s important not to be a fediverse police officer, and if someone is posting things you don&#39;t want or like to see, there are extensive muting tools at your disposal.</p><p>There, war averted</p>
