<p>you know i just realized that if i would&#39;ve just not gone back to work in 2020, i would&#39;ve gotten multiple stimulus payments that could have supported me staying at home and focusing on my creative work lol</p><p>sure i wouldn&#39;t have begun to repair my fear of everyone around me, but i could&#39;ve kept doing that for a little while longer</p>
