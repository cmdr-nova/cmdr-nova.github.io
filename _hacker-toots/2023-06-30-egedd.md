<p>People are sharing their thoughts and feelings on leaving Reddit, and I don&#39;t have many aside from having posted there on multiple accounts over a decade, but nothing really ... stand-out</p><p>Twitter on the other-hand, I remember when people followed each other and had conversations. And I remember watching that slowly melt away into a platform about farming clout, about farming engagement, about doing numbers and gaining followers no matter the cost.</p><p>And then it became a website that touted itself as the place to be for creators, while simultaneously being a place that pisses me off every single time I look at it.</p><p>Then it was bought by a monumentally huge piece of garbage who amped up the volume on the &quot;pisses you off&quot; aspect by 1000</p><p>A true anti-social network</p><p>A social network that manipulates your emotions to get a reaction out of you to keep you there is terrifyingly bad. And I think maybe I&#39;m ready to delete it</p>
