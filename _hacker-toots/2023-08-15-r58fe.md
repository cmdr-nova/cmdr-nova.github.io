<p>So, here&#39;s the track record I&#39;ve built sort of unintentionally.</p><p>I made my way to the Goblin camp, and freed the writer and the tortured prisoner, but not without torturing him first, which accidentally revealed the Grove&#39;s location to the goblins, and also broke my Oath.</p><p>I decided to keep my Oath broken.</p><p>Then, I killed Halsin, because I figured it was either that, or fight my way out of an entire fortress of Goblins, didn&#39;t feel like doing that.</p><p>Then I reported to the Drow leader, and rather than probably die right there, I decided to befriend her as an Absolute.</p><p>Now, I&#39;m faced with the decision of either killing everyone in the Grove, or suddenly doing a full heelstep, and defending the Grove.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what to do. I have some side quests I can go on while I deliberate my decision, but I honestly am not sure what outcome I should choose.</p><p>Because if I go against the Goblins and the Drow leader now, it&#39;ll make no sense. Especially since I killed HALSIN.</p><p>So.........</p>
