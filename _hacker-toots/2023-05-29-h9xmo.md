<p>Interesting, I&#39;m on Intel&#39;s website and they&#39;re telling me Dell has a customized driver for Iris XE on my system, and if I want, I can install their generic graphics driver which may make things run better, BUT it could cause problems.</p><p>My problem is, I don&#39;t know if Dell&#39;s customized driver that came with the system is something I should replace with Intel&#39;s drivers or not</p>
