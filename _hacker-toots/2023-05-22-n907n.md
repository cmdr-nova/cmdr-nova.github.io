<p>I&#39;m consistently motivated to keep making things in my Second Life store but I&#39;ve hit my usual lul of having no ideas for things I want to make</p><p>And as far as music goes, I had something, but I decided I didn&#39;t like it enough to keep going, I&#39;m just doing the same thing I did on the past 2 albums and that&#39;s not good enough</p>
