<p>I like MOBAs, partially because it&#39;s half of the reason why games like World of Warcraft happened, but</p><p>Riot Games are complete amateurs and can&#39;t even properly balance a mobile game in the TRAINING pvp</p><p>Mobile legends is top tier, but it&#39;s almost too easy, like I&#39;m playing against 7 year olds.</p><p>There&#39;s no sweet spot, you either play a game against people who don&#39;t have jobs, or play against kids who rightfully don&#39;t have jobs</p>
