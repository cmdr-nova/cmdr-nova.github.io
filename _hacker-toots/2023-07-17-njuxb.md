<p>I&#39;m so stressed out I have regular heart palpatations that jolt me out of my sleep, and I only sleep 3 hours a night, and then I go to work to be talked down to by people who don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed to be doing, or what my job entails, asking me why they didn&#39;t know things that they&#39;ve never asked about before, and people trying to sabotage me left and right.</p><p>About to cut up all my credit cards and let carvana take my car back</p>
