It's been a little bit (like, about a week, I guess) since I wrote a full-form post. At least, ever since I put the ability to just post a Note directly onto the front page of my site. I like this new feature *a lot*. But, I wanted to write about Bluesky, again, because, as I centralize my posting as much as I can to this site, I'm trying to be more present across different places. And, well, Bluesky is simultaneously growing on me, and *not* growing on me.

Firstly, I'm *very* used to using Mastodon and Akkoma, and a lot of other ActivityPub associated software. Which means, I'm *also* used to people being considerate of others. And, what I mean by that, is, people not posting distressing or anxiety inducing things to the public, unfiltered, with zero warning. You go on Bluesky, and this is almost *the only thing you see and experience on the app*.

Just, a nonstop deluge of panic, panic, panic, bad, bad, bad, fight, fight, fight, and it makes scrolling ... *really hard*. I find, in fact, it's ... tough to find things that I'd actually want to hit the "fave" button on.

You have random people sharing their thoughts. Cool. You have people sharing their art, and *a lot of dudes sharing their penises*, and then you have the avalanche of people who thrive by living in constant fear and anxiety.

And that's just the *tip* of the iceberg.

You've got constant intra-community fighting among trans people, as if we've hitched that portion of Twitter to Busky, and turned it into a ride that never stops. And I know this myself, *very well*, because the bullies were out in full-force during the beta, closed-door phase of the app, and *they never left*. And now there are multi-thread posts on the timeline, *today*, of people trying to convince you that Mean Girling isn't actually Mean Girling, it's just people being outspoken and Right(TM), and everyone else is just *always* wrong.

Like when you tell someone to give warning before posting slurs and they jump you like a caffeine addicted twelve year old who only knows violence.

I may be projecting my own feelings a bit, and I don't have a whole lot of context as to why this is the current Discourse, but my point is: If an app is so toxic that we've got people writing about how being toxic is just a product of being right, something's *wrong*.

You *don't see that on Mastodon, or other ActivityPub apps*.

People aren't signing up on the fediverse and then diving into a nonstop merry-go-round of fighting just to prove that they're right, every minute of the day. And I know that a lot of this has to do with age. I've been there. I've done that. It's boring. It *sucks*. There are so many *better* things you could be doing with your time, than spitting venom at strangers that you believe to be part of your community, online.

I could go on and on about how this behavior is more the plight of people who feel as though they have no power, of people who have little self esteem, but really, I don't have a lot of confidence, or self esteem, and I'm pretty powerless to change *most* things in my life right now, and the only reason I'm not on Twitter 2: The Reckoning, yelling at people, is because I know better.

And we're still at the tip of the aforementioned iceberg.

Bluesky doesn't feel as personal to me. I didn't make any of it, I can't freely deploy whatever I want with, or on it, at least not without hours of figuring out how the hell their API works. The feeds were interesting at the beginning, but now it's just like, the same long list of feeds that have been there for *months* and *months*, and I'm to believe there are 30 million people on the network? You're telling me this one person who made an entire feed about themselves and nobody else, is one of the *most popular feeds*?

Okay.

But what about starter packs?

Yeah that fad died like a month ago. Starter, who?

I think, in regard to Bluesky, a lot of people are just waiting to see if the devs and the board are going to destroy what they've built with corporate influence. And, in the meantime, all of the things you *don't want to see* are just spilling over the timeline like old juice that got left out overnight, and it's got mold on it, and someone peed on it, and I think the dog *farted* somewhere close to it.

It's kind of, how did the bullies in high school phrase it? Uh, trifling.

"So you *hate* Bluesky?"

Not really. I think the software is fine, and I'd like to see it grow, and free itself from the shackles of the fake-decentralization that doesn't exist on AT Protocol. I think the *issues* with the app have a lot to do with people not being willing enough to leave behind their fight-or-also-fight attitudes on Twitter where they belong.

And it's confusing, because how did multiple social networks pop up over the past decade, and one of them is open and free, and not a place that's just people fighting and posting penis constantly, and the other one *is*?

Riddle me that, Batman.

But, I *want* to like Bluesky. I *want* to find ... community, of *some sort*, again. And I know posting this, and criticizing people who only know how to fight online, is only going to make them want to fight more. *If they even read anything I write*, which they don't. I'm just ... convinced that things could be better. In a world where everything is bad, and getting worse, there *has* to be a reason that things we interact with, interface with, can *get* better.

Problem is, people kinda sorta have to *want* things to be better.

I guess that's why, at the end of the day, I'm here, and I'm on ActivityPub. Because I can go there and post all my inane rambling and *nobody gives a shit*. Nobody's fighting me. Anyone so much as even slightly gives the impression that they're trying to fight, I zap them into the void.
