Now, obviously, I'm not fresh-out-the-womb. I'm 39, and I have experience with something that's very much like this. Okay ... maybe not *completely*, but, there was a time back in the nineties when interacting with strangers in a 3D environment was completely unheard of, and alien ... until Worlds Chat released.

I bring this up, not entirely because it's related to my requests for tips, or places to visit, but because I know VRC users might read this post, and I want you to see where this all came from. It's *essentially* the same thing, huh?

And, although [it's still running today](https://www.worlds.com/){:target="_blank"}, the company is desperate for new users, and are currently going down the road of incorporating blockchain, crypto, and NFTs into their software. So, I mean, they're essentially killing a thirty year old treasure.

But hey, at least there's VR Chat, ay? Let's hope VRC, Inc. is a little smarter about what they're doing and don't see fringe crypto gambling as a way to bolster user count (spoiler: it never does).
