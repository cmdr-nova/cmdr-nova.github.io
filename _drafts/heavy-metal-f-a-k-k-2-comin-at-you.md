title: Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, Comin' At You?
---
While I'm on this kick of looking back over the years at old games that are still mega-popular, I also want to look at games that maybe *nobody* remembers, or even *knows* about. No, I'm not talking about Daikatana. That game is pretty cool, and I'm pretty sure it's also very well known. I'm talking about Julie and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, a game that came, said, "Hey!" and then vanished into the ether of game development ... seemingly, *forever*.
