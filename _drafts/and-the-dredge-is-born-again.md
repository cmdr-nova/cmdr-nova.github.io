Over the course of the last year, as I mentioned in my post on here about having to *shutdown* my city, Neo Machina, in Second Life. It had experienced a few temporary shutdowns before that. During one of those shutdowns, I briefly erected a small near double-parcel sized *street* of the city, and called it, Neo Machina: The Dredge.

Well, with the sim/homestead shutdown, and it being entirely up in the air if it ever comes back (money is a tight piece of crap), I scoured Second Life for a way to keep *something* going. Because ... well, because deleting months, six months, a year or more of work, just didn't sit well with me.

So, it's back, on a quarter sim. Funnily enough, I have *more* "space" to work with, as far as placing objects goes, than I ever did on a homestead. It's just a smaller area, which isn't all that much of a disadvantage, because now there can be fewer blank spaces or filler. I've spent some time rebuilding, and I've got the apartments back online, and fully redesigned to be more ... friendly, to living within. I've also restored the 100 land impact limit the apartments had when my homestead was briefly a full region.

I don't expect everyone, or even *anyone* to come back. This is probably a pain in the ass to people watching from the outside.

But, I *promise*. When I find some kind of work, or job, in the tech/web development field, I *assure you* I'll be making enough to not even have to *think* about all of this. And *maybe* running a city in Second Life really isn't all that important to most, or all of people, ever. But it means something *to me*, and that's all that matters.

You can come see the new location, and rebuild, [here](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Androviel/27/72/2005){:target="_blank"}. As I've said, the apartments are back online and ready to use, but *pretty much everything else* is still under construction. The only reason I'm opening it now, because it is at least good enough for eyes to see it.
