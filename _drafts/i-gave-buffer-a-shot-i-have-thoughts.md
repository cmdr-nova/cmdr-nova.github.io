title: 'I Gave Buffer a Shot: I Have Thoughts'
---

A while back, I put up a [post about Bluesky](/social media/2024/07/31/bluesky-part-3-all-your-data-are-belong-to-us/) announcing their partnership with cross-posting company, "Buffer" (Yes, I'm aware that it's starting to look like I have multiple topics that are an ongoing series on this website). I also detailed how this was a bad move, because Buffer is using OpenAI tech in their backend, and even though they *say* it's just an option you can utilize with writing posts ... based on how OpenAI has been conducting themselves, I don't fully trust *any* company that thinks it's a good idea to use their tech. Regardless, since I run a lot of different social media accounts, and I thought it could make things easier for me, like when I write blog posts, or have new music, I decided to give it a whirl!

Here are my thoughts.

The website itself is very well organized, you can connect your socials, and it even has a calendar that displays ... *everything* you've ever posted on your connected accounts, chronologically by time and date (which ... is actually pretty *worrying* if you don't think they're using that OpenAI tech ethically), and you can do a few other things. Such as, you can create a "start" page, which is just a rip of Link-tree. The downside, is that creating a Buffer version of Link-tree takes up one of your social connections.

But, how *many* are you allowed to connect on a free account?

Three.

Or, if you want a page with all your links provided by Buffer, essentially, you can connect *two* accounts.

So, basically, if you're using the free Buffer plan, you may as well not even be there. If you can't manage two accounts without the help of some software ... geez, dude.

Okay, but how much does it cost to upgrade to have *more* connections.

Short answer: Way to goddang much.

Long answer: (20 USD a month for 4 accounts, 25 for 5, a whopping 50 for 10, while calling itself a value for individual creators, paying less for spotify, or even apple plus sub, I have around 7 or 8 socials, down one after having deleted twitter. or, hey! You can subscribe for 15 a month and ... pay them for the amounts of accounts you can connect, for free? oh and sure, have a few more useful features I guess. consensus is that 3 is too little for a "creator" and paying any amount for more is far too much. mention that the ai features are shoehorned repeatedly on the same pages)

(more about how this is being advertised to independent, individual users as a good way to manage their Bluesky account alongside others they may have)

(ripped the start page, deconstructed the CSS, and rebuilt it for free, as my own link page, here: )

(rebuilt, put css in it's own file, because why tf are you putting it in the same page??? redesigned the buttons, renamed all css elements to something humerous, deleted all their link tracking, added an rss feed at the bottom to replace the static updates section where links weren't even clickable, rss functionality courtesy of brenton fletcher's rss.bloople.net)
