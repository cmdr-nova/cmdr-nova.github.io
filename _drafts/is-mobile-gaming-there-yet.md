I ask the question, "Is mobile gaming there yet?" And what I mean by that is, is it what a hardcore, no-lifer, 360-no-scope Call of Duty player would call "gaming?" Probably not. But, what I want to explore, is whether it's actually *fun* now, whether there are *real* gaming titles on mobile that aren't just a ploy to sell ads, to force you to watch ads, or if we're still in the Dark Ages of mobile games. I wouldn't be writing this if I thought that we were.

I come from decades of watching gaming grow, from Doom, to Halo, to Mass Effect, to Cyberpunk 2077, and seeing the life and *death* of Facebook gaming (The Sims Social, Mafia Wars, YoVille). The olden days of mobile games when it was just Snake, and then it was cheap attention-eaters, like Candy Crush Saga--Games meant to fill a gap in time with something not so much fun and engaging, but mind-numbing, with micro-transactions.

And now, here we are, today, in 2025.

Is mobile gaming more than just a bunch of time wasters?

If you've been alive for the past 10 years, you probably already know the answer to that question. *Yeah*, there are some pretty awesome games on mobile now. And, before we go any further, I just want to list my top 10.

1: Genshin Impact

2: Zenless Zone Zero

3: Diablo Immortal

4: Castles

5: AFK Journey

6: Wuthering Waves

7: COD Warzone

8: Sims FreePlay

9: Warframe

10: Infinity Nikki

*I don't mention The Sims Mobile in this list, because, while I have played it, it hardly counts as a Sims game, and it's missing so many staple features of the franchise, I would hardly call it a game.*

All of these titles could be considered regular *normal* games. Some of them are even on Steam, and one of them is a title that's *always been* a PC game, that with some kind of magic, got ported to mobile. You could say that each and every single one of these titles has some sort of tactic or feature that's been a staple of mobile gaming for the past decade, and/or, something that makes it *less fun* to engage with. But, I would have to probably also state, that I think PC and console gaming has absorbed those features and tactics.
