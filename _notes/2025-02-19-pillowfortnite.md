Hello Pillowfortnite, it's been a little while since I've posted here, and that's mostly because I'm constantly scattering back and forth between social websites due to the fact that, once Twitter died, I kind of lost my feeling of centrality on the internet.

I think I've got the handle on that though, because, even though I post here, I post on ActivityPub, I post on Bluesky, you know, I've been running a website this whole time.

So, what I did was, is I decided to make my website the central place of balance of my internet presence. In that, along with blog posts on the main feed on the site itself, it now also features "notes" and "logs.

Notes are basically social media posts that I've written directly onto my website, as well, with links to their social media counterpart (as if it's syndicated), and logs are just me posting changelogs about my site.

It creates this unique kind of opportunity to turn my website into my own personal social feed.

... if only I could figure out an easy way to create a note, build it via Jekyll, and then push it to github and then Neocities ... via my phone!

I know one way I could do this, but it's kind of a major project to setup, and I've got this feeling in my brain juice that I could probably think of an even easier way to do it.

Maybe.
