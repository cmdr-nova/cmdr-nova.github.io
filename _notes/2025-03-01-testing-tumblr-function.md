With this post, I'm testing functionality of using a Python script to post the full content of a feed item from my website to Tumblr, with some links and what-not at the bottom. This, will, of course, update to all sources that receive my RSS feed, but if you're viewing this from Tumblr, *specifically*, this *should* show the full text, with a link to the original feed item, plus a link to where you can find me on Mastodon.

Let's pop this baby in and see what happens.
