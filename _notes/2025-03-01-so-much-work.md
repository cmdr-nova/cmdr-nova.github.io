I'm made a lot of progress on the website. All of my Mastodon posts are feeding in-ward and posting automatically as separate feed items, and the RSS is out-ward processing Posts, Logs, and Notes as feed items for subscribers separate from Mastodon to read. And, now, feed items also (should) post to Tumblr as if they're *regular* posts.

What's next?
