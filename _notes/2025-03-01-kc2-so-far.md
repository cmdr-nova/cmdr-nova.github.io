My game so far in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been littered with ... ridiculousness. I started the game (after the prologue) wanting to find the camping spot where all my buddies were apparently murdered, and got side-tracked looking for quests. Upon finally finding some, I descended about a few of them. One ... in which you're tasked with stealing a lute, and then finding new strings after they break it, and so on.

Basically, I've murdered three people in order to get and maintain a lute for no other reason than a hopeful reward? haha

But I *did* get my dog back.

Problem is, there are a few dead bodies hiding around that nobody's found, yet ...
