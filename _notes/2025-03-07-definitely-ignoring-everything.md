Love when people I'm mutuals with on social media, with whom I've interacted with for well over a year, suddenly start posting generative slop, *and* ask to be paid for generative slop via Patreon, as if I've never posted about how disgusting, destructive, and in violation of *literally everyone's* consent such things *are*.

Bro is definitely listening when we say, these algorithms are the tools of fascism.
