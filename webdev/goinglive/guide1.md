This is it, the moment you've been waiting for. But, you're probably thinking, "Aw gee, shucks. I don't want to pay for some service to host my site! I already pay for 47 streaming services, and 13 credit cards I had to use because eggs are 90 dollars a pack!"

Well, good news for you, then, because you don't have to.

<a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a> has been around for a while, and their service is entirely free-of-charge.

To add on top of the fact that it's a free place to host your website, *it also has a social community* where people can talk with you, see your updates, and follow you. And this is built directly into the dashboard!

So, this is mostly self explanatory, but I wanted to make sure to point you to the best place to host your site.

Just get on there, type in whatever you want your site name to be, tag it with whatever your site is about, and then choose a password and sign up.

You'll be met with the dashboard, where, in a dropdown menu containing your username at the top right, you can find account settings, and site settings. You might also notice that you can input a Paypal for tipping, you can setup a custom domain, you can link your Neocities address to your username on Bluesky, and you can subscribe for 5 bucks, in order to get like ... 50 gigs of space? I think?

But, if you're just making a tiny little site with mostly text, I wouldn't worry about running out of space, just yet.

In the next guide, I'll go over the easiest way to upload, without having to use just the dashboard for this.
