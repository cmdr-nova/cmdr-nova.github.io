Alright, buddy! Let's get your site uploaded!

So, on Neocities, you can just click that drop-down mentioned in the previous guide, and then "Edit" to be taken to a web interface where you can manually insert your files. You can totally do this, but first!

Delete all the files they have in there by default, except for the "index.html" (I'm fairly certain it won't let you do that).

And now, I don't use this method to upload my site to Neocities, but you *should* be able to drag and drop files into this space. If this is the route you want to take, open up the root folder of your website, select all, and then drag and drop.

*If that doesn't work*, then I am fairly certain you have to select individual files with the "upload" button. But make sure you get everything!

*I have been informed that the WebDAV method only works for those who are paying for Neocities, which was an oversight on my end. Because I've just always paid for Neocities. But the former methods should also work, and if your site isn't huge, it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to get it uploaded.*

Instead of doing, that, though, if you don't want to, we'll go over the easier way to do this.

If you're on Windows, go ahead and download <a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a>. Then (and I'm saying this based off of memory, because I'm not on Windows and haven't used it in quite some time) create a new connection. For the server, input "https://neocities.org/webdav" and for username and password, use your Neocities login name, and then password.

If done correctly, you should be able to connect directly to your site directory, and in doing so, it'll be ultra easy to just drag and drop your whole entire site right into that window.

Now, if you're on Linux, this is *even easier*. No downloads required.

Simply open your file manager, and then press CTRL + L to open up the location bar, and paste in "davs://neocities.org/webdav" and then in the window that pops up, enter your username and password for Neocities.

Voila.

Your Neocities account is now a temporarily mounted drive on your PC, where you can drag your website files.

Once you've done all of this, and you're *sure* everything is uploaded, and nothing's missing, simply navigate to your site url! This is going to be the name you registered with on Neocities and then .neocities.org.

So, your-username.neocities.org.

Congratulations! If everything, and I mean *everything* in these guides went off without a hitch, you now have a functioning personal website of your own, that you can continue messing with and building upon. Now, you're one step closer to being independent of social media, where everything you say and post is gone in less than thirty seconds to the eyes of strangers.
