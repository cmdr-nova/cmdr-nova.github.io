<p>Here you will find all sorts of things about me, such as how to boil pizza in water, where to find cool rocks, and what to do if you find yourself in an abandoned mall. Sometimes I like to browse <a href="https://www.lycos.com/" target="_blank">Lycos search</a> for cool images of dogs, but this has the tendency to over-excite me.</p>

<p>All-in-all, you should be very aware of the dangers of searching photos online. The stimulus can be endless, and your brain has the chance of exploding. And you don't want that. Because if your brain explodes, you might slip into some alternate dimension where there are two Yous, instead of just one You. What would you do about that? Would you try and get to know You two, or would you argue about who's number one and who's number two?</p>

<p>Personally, I tend to not dabble in experimentation with alternate dimensions, because that's how you end up quantum tunneling directly into The Complex, which is a very scary place. You don't want to go there. You will never leave.</p>
