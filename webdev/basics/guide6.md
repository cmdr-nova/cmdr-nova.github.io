title:  Let's Add Some Pages

We're *almost* there now. Almost to the point where you're ready to upload your website and have the world see it!

But, first, we should add some meta content to the head of your index page (and, you could add this to every single page, if you want).

We don't need previews here, so I'm just going to grab the head snippet from our index.html.

```
<head>
<title>My Cool Site | About Me</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/web"></script>
</head>
```

So, you see this here? This is *very* mother-farting basic. It's go almost *nothing* in it. It's basically just telling a browser what the title of your site is, and what styles and scripts to load, and that's it. But, in order to be more friendly to the internet, we should add some things.

```
<head>
<title>My Cool Site | About Me</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/web"></script>
</head>
```
