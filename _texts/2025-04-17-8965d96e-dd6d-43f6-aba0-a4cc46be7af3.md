<p>Today reinforcing that I need to find a new job lol<br><br>I make one mistake, by missing that inventory count needed adjusted by like 6 on a single item, store manage pulls exactly that item, and then slaps myself and the rest of my team with restrictions that will definitely keep us there longer, every single day<br><br>Bunch of crap<br><br>But that's how W*lmart operates</p>
