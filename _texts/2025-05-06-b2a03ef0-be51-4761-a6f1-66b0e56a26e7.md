<p>I was thinking about how dating apps suck, and how they're basically designed to keep you on the app. They exist to make money, not find you any love<br><br>And then I was like "I know a lot about web development" and "Dating sites in like 2010 were actually viable for meeting people"<br><br>There's like a microcosm of an idea brewing in there, but I don't know if I want to pursue it lol</p>
