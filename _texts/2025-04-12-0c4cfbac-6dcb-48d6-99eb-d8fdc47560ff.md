<p>I see the hackers people are moving servers. If you read the ramblings I make on the regular, and maybe at least sort of take heed in things I say: Maybe take this time to move somewhere else?<br><br>The admin and moderators behind h.t have _never_ answered for perma-banning my account that I had for 4 years+ while I was spiraling, in a bad place, and being outwardly harassed.<br><br>These people _protected_ a troll, and booted me to the curb. I gave _money_ to that instance, money I didn't even have at the time.<br><br>Take control of the fediverse away from apathetic, context-blind tech-bros, one brick at a time, and maybe show me that I'm not just yelling at a brick wall for years on end?</p>
