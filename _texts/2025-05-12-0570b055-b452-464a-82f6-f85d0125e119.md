<p>This WoW streamer talking for 20 minutes about how addons can take 4 hours to setup, they don't want to go into the details of how to do it but might in shorter videos. Talks about how their namplates are nice and won't talk about how to set them up because it's a long process and so on and so forth<br><br>So anyway, this streamer is using the Plater addon, and it takes 5 minutes to setup<br><br>Say someone else did your addon setup for you without saying it</p>
