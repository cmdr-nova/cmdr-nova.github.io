<p>So, the gist on how to spot AI writing on social media (at least), is that it's always going to read like it was professionally written by an author (probably because Sam Altman and Fark Fuckerberg ripped off authors for training all of this), and the narrator of whatever's written will always have a crystal clear memory of events no matter how much time has passed</p>
