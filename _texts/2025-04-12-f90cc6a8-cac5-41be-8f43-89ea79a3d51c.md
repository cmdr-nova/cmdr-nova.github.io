<p>I try to boost donation posts when I see them, but I've also noticed this trend as of the past couple years or so, where people who don't normally post something like that will preface their help post with something relating to shame in having to do so (like earlier I saw someone say "this is crazy to post, I know").<br><br>I don't know how to express, that, you shouldn't malign other poor people just because you never imagined you'd be one of them. In fact, that doesn't make me want to boost your post</p>
