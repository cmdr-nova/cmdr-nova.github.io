<p>Decided this 3 day set of days off I'd continue leveling my Evoker in WoW, which I haven't really played since Dragon Isles<br><br>I think I'm liking this class as much as the original hero class (Death Knight)<br><br>If you get your rotation down right, you can just blast through everything just as easily as a Mage but with more survivabilty</p>
