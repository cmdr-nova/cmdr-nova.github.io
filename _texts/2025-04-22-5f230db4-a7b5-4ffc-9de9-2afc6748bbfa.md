<p>So, I really like the world I have on Java edition, but it's kind of a bummer that Java edition on Linux is basically cut-off from outside players unless you buy a realm for Java, and then people can only join if you specifically individually invite them<br><br>Kinda lame<br><br>So I thought, "Well, what if I looked for a way to convert this world to bedrock?"<br><br>Well, I figured out how to do that, and put my mega awesome world INTO bedrock (sans the mods, because they were breaking everything and I reverted to vanilla)</p>
