<p>I decided to host my main Minecraft world on a Java realm, where you can see my base, and also the Steve's Lava Chicken restaurant (not currently functional as a place to eat chicken)<br><br>But, because of the way Mojang currently handles Java, you'll need an invite from me in order to join lol<br><br>Let me know if you want in!</p>
