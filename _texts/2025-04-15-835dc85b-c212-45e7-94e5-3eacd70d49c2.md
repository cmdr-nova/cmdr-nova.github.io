<p>I got this mod in my main Java world (minecraft) where a murderer is supposed to hunt your character relentlessly<br><br>But, I think I've played for about 3 hours since installing it and I haven't seen him once<br><br>Only thing I've experienced is walking through hallways and someone knocking 3 times on blocks as I pass, which is FREAKY</p>
