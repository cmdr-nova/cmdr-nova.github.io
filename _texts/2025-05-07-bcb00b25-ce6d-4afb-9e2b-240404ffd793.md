<p>well, I created a world in Minecraft Alpha, built a base, dug to bedrock, and then stepped it up throughout releases until I got it to 2025<br><br>They always warned stuff like "Be careful upgrading old worlds to new releases! Make a new one!" but the world looks remarkably almost exactly the same, with some strange terrain generation, and slate in-place of the bedrock that was there in the alpha version</p>
