<p>Trying to get myself into playing Minecraft on my Bedrock realm, because there's actually someone who logs in daily and builds stuff in their own base<br><br>And dang it's kind of hard to get used to Minecraft without added mods, struggling to find just steel and coal lol let alone diamonds. Find me walking into a cave system and turning 180 the second I see two creepers and a witch</p>
