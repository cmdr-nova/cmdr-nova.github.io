<p>So, it looks like, with all the 150 some mods I was using on my Java Minecraft world, all of it was working fine. I was exploring, carving out the map, looking for treasure in the Nether.<br><br>Then I found an ancient city in the deep dark, and this caused some kind of conflict (I think) so egregious that it destroyed the entire "modpack"<br><br>None of it works, it's all corrupted lol<br><br>... reverting back to my vanilla version of this world and save state</p>
