<p>looking at this toy set I accidentally bought, it makes me think of how when I was a kid I told myself "when I grow up I'm going to buy whatever cool stuff I want and nobody can say no!" and then when you DO grow up, it's like, this stuff isn't for me. But, I'll keep it, because it's what 13 y/o me would've wanted</p>
