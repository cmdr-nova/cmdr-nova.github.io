<p>Work is blowing up my and my co-supervisor's phone asking questions about last night and stuff to do with work. I don't normally answer because I'm at home, but my phone is exploding lol<br><br>So I went in there and I was like "Hey so every time either of us answer you we need to be paid" and everything stopped haha<br><br>(all of management is in this group chat)</p>
