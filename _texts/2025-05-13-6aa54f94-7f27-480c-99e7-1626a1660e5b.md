<p>Watching this guy on Youtube who is about just as old as me, talking about his original NES, been gaming since he was 10, and then he's like "I'm about to play Minecraft, get into this game my kids have been playing so I can join them"<br><br>And that's really nice and all, but you didn't hear about this game 15 years ago? haha</p>
