<p>I've been using bluesky to talk about the ways I was harmed in over 5 years of _stuff_ in relation to you-know-who, and it's brought awareness to that person and what she does, and I think it even helped a few people get away from her<br><br>But now I'm seeing people saying stuff like "Bluesky is banning trans people who post donation links"<br><br>Please come to ActivityPub, yall. Some dorks might complain about donation links but the entire network cannot ban you for it</p>
