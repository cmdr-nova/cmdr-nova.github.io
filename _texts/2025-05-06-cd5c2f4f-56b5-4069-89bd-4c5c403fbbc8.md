<p>I really like the main world I have built and am building a town in (in Minecraft), but I thought of this wild idea. I've been bummed for a bit that I never considered saving my original worlds to access at a later time<br><br>but<br><br>What if you went on Java and loaded an alpha instance of the game, and then started playing like normal, and then once you reach a milestone, you upgraded to beta, and so on and so forth until you've caught up with the current release<br><br>Sounds kinda fun</p>
