<p>watching someone's take on the Minecraft movie, I can't get enough of it lol<br><br>I love that there's a Herobrine reference and the editors try to play it off like they didn't mean to do that (they tried to remove herobrine, e.g., minecraft patch notes)<br><br>There needs to be a sequel and it needs to be about Herobrine</p>
