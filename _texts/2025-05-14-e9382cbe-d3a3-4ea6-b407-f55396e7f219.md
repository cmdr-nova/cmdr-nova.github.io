<p>Loaded up the latest Java snapshot, and it has the dried ghasts in it, but I wanted to see if you could just rescue a regular ghast from the nether, and then force them into an ocean (which is what they're looking for in the nether)<br><br>So, I used a creative spawn egg to spawn a normal ghast near an ocean, and it looks like a _regular_ ghast will actively seek and submerge itself in the water<br><br>but it's not looking like this will turn it happy (at least not yet)</p>
