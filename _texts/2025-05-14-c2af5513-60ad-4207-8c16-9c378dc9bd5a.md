<p>Viewing a lot of corporate social media from the outside, and even Bluesky and looking at how even while interacting with people, it seems dead. It all seems dead.<br><br>Doesn't really seem any different here, it's quiet at times, other times it's active. But I am starting to wonder if the internet is in fact actually dead and has been dead for a long time and we really are just seeing a bunch of bots talking back and forth on, like, Twitter and Threads</p>
