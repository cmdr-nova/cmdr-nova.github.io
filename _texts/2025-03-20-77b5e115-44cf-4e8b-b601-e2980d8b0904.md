<p>I'm watching one of AugustTheDuck's videos where he's critiquing stalker behavior of a bad dude following some girls who are doing IRL streaming on Twitch, and he remarks that he can't understand some of the comments being made in the stalker's defense, and later goes on to say "and on Twitter, they're saying THIS"<br><br>I need famous creators who are real busy and not paying attention, TO START PAYING ATTENTION.<br><br>The reason you're seeing weird shit on Twitter, is _because_ you're on Twitter.
