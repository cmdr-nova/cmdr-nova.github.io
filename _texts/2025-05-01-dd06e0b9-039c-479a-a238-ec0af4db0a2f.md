<p>I have determined the Warden is not a mob meant to be fought in Minecraft lol<br><br>on this server I have near full Netherite armor, a NR sword, enchanted to hell<br><br>I go down to the deep dark, attract his attention. He walks up beside and I take a swing with my sword<br><br>He turns and looks at me and I'm dead</p>
