<p>spent my second night off mostly on my java Minecraft world where I've built a base surrounded by deep-slate fences with an outdoor farm, and a chicken farm with only one chicken, cause I keep throwing in more eggs and nothing comes out. And then I had to research old forums to figure out why all the villagers in my village disappeared except for the one I'm holding hostage ...<br><br>And apparently they were probably all killed by zombies. So I built the survivor an enclosed chamber with a bed and a barrel and now he sells me fish</p>
