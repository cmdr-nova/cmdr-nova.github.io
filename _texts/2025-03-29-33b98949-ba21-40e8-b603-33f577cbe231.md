<p>I've seen a lot of sh*t at W*lmart over the years, including me being harassed for a year and a half for coming out as and being trans in the work-place. Probably one of, if not _the_ worst experience of my entire life. Management who would come into work in my first minutes of being there and gleefully misgender me, snicker behind my back. Associates who laughed as I walked by, or asked disingenuous questions about my transition, who I was, and about my life. Being stalked through the hallways, the guy who stood and stared at me dead-cold for an entire hour. The HR case of harassment that got dropped after an entire month, because I was too naive at the time to realize that HR is not there to protect you. The gay man who called me an 'it' in front of customers, the de-transed guy who slurred me and participated in actual real life "4chan trolling" _while we were working, etc, etc, etc, etc<br><br>I hope that girl who got fired takes them for everything they' re worth</p>
