<p>Finally listening to the full version of Kyle Gordon's nu metal track, and it made me realize the reason nowadays you never hear about anyone liking or listening to anything remotely close to metal anymore is because nu metal died<br><br>I remember when nu metal was the only thing on MTV2, on the radio, and movies were being made specifically centered around the music plus vampires (queen of the damned)<br><br>and then suddenly it was all just 20 copies of post malone who, sorry, has inspired a generation of the most boring music I've ever heard</p>
