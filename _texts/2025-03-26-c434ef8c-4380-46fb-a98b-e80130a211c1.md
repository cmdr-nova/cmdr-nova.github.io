<p>I just think I should point out that the owner of Melonland is in fact a douchebag. Albeit, I didn't say this to him. I was as pointed and respectful as I could be. The issue was because, in a thread about Ai, where a few people were trying to argue that it's actually fine, and a perfectly viable medium of art, I mentioned that anyone who thinks this should be shunned and mocked out of creative communities.<br><br>To which Melon himself responded with this, and then hours later hit me with some sugar on top, because, in private conversation I told him I didn't care about his moderation decision and my mind remains unchanged.<br><br>I can no longer endorse <a class="hashtag" data-tag="melondland" href="https://labyrinth.zone/tag/melondland" rel="tag ugc">#Melondland</a>, or its associated forums, and I understand how this looks, with my having *just* launched a forum of my own, but I assure you, Melon stepping up to bat for generative theft is entirely coincidental.<br><br>Double points for speaking about me telling Ai enthusiasts that they should be shunned being equated to dehumanization, as if I'm not someone who has been dehumanized for multiple decades for entirely different and actually tangible reasons.</p><img src="/assets/text_media/ed58bc881fe1010714b468bf70a5a7d0913dabfa8a708d4928425eed944c2777.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/text_media/7338914473751d8143905fab135f8b892766031d9e7aece6e1cc01ca9589b0a4.png" alt="" />
