<p>trying to get in some practice on Widowmaker, cause I haven't played this game in ages<br><br>feel like I'm a bit rusty, too afraid to jump in a match cause people hate when you play Widow and don't get kills on almost every shot lol (low quality video render so as to not have a massive video filesize on this instance)</p><img src="/assets/text_media/069dfdcb3871149b43b11f391d454134afa1cda05ac9cd616bb5c792fcb5fdf1.mp4" alt="" />
