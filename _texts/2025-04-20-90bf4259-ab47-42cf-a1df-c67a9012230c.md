<p>I have the next 3 days off (if I survive the likely extrremely busy night I'm in for here soon), and I think part of what I want to do is ...<br><br>Figure out how to find ancient cities in Minecraft? I've been digging and digging and digging and I've never ever seen The Warden, and I've never ever seen his home.<br><br>But I want pieces of that biome to decorate my base lol and I can't find it!</p>
