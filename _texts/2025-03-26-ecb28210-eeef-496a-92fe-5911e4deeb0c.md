<p>I saw someone else say it pretty well, but, ever  since corporations have started centralizing everything, controlling the conversation, and flow of data, the genuine internet began to die, and almost died out completely.<br><br>ActivityPub brought some of it back, where people can talk without fear of losing everything should a moderator end up being bigoted or what-have-you, but there's still the issue of having no real places where you can have long-term conversations, and form communities that are also open to the general public, and *searchable*, so others can find things they're interested in.<br><br>Reddit and Lemmy exist, but in these places conversations last minutes, and new content replaces everything. On Discord, it's the same issue, except with the added problem, is nobody can find anything you're talking about, *outside* of Discord. So, if you post something like, "how to debug this specific error that's also pretty common" in a Discord server, guess how easy that'll be to find: Terribly not easy at all, to impossible.<br><br>And that's where a resurgence of discussion forums come in.</p>
