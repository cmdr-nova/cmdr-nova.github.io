<p>I've been juggling the idea in my head of leaving Second Life behind. It's returned CEO wants to put AI into it. Not sure if the virtual town hall changed anything (I missed it because I have a job and I have to sleep), but aside from that, you can't meet anyone anymore, not even through an in-world app that's meant to be used to meet people lol<br><br>And IF you do, a lot of the people I meet are bitter, and talk to you like a jerk for-no-reason<br><br>I just keep thinking, "What's the value in maintaining my SL store other things I have in SL anymore?"</p>
