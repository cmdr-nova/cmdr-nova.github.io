<p>I'm on this Minecraft server and looking at another player's build, he's got massive farms, crafters, and mob farmers and I just don't understand why someone would play this way lol<br><br>Part of the game is collecting this stuff with your own hands<br><br>What are you doing if the game is playing itself for you</p>
