<p>I like the mastodon software, and being there, mostly, but I don't like how a lot of the instances not only make excuses in order to allow users to post generated slop, but some of them almost even encourage it<br><br>I'm mega anti-generative slop. I've been heckled for this, but it's a position I won't back down from. You don't scrape the work of millions of people, and then generate some kind of glossy ripoff, and tell me the sky is blue. Nah, it's puke-green<br><br>So I'm happy to continue building my home on labyrinth lol</p>
