<p>This post was linked to me, which is written by someone associated with Fosstodon, and I think I can see what the author is likely talking about in his veiled words and hidden meanings<br><br><a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama" rel="ugc">https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama</a><br><br>"The last point I'll make is this - the fedi is supposed to be a friendly, welcoming online space, right? But the fact is, it isn't. It's just like everywhere else online - the vocal minority are just as loud, and just as obnoxious as everywhere else.<br><br>I'd like to say it's been a fun 8 years, but it hasn't. I was fun for the first 3 years or so. After that, it's been pretty much shit, to varying degrees, the entire time."<br><br>This is something of a problem with "neutral" tech guys on the fediverse.<br><br>You had someone with actively fascist opinions on a mod team, and you try your damndest to maintain neutrality, which is exactly how you attract fascists.<br><br>It hasn't been fun for you?<br><br>Maybe that's because fedi isn't friendly to fascists and the people who allow them to exist. "Fedi is supposed to be a welcoming place"<br><br>Yes<br><br>For normal people.<br><br>NOT FOR NAZIS.</p>
