<p>Still to this day, I can't for the life of me remember the mods that were used on a <a class="hashtag" data-tag="minecraft" href="https://labyrinth.zone/tag/minecraft" rel="tag ugc">#Minecraft</a> server I joined way back in 2016? or 17? <br><br>I remember it added magical things to the world, like fairies and a whole other magical realm? But it wasn't like, Hairy Plopper or something.<br><br>Everything had a distinct coloring, like a lot of color to its biomes, all mostly in pastel.<br><br>It was the coolest looking mod, and I saw it exactly one time, and then never found it again. And, due to most servers being glorified MMOs rather than vanilla worlds with some quirky mods nowadays, I don't think I'll ever see it naturally, ever again</p>
