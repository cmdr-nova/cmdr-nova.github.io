<p>I'm reading about the Warden in Minecraft, trying to figure out if I should kill the thing, or leave it alone (considering I just had his darkness effect IN MY BASE ... in the overworld?!), and apparently it's a great idea to not bother killing him, and just find cool loot in the Ancient Cities<br><br>But, okay, so why did I see his darkness while I was in my base</p>
