<p>Learning that Minecraft scales the same kinda way that media hosting does on Mastodon haha<br><br>except I think a fully generated MC world to it's 30 million block border and both axis would be like 9 petabytes<br><br>But why would you do that, because it'd be virtually impossible to travel in a short span of time unless you're using mods</p>
