<p>it's that time of the week again<br><br>I don't wanna go back to work xD<br><br>I've been spending a lot of my time off just distracting myself in WoW and Minecraft from the fact that I literally cannot find anything online that I could do, for money, and for decent money, and so each week keeps going, and I keep distracting myself</p>
