<p>I log onto my Priest (in WoW) whoms't I haven't logged into since almost 9 years ago when the g/f I had at the time broke up with/ghosted me. The character I used to play with her, which we did for about 8 months.<br><br>Come to find, this Priest has like 50,000 gold just chilling in her bags haha</p>
