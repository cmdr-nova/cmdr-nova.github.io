<p>Was talking about WoW and how nobody really says anything ingame anymore unless you specifically go to trade chat lol but I was wondering, does anyone I know on fedi play an MMO or online game? Trying to have a second person to run around with?<br><br>I mean I've joined multiple guilds in WoW and found the same problem: Everyone's either not talking, or specifically only talking in Discord (I hate Discord like, about 80%)</p>
