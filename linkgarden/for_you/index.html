create input: your links <span class="blinking-cursor">â–‘</span>

<p>
have you ever wanted one of those pages that all the streamers, influencers, and onlyfans models use, but didn't really want to <i>pay</i> some greedy corporate service on a <i>monthly</i> basis, just to customize things, and ... have a background image?
</p>
<p>
look no further, you have stumbled into the linkgarden. at linkgarden, i am but one person, but i can make you the link page of your wildest dreams! your own customer colors, backgrounds, header images, avatars, gifs, featured images, videos, and even custom cursor animations. whatever you want (within reason). heck, i'll even create a neocities account <i>for you</i>, toss your page onto the server, and hand you the credentials.
</p>

<p>
    of course, i could also setup a custom domain for you, but this is a bit more involved, and can be discussed if actually desired.
</p>

<p>
    here are some examples i've setup in order to give you a basic idea of what i can do, for you:
</p>

        <image width="720" height="360" xlink:href="/img/for-you/examples.png"></image> <a xlink:href="https://mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you/examples/example1" target="_blank">
          <rect x="26" y="8" fill="#fff" opacity="0" width="217" height="349"></rect>
        </a><a xlink:href="https://mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you/examples/example2" target="_blank">
          <rect x="255" y="7" fill="#fff" opacity="0" width="217" height="350"></rect>
        </a><a xlink:href="https://mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you/examples/example3" target="_blank">
          <rect x="481" y="7" fill="#fff" opacity="0" width="222" height="350"></rect>
        </a>

    now you're probably wondering, "how much will this cost me tho? are you gonna charge me 15 dollars a month just to have this?" and the answer to that question would be, "no." in order to setup your link page, i charge a one-time flat fee of 80 dollars. calculating in the hours spent designing and coding all of this, plus the time it'll take to setup for you, and with the cost of living in mind, this is very reasonable. now, if this becomes <i>more</i> extensive, and you want more features than initially provided, we can negotiate.
</p>

<p>
    one of the main reasons i'm doing this, is because, we've entered an era of the internet where every corporation is trying to suck you dry of every penny you have, and using the most annoying and vile ways to do it, as well. everything is a subscription, everything is tracking you, everything is an algorithm. it's exhausting, and the days of the nineties internet are all but lost, or are they?

    disclaimer: i will make a page for just about <i>anyone</i>, unless you're involved in the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>ai generated theft & spam</li> : i do not support the scraping of content from artists, writers, and developers in order to make plagiarized and stolen content for a quick buck.

    <li>illegal content</li> : illegal content, such as CSAM, or extreme violence encouraging harm upon others, is not allowed here, and i will not support such things with a custom link-page.
    
    <li>exploitation content</li> : this one is related to CSAM, but if you make content online by exploiting your children in any way, and in a way that they cannot consent, i am not interested in making a page for you.

    <li>hate content</li> : any content made to express, expose, or instigate hate against others based on their gender, race, or sexuality, is not content i will build a page for.

  </ul> 

  <p>
    if any of these things describe you, you would be better off paying linktree on a monthly basis.
  </p>

  <p>
    further disclaimer notes: i am not responsible for the misuse of these linkpages. i build them, and hand them off (unless otherwise specified through my premium package). linkpages, or linkgardens, used in a way that harm others, or encourage so, is not the intent of their original creator. you may <i>not</i> feed a linkgarden into an "ai" bot, or use ai in order to misrepresent what i have made for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    thank you for respecting my wishes.
