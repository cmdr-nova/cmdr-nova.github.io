It was 2020, my rotation of mobile games included just two of them. I had a phone that could support ... maybe three? One of them was the already very well-known Orc game, and the other was a little gacha called Illusion Connect. Okay, so, if you aren't really interested in gachas, and you think buying stuff in them sucks, this probably isn't all that interesting to you.

But, today it was revealed, that almost two years after it's closure, Illusion Connect is returning this winter.

This was my *main* mobile game for a long time. The thing is, like with most mobile games, I stop playing them for a while, and then I come back and continue. It's a pattern with me, and not really any inherent issue with mobile games in-general. I treat triple-a desktop games exactly the same way. I'm super into Warframe, but I haven't opened it in two weeks, because I just ... have so much going on in my brain-juice.

So I had that little cooling off period, and after a while, I decided I wanted to open it up again and see how things were going. And then in December, 2022, it abruptly shutdown. Leaving you with nothing but an error screen as if it still exists, it just couldn't connect to the servers.

Since then, I've been kind of meandering through these other gacha games that don't really capture the same thing, or the same fun I had in my little phone game of anime girls. Albeit, Genshin, ZZZ, Wuthering Waves are all *great*. There's just ... something *also* good about a game that isn't trying to be a huge open-world mega gacha experience. And that's what Illusion Connect was. A simple thing you logged into, tapped some objectives, collected your stuff, pulled, and then logged off.

I like mobile games like that. Something I can open secretly while I'm walking through the halls at work, click a box, watch it open, and then shove my phone back into my pants.

But *anyway*, <a href="https://www.taptap.cn/moment/582294702590525813" target="_blank">here's the announcement</a>.

For those who can't read Chinese, (like me), here's the translation:

Suffice to say, the developers have apparently been rebuilding the game, and that's cool! It's *cool* when an online game of sorts isn't just *abandoned*, and instead worked on, rebuilt, and then relaunched, even *after* an unfortunate closure. A lot of big studios should take notes here ... 

Still mad I bought into The Matrix Online two decades ago in order to lose all my stuff, and my character, *forever*.
