Also now you can buy both of my previous tattoos in one applier and on one layer!<br />
<br />
Not only is this the cheapest deal, if you of course want to wear both, but also removes the hassle of masking and mixing layers!<br />
<br />
Next up I will likely do leg tattoos, or maybe even a butt today (lol).<br />
<br />
As soon as TMP responds to my request, I'll also being doing what I called "bloody frosted" lipstick. But, you know, it's a waiting game.<br />
