It's becoming kind of a trend, that I make something in my Second Life store, and then drop the whole thing for two to three months while I work on a million other things. Despite all of that, today I decided to put together another pair of shorts for the set I've been putting together for ... a while. Today, it's juicy green shorts!

This is the second to last pair of shorts in the *Nano Nexus* set, and then I move on to ... some other piece of clothing! And hopefully end up releasing it in a standard amount of time that is absolutely not equal to an *entire year*.

You can view them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-Juicy-Edition/26578153" target="_blank">digital marketplace</a>, or come and see them <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">in-world at the store</a> itself.

Speaking of *millions of other things* I work on, in unrelated news, I put together an RSS feed element for my website that reads my Bluesky feed, and then slapped it onto Github for others to check out and potentially use. You can see that <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/bsky-feed" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, it grabs the RSS feed of your profile (on Bluesky), bounces it off of a proxy so that it doesn't spit out a ton of CORS errors, and then displays your most recent three posts. And, it updates with each page refresh!

Easy peasy.

I've also made it so new posts from this website *also* go to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cmdr-nova.bsky.social" target="_blank">my Bluesky account</a>, and since I haven't really tested it yet, this post *should hopefully* get there safely. We'll see.

But, until my next release, or hacked code update, or random thought, have a good one.
