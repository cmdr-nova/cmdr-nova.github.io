So, I decided I wanted to write about albums I buy on Bandcamp, partly because when I was still being extremely, over-the-top prolific about making music back on Twitter (before the twitter-synthwave community effectively excommunicated me due to a large portion of them being extremely bigoted), some didn't think I was buying any music. They thought I was simply releasing music and ignoring everything else.

Well, this is on-going and continuing proof that I do buy, and also listen to music. Especially nowadays, as my album creation process is *much, much slower* than it used to be.

Up first! We have ...

*Whitewoods*, <a href="https://mypetflamingo.bandcamp.com/album/spaceship-earth" target="_blank">Spaceship Earth</a>. I grabbed this album, because it sounded like a mixture of new wave pop-punk and synth-y vaporwave, which, I think, is *exactly what it is*.

Next up is, *t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者 and 猫シ Corp.*, <a href="https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/--45" target="_blank">テ​レ​パ​シ​ー​の</a>. Which is, for all intents and purposes, a *much more* traditional type of vaporwave. You've gotta have the traditional type, along with its variations. At least, *once*, in your Bandcamp shopping sprees.

I support vaporwave a lot more nowadays, because it sounds exactly like something you might hear while you're lost in the Complex / Backrooms.

Third in today's purchases, is *LAST CEREMONY*, <a href="https://businesscasual87.bandcamp.com/album/dial-up-daydreams" target="_blank">DIAL-UP-DAYDREAMS</a>. This is some more mega-vapor tunes, with a call-back to nineties internet surfing. Basically, all you need to do in order to get me to buy your album, is to theme it around 90s internet. That's it!

Fourth, is *glaciære*, with <a href="https://hiraeth-records.bandcamp.com/album/pool-water-blue" target="_blank">pool water blue</a>. A very *dreamy*, vaporwave, kind of liminal space sounding album, with definite eighties synthwave influences mixed within. Listening to this, only a few tracks in, it's a *must buy*.

I don't really buy anything that's purely "eighties synthwave" much anymore, mostly due-in-part to the way a lot of the people in that music community treated me. But, I do still listen to and enjoy its influences.

And, *finally*, what would a Bandcamp shopping spree be if I didn't buy, *Mabisyo*, with <a href="https://mabisyo.bandcamp.com/album/sun-colored-eyes" target="_blank">Sun Colored Eyes</a>. This is the second Mabisyo album I've grabbed, and, just like the first time, this is *professional grade* dreamy vapor-synth. And, while a lot of these albums have obvious influences from Japan, and its music (think lo-fi j-pop), this is definitely one of the most notable.

That's it for now! I could probably go on an infinite shopping spree and just grab *every single thing* that catches my eye, but my bank account wouldn't like that much. So, we'll save the next 5 albums I buy for either my next payday, or next month. Or, maybe May's Bandcamp Friday? We'll see!
