Brand new in the "body mods" section of the REVOSA store, elven ears!<br />
<br />
These ears are handcrafted 100% original mesh. The pack comes with a regular version and 3 version that include separately pierced ears and then a version with both ears pierced. Product also includes a color picker HUD in order to help match your skin, although the product is copy/mod so it may be resized, moved and even retextured if you please.<br />
