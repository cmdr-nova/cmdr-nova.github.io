So, the past couple years have been pretty much just a non-stop horror show, as each platform and app you use goes head-first into slop factory hype, and integrates some needless AI feature that violates your consent. I personally feel we mostly have out-of-touch CEOs and investors to blame for this, but I like to think a company can also just say, "No," whenever they want (prove me right). Today is no different, and this time it's SoundCloud.

Via <a href="https://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#changes-to-terms-of-use" target="_blank">SoundCloud's updated Terms of Service</a>, and, you *should* be reading these things from anything you sign up for in 2025, they now specify that your work can be used to train and inform "artificial intelligence."

Great!

More ways to remove income and livelihood from artists and funnel money into the pockets of greedy shitheads who've never had a creative thought in their lives.

<blockquote>

As a courtesy to providing you a platform to be spammed by bots and have the company beg you to pay them to upload *more* of your music, they'll be taking that music for slop training, as well. Enjoy!

I think not.

I've deleted my account, and you should too.

Sooner, rather than later, the only websites I use for any of my work are going to be *this* website, and my account on Akkoma or Wafrn. Maybe that's what these rich pieces of garbage want. They want everyone on the fringes, and they *want* chatbots to advertise to each other, endlessly. 

I mean, I guess maybe there's also Bluesky, but I've got nothing but questionable and bad experiences with that site, and let's not forget that their money is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blockchaincapital.com/post/3l7biuedaop2g" target="_blank">controlled by crypto bros</a>.

I can't wait to wake up tomorrow and find out which way another company my words or work live on have decided to waste precious drinking water for brain-dead prompts by people who are addicted to a 15 second serotonin buzz.
