So, the past couple years have been pretty much just a non-stop horror show, as each platform and app you use goes head-first into slop factory hype, and integrates some needless AI feature that violates your consent. I personally feel we mostly have out-of-touch CEOs and investors to blame for this, but I like to think a company can also just say, "No," whenever they want (prove me right). Today is no different, and this time it's SoundCloud.

Via <a href="" target="_blank">SoundCloud's updated Terms of Service</a>, and, you *should* be reading these things from anything you sign up for in 2025, they now specify that your work can be used to train and inform "artificial intelligence."

Great!

More ways to remove income and livelihood from artists and funnel money into the pockets of greedy shitheads who've never had a creative thought in their lives.
