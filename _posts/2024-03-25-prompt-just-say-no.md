<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>How often do you say “no” to things that would interfere with your goals?</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is kind of an ambiguous question, at least for me, because I have a lot of goals. But by and large, most of my goals have to do with either learning new things, doing creative work in my free time, and advancing <em>at</em> work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past four years I’ve always said “No” to things that got in the way of my … work goals. I’ve achieved a lot in that respect, and it’s definitely something to feel proud about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sad part is, I’ve always viewed my day job as a buffer in between what I actually want to do. I want to be one of those online creators, and for a while I was, and I was gaining steam. But life got in the way along with a myriad of other things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It isn’t that I feel like I’m getting too old for it, because, for all intents and purposes, age doesn’t stop anyone from making a job out of creating online and turning that into a career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s stopping me, is that I always say “No” to the things that might drive me closer to this particular goal. I say it because I’m tired, because I’m too exhausted, because I want to game, or spend my time outside of work relaxing and hanging out in Second Life. And it’s because of that, that I have a book I haven’t written for in months, a Second Life store I haven’t made anything for in an even longer period of time, a music career that hasn’t seen movement since I released an album months ago, and a “YouTuber” idea I have that I haven’t even remotely started yet. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe this prompt was good, because I needed a reminder as to what my actual goal is. The real question is, can I stop saying “No?” I used to do what I wanted to do with my creative work whether I was tired or not, but over time that feeling of fatigue has only increased, and I worry it’s made me complacent in a state of non-movement.</p>

<p>That’s the real issue: Complacency. </p>
