It's a pretty widely known fact, at this point, that the development and continued use of AI is <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about" target="_blank">killing the planet</a>. It's killing the planet at an even more accelerated rate than the world's richest people and their corporations were, already. And yet, you can log onto Twitter (if you dare), Threads, Bluesky, and even Mastodon, and see tech-hype-brained, uncritical idiots (for lack of a better term), celebrating the thought of the expansion of LLMs to the point where we're now apparently even talking of wasting the potential of Linux-based operating systems on our phones, on its continued development and use.

"Who made *you* the arbiter of what people do with their own hardware?!" An apologist of planet-crushing autocorrect, might ask.

To which I say, "Me, asshole. Just me."

When I moved to Linux, it was partially because of Microsoft and their bad decisions in regard to booting anyone with slightly out-of-date processors to the curb (welcome to Windows 10, say goodbye to security updates). The other half of it, was the eventual announcement of their "AI powered" <a href="/linux/2024/11/11/ten-months-without-windows.html">privacy invasion software</a>, labeled "Recall." You know, along with the ads, the popups, and the *other* AI garbage, embedded directly into your desktop.

I moved to Linux, because, you can do pretty much whatever you want with the software, and it is *extremely secure*, and privacy focused.

Unfortunately, people with no imagination, and no respect for themselves, the environment, or the Linux operating system, have decided that "anything" can also mean, developing and/or using water-guzzling, ice-cap melting, plagiarism machines.

And when I think of Linux, but on a phone, I think: Security, privacy, endless customization, and how cool it would be if we still had snow on Christmas in Pennsylvania.

When these fartbags think of Linux, but on a phone, they think: Of how great it would be if the entire human population were wiped out by 2042.

As an iPhone user, I've already had AI shoved in my face--Just as much as I have in using Microsoft products that I'm forced to interface with at my job, or the endless droves of creatively bankrupt drones on corporate social media who post slop, ad infinitum, and for the pleasure of no one but themselves.

And maybe you're thinking, "Pfft, so you're almost 40, I bet you're just yelling angrily at a cloud, afraid to embrace new things!"

No, see. *I have used AI,* and even *without* the extreme environmental impact, it sucks nards and ass.

<img src="/img/posts/nosnow/Screenshot from 2025-01-26 17-12-33.png">

AI has a massive propensity to simply *guess* things if it doesn't immediately know the answer. Which, in the least, is a bunch of crap. You mean to tell me you think Jupiter is closer to Saturn than it is to Earth? Are you serious?

And, at worst, it's an efficient propaganda machine that could easily fuel misinformation campaigns.

These trillion dollar companies have scraped the entire internet, and the creativity of real human beings, in order to ... *give you incorrect information*.

And yet, these tech bros will talk to you and say things like, "It's inevitable dude, may as well jump on board!"

<img src="/img/posts/nosnow/Screenshot from 2025-01-26 04-27-03.png">

Yeah, AI is inevitable. Inevitable to either aid and abet Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg in killing everyone on the planet, or popping like a saturated bubble in the same way NFTs did.

Either way, if you're using Linux to interface with a plagiarism bot, please just go back to Windows. Windows was *built for you*. You can revel in your contribution to the destruction of our home *without* tainting the Linux operating system for something you're going to be embarrassed about if you happen to live long enough to retire.
