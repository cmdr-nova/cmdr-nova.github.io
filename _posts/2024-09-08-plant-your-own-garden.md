Today, I spent the equivalent of around ten hours of work (on my day off, no less), designing and developing a new kind of "side service" I wanted to offer to people who: Don't have the time, or don't *want* to learn HTML and CSS, and who want to separate themselves from corporate media, *just a little bit*, even if it's just to stop paying services like Linktree a monthly fee.

So, today I am unveiling, <a href="/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">LinkGarden</a>.

Plant your own garden ... of links!

I detail the service on the page, but I'll write about it here, as well, except, maybe in a more extended fashion. I'm offering this for twenty bucks. You pay me, then contact me, and I'll get your page together, and even make you a Neocities where it can be hosted (hosted, completely for free). Of course, once I hand over the credentials, you'll be responsible for changing your password. But, that's a given!

You *can* request to use a custom domain, but this is a little more involved, in that, we'll need to figure out if you're buying the domain, and if you *know* how to setup the DNS. If not, I certainly know how to do this, but I *also* don't have access to your domain admin panels.

I'm doing this, though, because, I want to show people that they can have all the frills of a Linktree, *without* a Linktree. I can do it for you, easy-peasy, and in about an hour.

Now, obviously, if you want *really* extensive, or more complicated stuff (more javascript, animated buttons that do more than just click and highlight, and so on and so forth), that would obviously take *more than an hour* to setup. Then, yes, we'll have to negotiate pricing a little bit (right now my day job takes up so much of my time it's ridiculous). Consider this though, if you currently pay monthly for a Linktree, or some other such service, and you've been doing so for a long time, how much have you paid them, in total? Probably less than what it'd cost for me to do this for you, right?

But I'm also doing this, because *you should* own your own piece of the internet. A place where a bunch of suits *aren't* tracking your every move, where people can come and see what you're all about, quickly, and easily. Maybe sometime in the future I'll offer to build people entire websites! But, I don't think that's a venture I want to spend another ten hours preparing right now (I have some people in VR I want to visit tonight).

Once you have the page, and access to it, if you decide you want things changed, I can *also* do that. But, I *would* encourage buyers to look into the code used to build their link pages, and see if you can fiddle with changing things yourself (learning is fun!). I have them all setup with the simplest CSS and HTML possible, and if you use a program like VS Code, switching colors around in a CSS file is *even easier*. And, if you mess things up, I will have a backup of everything I do right here on my PC.

So, come on over, *and plant your own garden*.
