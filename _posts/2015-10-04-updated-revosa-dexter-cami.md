After finishing the last two products that I made today, I remembered that I had an old system layer camisole on my marketplace store, something I'd made way, way back when I started REVOSA (6 months ago).<br />
<br />
So with my current ability, I took that cami and updated it with a Maitreya applier HUD, and now it is once again a viable purchase! (lol)<br />
<br />
I think this may be the last old product that I update, although there was one other shirt, which was my very first product, before I even had a Second Life business... but we'll see about that.<br />
