Much like last month, [REVOSA] (my Second Life store), is once again appearing in the Progeny Mall shopping event! This time, for the month of October--the spookiest time of the year! Because my free time is scattered and all over the place, for now, I'm simply discounting a recent, but slightly older item. But! For the first time ever, not only is [REVOSA] part of this event, but so is Ayashi Systems, or *AyaSys*, my secondary store.

Come on down to the <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Progeny/172/116/21" target="_blank">Progeny Mall</a> and check them both out.

Alternatively, if you'd like to visit my store instead, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">come on over</a> and see the updated location!

Either way, thank you for joining me in the continued revival of activity within my Second Life store, even as my offline job saps all the energy out of me.
