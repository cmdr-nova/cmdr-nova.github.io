You may remember the hosted version of mkultra.monster, wherein I wasn't initially blocking Threads (I'm very much not a bandwagon type of person). I thought it was kind of neat that a *billion dollar platform* was attempting to interface with ActivityPub, and it seemed to *at least* be at odds with Twitter. And, you know, I know a handful of people on Threads who are cool. But, like with many things, my opinions change. After relaunching <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a> on a self hosted droplet over at Digital Ocean, not only did this *accidentally* send a signal to Meta that I no longer exist, but they're *on my instance blocklist, anyway*. Why? It's no longer anywhere remotely *near* an okay idea.

Mark Zuckerberg, as of writing this, is functionally *no different* than the man who destroyed and continues to destroy Twitter. Musk is the reason most of us are on Mastodon, Threads, and Bluesky, and Threads was, or at least I perceived it to *be*, a response to the destruction of Twitter.

Lo and behold, Mark has decided to mirror the inclinations and ideologies of Lemon almost to a T, with absolutely zero foresight, or *common sense.*

But, he is a libertarian.

See, when I was in my early twenties, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I thought of myself this way, because I had some messed up ideas about money, and how I thought society should be. Everything else was of no consequence to me, *at the time*.

But, as I got older, and older I got, I kind of started to drift into left field.

Working paycheck-to-paycheck jobs, being unable to *ever* buy a home, and possibly *never retire* will do that to a mfer.

I moved past my initial political leanings, because I learned things. I met people. I put myself into places where I could meet, speak, and enjoy people who *weren't* a carbon copy of myself.

The problem, though, is that a billionaire can't do that. Having billions of dollars breaks your brain ... *literally*. It's like what happens to a supervillain when they discover infinite power.

Nothing actually matters.

Because, *you can control what matters*.

What's the point in having strong political ideas, standards, and integrity, when you can buy your way out of any situation? When you can *buy anyone, and their loyalty, at any price*?

So why should Zuckerberg *care* if inserting himself into the far right destroys his integrity, and public perception of him being at least 2% better than Sweaty Rat?

That's just it.

When you have the power to launch a third social platform with no outside funding, *it doesn't matter what you do*.

So, enter; A man whose playthings are the lives of the people who populate his social marketplaces. And yes, I said, "marketplaces." You *are*, after-all, the *product* on corporate social media. And now those lives are turned into a grifted campaign of artificial "intelligence" vacuuming, that puts your face, and my face, and John's face, and Mary's face, and your cat's face into a database of sludge, *because he CAN!*

And now he seeks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/03/trump-administration-mark-zuckerberg" target="_blank">government appointment</a>, to further this insanity of the destruction of authenticity, and probably likely also the planet.

You should *run* from corporate social media. *Run, as fast as you can*.

I understand not wanting to delete accounts. I keep mine in most places, and I hate the feeling of loss, and uncertainty. But, you should *start* to be elsewhere. Even if "starting" is on Bluesky, which is in danger of enshitification. Having been funded by a blockchain company, and having timelines filled with people doing almost nothing but shit-flinging constantly, day and night.

And all of this *might* bring up the question in your mind, "Damn, why even bother with social media anymore? Why don't I just disconnect and never participate again?"

Go ahead.

Try.

Most of us will never escape it. Most of us will never leave, even if we hang on by the last threads of ActivityPub's tendrils, because *we are a social species, and nobody talks in-person anymore*.

Anyway, that's why I'm blocking Threads from my Mastodon instance.
