I've written about Dexter before. The lackluster ending to the original series, and the only *very slightly* better, but still lackluster ending to the redo in New Blood that the writer's attempted. Gonna go full-on spoilers here: The OG series was *fine*, even after the fourth season, until the writers killed off Deb with a blood clot. The OG series was *fine*, until they had Dexter ride off into a hurricane, and then reappear as a lumberjack in upstate New York.

New Blood was *awesome* ... until they had his son shoot him in the chest with a hunting rifle and leave him to die in the woods, driving off into Manhattan while the credits rolled.

It was artistic. I get it, I got it.

But, up until Original Sin started airing, I've always wondered, "Do the writers actually *know* what the viewers want to see? Are they just spit-balling ideas where Dexter is never known as the serial killer he is, for shits and giggles?"

The thing is, though, is that while Dexter *should* see the justice system, and that his old cop friends from Miami *should* find out what he was *really* doing ... in this day and age, it's really hard to sell it to an audience, that a guy who killed murderers, rapists, and pedophiles, that he was *somehow* a *bad* guy. The world is a *much different place* than it was in 2008.

But ... the act of putting his real identity in front of people he knew for years, was something that *should have been done* in the original series. It's *what everyone was waiting for*.

It would have been akin to the moment in Breaking Bad that his entire family finds out what Walter's been doing with his free time.

It's that *mask-off* moment that really would have made the show. But the writer's didn't do that. For some reason ... they didn't *want* to do that. They *wanted* him to get away, and keep going. And, I think, that's also probably mostly what the audience *also* wanted. But, his identity as a killer of killers *cannot*, in a fictional 21st century, feasibly *remain* a secret. And it was exactly what should have happened, shortly after his sister found out that he was murdering people.

I don't want to say that the show jumped the shark, because it's still *a pretty good show*, especially in its freshman years.

Flash-forward and its 2025, the whole entire world has pretty much forgotten about Dexter and the two times they did the ending to his story, and somehow also just didn't get it right. Both times.

Now, here we are, watching a narrated long-cut flashback sequence of his life as a 20 year old (or 19?) in the 90s just as he's hired by Miami Metro.

I didn't think it was a good idea, at first. I thought, "This is gonna be pointless. We already know everything that happens." But, as a matter of fact, you **don't** know everything that happens.

Aside from the fact that Original Sin starts with a flash-forward of Dexter surviving the gun shot from New Blood, it opens up a plethora of *brand new things* you've never seen before. Gun fights, screw-ups, relationships, and ... Dexter *literally* taping the captain of the homicide unit to a kill table.

And it's all done in a way that *actually* and *finally* feels like the writers have *figured it out*. Like the light-bulb flashed on in their heads, and they went, "Oh hey, you know what? I just realized what we should be doing with this character and this story." And then they did it.

Now, I'm not saying Dexter's identity is revealed to anyone in the prequel series. That wouldn't make sense. But I think I can see where this is finally going. I mean, you got a *tease* of it at the end of New Blood, and then no resolution *whatsoever*, because they tentatively *killed Dexter off*. 

But, after watching through 9 episodes out of 10 of Original Sin, so far, I think it was a good idea to go, "No, wait. He isn't dead."

Here's hoping they get the ending right, this time.

As far as their plans to release a Trinity Killer side-series ... uh, you know, I'm not really sure we need that. But hey, whatever floats the writer's boats at this point.
