<p>Brand new at [REVOSA] (my Second Life store), and after quite a bit of time, the Nano Nexus line of shorts has received a "void" edition! Like previous shorts, this is fit for legacy, reborn, and maitreya, and is colored in ALL BLACK!</p>

<p>It has been quite some time since I've released anything, and my store over-all has had a much slower drip feed of products. This is partially due to my working offline in a job, but also partially due to me previously running a whole entire sim for over a year. Now that Neo Machina is tentatively closed for now, and possibly the foreseeable future, I have some more time to just focus on my store and it's products.</p>

<p>As a place that's been standing since 2015, it's only right to keep it going.</p>

<p>Come see the new shorts <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Enzo/164/160/3008">in-world</a>, and have a gander around the place, maybe grab some free stuff, a drink, and a hotdog!</p>
