A while back I had a real shoddy, and not-so-well integrated search function on my website. It kinda sucked. The text bled off of the page, there was no pagination, and the result querying was live, which also didn't look good. I've been working on a lot of things on my website, today, though. Including making the design more "fixed" so that posts and their summaries don't expand into the infinite universe, and also, a brand new full search function.

If you look up to the top right (on desktop), you'll see in the secondary sidebar there's now a search field. Since I have very *many* posts on this site, and there's only going to be more, *now* you can just type in something interesting, like "linux," and you'll get everything I've ever written on here that includes the phrase.

Genius!

It actually works kind of in the same way my "poast to mastodon" script works, for when I publish new posts, except it's not posting to Mastodon, and it is instead generating URLs for search results regarding *every single post* on this site, each time I build and serve, locally.

Now, it's not as robust and broken, and also horrible as Google. There's no AI interrupting to give you weird hallucinated interruptions. Just pure ... uh, text written by me.

Whoop whoop.
