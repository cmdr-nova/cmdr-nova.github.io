I haven't written anything on here in a few days, not since I wrote up nine guides for budding web developers, and then promptly returned to work to be exhausted and run through the grinder of the grind. And, with one day left til my "weekend," I got a little bit more to go. But I don't really like to talk about my offline job in social places online. I mean, it's my job. Yes, some day I would either like to promote upward until I don't have to worry about anything anymore, *or* find a career in web development, but that's besides the point.

I just get tired.

And it's hard to think.

Yeah, it's tax time. Worst time of the year, when single people with lots of bills and a day job get pennies back from the IRS, and then charges from the local bureau because fuck you, that's why.

I find a lot of the time, if I don't stop to write, and if I don't stop to think about the things around me, and how life's going, I tend to ... *lose* myself. I lose track of where I am and where I'm headed. I get stuck in a brain-fog where I feel like I'm an outsider watching myself move through the motions of the everyday monotony. Some people might call that, uh, dissociation. 

Not sure why I'd be dissociating, but hey, whatever.

Here's a picture of my cat.

Today I was thinking to myself, "I can use my time while I'm at work to low-key try to think of ideas on how I can use my website to turn out some kind of income." But then I got distracted by being at work, and by being busy, and I came up with no ideas on how to do that. And, no, I am not going to start stuffing ad-sense into this site.

I don't want Google's haphazard ad-malware painted all over this castle of web design that I've spent almost a year building. It'd be like putting brussels sprouts on pizza. Why the hell would you do that?

Anyway, my neck hurts. These are my night-time thoughts for the third of February.
