I've been having this issue since I started going hard on developing this website into something that's strange, or interesting, or maybe even *fun* to visit. I've embedded a small little box to the right where you can leave messages, I made a todo list that details what I plan to do next in regards to the website, I have another box to the right that shows a live feed of my posts over on Mastodon, and I even put a little radio underneath all that which plays the ambient drone sound from the now *closed* city I built in Second Life.

But the issue I've been having, is that I just take *way too long* thinking of something to write about. And then, here in the twilight hours of Saturday night, August 24th, I realized what my problem is.

I like to surf the old Geocities pages. Pretend I'm still like 11 or something, and read what people used to say to themselves on their pages. And that's just it. That's what people were doing. They were just ... saying things. Like they were on some kind of long-form Twitter. Stuff like ...

>Hi guys, I put this website up today to showcase my favorite show the X-Files, also I had a cheeseburger earlier and man was it tasty. Also did you notice Yahoo has an iframe now?

And it's just *like that*, the whole time. People aren't really thinking about these massive posts that they're sure people will want to read. Nah, screw that. *It doesn't matter.*

The ethos of people, heck, even *me* in the 90s, were to ***just write stuff and don't worry about it.***

That's the problem.

So anyway, have you guys *actually watched* Kane Pixels' rendition of The Backrooms? Amidst all the over-the-top, and downright *silly* imaginings some people post about in a growing Wiki of ... whatever, *this is the real shit*.

Pretty terrifying right?

Yeah, this is the inspiration for my next album, and you can check all that out if you click that little wormhole to the left (but be warned, the music plays automatically). But, I just really wanted to kind of highlight this.

Because this stuff is made *by a teenager*. Someone with skill that far outclasses my own in Blender and sound design, and I'm 39 years old, still learning, still working upward. And then I see this and it's *amazing*. I think I've watched through the entire Youtube series of videos for Kane's Backrooms about three or four times now.

I'm *completely* sold on whatever A24 and Kane come up with for a feature-length film involving ... *all of this*.

Speaking of feature length films involving fandoms, horror, and sometimes games, I'm also waiting very patiently on **this**.

Based on the indie hit game *Iron Lung*, by a Youtuber I've really just barely watched over the past decade. But *this* is really something.

The horror genre is about to be stomped into the dust with a new genre of film. While studios are remaking Halloween 47 times, we've got two Youtubers stretching the bounds of imagination with things Hollywood couldn't even remotely *dream* of.

I only hope that both Backrooms and Iron Lung are successes so that this continues.
