Today I decided to consolidate my website to *just one place*, i.e., the place where it originates, and is built each time: Github. I'm mostly doing this because I've allowed some of my bills to get out of control, and I'm paying for things I really don't need to be. After using Neocities for a *long time*, I've found the social aspect isn't really ... worth it. People don't really pay any attention to website feeds on there. And, even *with* the allowed 50 gigs of space on Neocities, you're *still limited to the suggested 1 gig limit on Github*.

So, I figured, "Why don't I just keep this on Github and stop having my website in two separate places???" And hence, I did.

But, I'm mostly writing this post right now to see if my "post to mastodon" script works, *without* the deploy-to-neocities step in the workflow (which it should). I'll only know though, once I hit that commit button.

As Picard would say, Engage.
