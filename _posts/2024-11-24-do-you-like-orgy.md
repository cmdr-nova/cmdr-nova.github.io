In continuing a trend of visiting teenage me from 1999 and onward, I'm revisiting one of my favorite bands. *Of course*, I was into Korn, and Nine Inch Nails, and Sonic Mayhem, and TOOL, but then there was Orgy. And in that respect, I'm no longer afraid to say that I had a *huge* crush on Jay Gordon, and I was also a *very confused* teenager. Hell, I'm STILL confused!

Keeping on-track with early-aged awakenings, I offer up this (I'm aware Marilyn Manson went down a path that sucks later in his career, and is guilty of some pretty heinous things, but we're talking about 1999 for the moment):

Does this make you feel uncomfortable? No? It didn't make me feel uncomfortable when I was 15, but that's how it was designed.

I have a deep connection to music in my life, and there were times that I abandoned it. *Multiple times*. 

But nearly everything I was obsessed with as as kid, a teenager, all have these emotional ties to them, things that took me years to understand ... *decades*. 

And I want to double-back to Orgy, because the band really doesn't get enough credit. They're, what you would probably call, *criminally underrated*. And they *don't have enough* albums. But that's okay! Because they were touring as early as this year! So there's hope!

I've kind of lost the plot of why I was writing this post, aside from the fact that I remembered I had a crush on Jay Gordon in 1999, and also Marilyn Manson (who, I probably won't mention again outside of this post).

Uh, have a pizza?
