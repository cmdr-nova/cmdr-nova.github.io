I, regrettably, have to talk about this by quoting from The Verge, but a couple of hours ago <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254042/mark-zuckerberg-creators-value-ai-meta" target="_blank">they published</a> a talk with the Zuck on Meta's AI, and the training data associated with it. To say that I'm a bit pissed off is an understatement.

So, let's get straight to the vomit from the horse's mouth:

>“I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content in the grand scheme of this,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, which coincides with Meta’s annual Connect event. “My guess is that there are going to be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable.” But if creators are concerned or object, “when push comes to shove, if they demanded that we don’t use their content, then we just wouldn’t use their content. It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.”

From this point forward, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a> will be suspending any and all interaction with Threads.net. I won't tell others what to do, but I've been teetering on this decision for a while. There are cool and decent people on Threads, but it's just not worth it.

A billionaire thinks all of your thoughts, your memories, your written and graphical work and design ... *isn't worth shit.*

But, it must be worth a hell of a lot if you're feeding it into your sludge machine so that you can generate some glossy garbage that sucks ass, am I wrong?

Either way, I'm going to do what I should've done months ago, and I'm gonna Zuck the Zuck.

Go to hell, Meta.

"It's not like that's going to change the outcome of this stuff that much." Are the words of a man giving every writer, developer, creator, and artist a big, bold middle finger.

Those are all the words I have to give right now, and it's exactly the right amount.
