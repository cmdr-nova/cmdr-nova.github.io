I've had a little bit of time off of work now, and aside from the script I made that updates dynamically with your name and avatar image on Mastodon, I decided it was time for my website to have a light mode toggle. And ... now it does!

You'll notice, if you're on desktop, the toggle switch is up at the top left. If you're reading this on mobile, the toggle will be at the top of the main page (outside of posts, and pages you've navigated to). Now, if you feel like you don't want to be saturated in darkness, you can switch on *bone-meal mode*. Which, despite disliking most light mode settings on websites, is *actually* pretty easy on the eyes, due to it not being full-blown, eye-bleaching white.

This is more reminiscent of a forum I used to visit as a 15 year old in high school, by the name of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020324043350/http://animeboards.com/" target="_blank">animeboards.com</a>. A website that I have *fond* and also *bad* memories of (my first interaction with online trolls happened here). This also reminds me that I'd *love* to setup an old school style PHPBB forum ... but I don't know how I would get people to join, *of if they'd even want to.*

Anyway, you can grab the associated scripts to make this work for yourself, on your *own* website, <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/light_mode_toggle" target="_blank">here</a>, on my Github.
