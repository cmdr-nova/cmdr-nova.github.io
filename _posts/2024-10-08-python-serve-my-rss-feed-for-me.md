While the dunces in the room are using AI to paint pictures for them, and make one-bar songs, I'm making little worker bee-bots that aren't AI at all, but act more like little tiny butlers for me. Butlers that live inside Debian 12 on a VPS.

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Man, why do I have to copy/paste blog post links and then also post them? I have more important things to do, like jorkin it in the club, you know, with my peanuts."

Well, friend, you are in luck today.

Meet <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/blog-poster" target="_blank">Blog-Poster</a>. He'll dig into your RSS feed, post whatever's new straight to Mastodon, and then archive it in a permanent ignore list, just so he's sure never to mistake something that's old, for something new.

Amazing.

Of course, you can give him a new name, like "Barry" or "Fart Face." It doesn't matter to me!

I still have lots to learn, and I'm starting to retain more and more as I do this, but I realize that programming is a very large and long road. Heck. I've been screwing with HTML since about 1999, and I still have to keep Google open to reference CSS modules and what-not. Plus, I'm getting older, and stuff just slips out of my brain juice and then it's gone with the wind.

Either way, that's all I have to write about for now, cause tomorrow's my day off from my offline job, and I'm about to chill, and do nothing. Or make a 4th bot. I dunno yet.
