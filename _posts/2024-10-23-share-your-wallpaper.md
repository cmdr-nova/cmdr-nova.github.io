I've been sitting here listening to Spotify most of the evening, browsing the social fediverse, and kind of thinking about things to write on this blog. Mostly because, I want to keep writing something almost every single day. You know, personal goals and such. And then I remembered old-school forum banter, and forums in-general. I'm currently a member of a few, but I rarely ever post. I guess new age social media has kind of taken my attention away from such things, unfortunately, but do you remember things like, sharing your wallpapers on a weekly basis? People just snapping photos of their desktops and being like, "Check it out dude." Peppridge Farm remembers.

Not that anyone can really *share* anything on my personal site, but I wanted to get back into the tradition of things I used to do online, that I thought was really interesting and cool. Sharing my frikken' wallpaper.

I think about old forums, how I'd log on in the middle of class at tech while my teacher was trying to ... teach me visual basic, and I'd just refresh, refresh, refresh. Kind of like how I refresh my timeline on social media sites nowadays, except I'm not sure what I was looking for back then. People responding to my posts, interesting things to reply to, friendships to make? Do we still make *friends* online, or are our followers an extension of acquaintanceship?

I've thought about using part of the server I have rented over at Digital Ocean to slap down some roots for a modern forum, but would anyone even join? I know the Discourse software is pretty neat, and good, and I'd *love* to set it up, customize it, make it look neat, maybe even start up some kind of themed email list.

But, I feel like a lot of people have either forgotten forums, or the idea of it is so far away and in the past, that some may *not even know* what the heck I'm talking about. 

"What do you *mean* post static messages on a board that isn't constantly flooding me with information overload, and engagement bait?"

Then again, I guess Reddit is sort of a never-ending forum? Message board? Except it's got random people on it that like to fight with you so that they can feel superior, for, ... you know, reasons?

I don't know. I think back to the early 90s and how my Dad used to dial-in to bulletin boards to talk to people, and I get the feeling this is one of those lost "arts" of the internet that would be really hard to bring back, en masse. So many people posting on things like Tik Tok, which, I can never get used to. What do you mean you gotta share videos of yourself and be perceived at all times in order to participate? Have any of you ever heard of being introverted? Or just, writing text? 

Maybe it would be neat to make a new forum, even if it's *just for me*.

And maybe I'd post my wallpaper on a weekly basis, call it a public static journal.

Like ... like a blog?
