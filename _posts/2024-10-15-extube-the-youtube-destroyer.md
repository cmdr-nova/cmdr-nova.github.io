You remember how Google decided that they were going to disable ad-blockers in their browser, and also make ads on YouTube *more* intrusive, and more frequent? Well, while I understand there is probably a wealth of YouTube video downloaders out there, I made my *own*. It runs on Python, it's just one executable file, and it's freakin' sweet looking, bro.

Once you download it from <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/ExTube" target="_blank">this github repo</a>, just unzip it, and run it! You have to select a directory target for where you're saving the videos, and also a URL, but after that, everything *should* be a-okay. I've tested it numerous times now and it runs fine.

Now, the download *will only* download up to a maximum of 720p resolution videos. I did this, because 1080p can get a little chunk in your HDD, and I didn't feel like making the app more complicated (such as by having to create a resolution selector). This is just, a real simple, give me the URL, and now you can watch a Youtube video without any ads whatsoever.

And! If you wanna support the YouTuber who uploaded it, you can still go right to their channel and hit that subscribble button.

But, that's it for now: Enjoy~
