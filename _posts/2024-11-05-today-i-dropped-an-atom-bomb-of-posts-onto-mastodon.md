Today I turned off my GitHub pages mirror of this site, and in doing so, I had to create my own XML feed with its own styling and all. Which ... I accomplished, pretty easily! But then my bot that's supposed to read my feed, and append old items to a file, and *only* post brand new items, exploded onto Mastodon three times with everything I've ever posted on here.

I think I could troubleshoot the issue and fix it, but at this point I don't think that's a great idea. But hey! My feed looks REALLY COOL.

Aside from dropping everything I've mostly ever written online, directly onto Mastodon, I also made some updates to the site.

I was struggling with the CORS proxy for about 10 hours, with a break for sleep in-between, and I finally figured it out. Now the Tumblr feed of my bot posting on the left sidebar is working correctly, *and* updating without the need for the site to be rebuilt.

I've also added something pretty neat to the right sidebar, directly under my haxPunks ... A list of trending topics from Mastodon! Which, when you click on a topic, you can then view who's posting about and within that hashtag via your own Mastodon instance.

I may not really be able to figure out how to turn a Jekyll site into something that's fully federated, but I can make it look like it is!

Aside from all of that, I just wanted to quickly apologize to the people who got slapped hard with all of my posts ... three times. My bad.
