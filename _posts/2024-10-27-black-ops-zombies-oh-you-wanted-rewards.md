Woohoo! A new Black Ops is out! You know what that means: It's time to go hunting zombies. Endlessly. Forever. Without pause. No extraction. Keep fighting. Run out of ammo. Die. This is, at least, *my experience*, in every Black Ops since number two.

You get your upgrades, you run around flailing your weapons until, *eventually*, the horde overcomes you, and your team is running around sporadically paying mind to only themselves. Meanwhile you're thinking about those cool skins and bonus rewards you could've gotten for a successful extraction.

If only random pick-up-groups *ever wanted to freakin' extract, ever*.

But they don't.

*Every single* random group I've ever joined, *never extracts*. Most of them don't know what they're doing, and if they do, *you're* the random. Ten waves. Fifteen waves. Thirty waves. Suddenly it's time to go do something else, because life comes at you fast.

I remember back during the previous Black Ops, what was it? Black Ops: Synthwave? There was a really neat skin for the operator I liked using the most, and the only way to get it? *A successful extraction*.

No, I didn't get it.

And now, because Activision is evil, those rewards I could've gotten back then wouldn't *even matter* now.

None of it matters.

But I just want to ask my bros and brosettes, and in-betweeners, if, for once, when we play together.

Please.

For the love of pizza and beers.

Let's extract, and get a successful finish.
