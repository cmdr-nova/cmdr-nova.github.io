I'm sure there are those who know that Bandcamp was recently bought out by a company called <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2023/11/22/songtradr-acquires-bandcamp/" target="_blank">Songtradr</a>, and this came with much dismay, because Bandcamp has been, and has mostly remained, *one of the only* music platforms where small artists could actually be discovered, heard, and *paid*. This is incongruent with current trends of the past decade and a half, of the music industry pushing real hard for streaming. Streaming, which pays fractions of a penny of a penny on a dollar, while the rich consume the profits. This has only been exasperated since AI came into the scene, with people absent of talent and inspiration, generating *absolute garbage* (and this isn't just a problem in music, it's everywhere).

I personally haven't seen, heard, or noticed any detrimental effects of Bandcamp being bought-out, but it's good to be prepared. To be prepared in an age where Mozilla is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/advertising/" target="_blank">suddenly an ad agency</a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-copilot-recall-cybersecurity-disaster" target="_blank">developing spyware</a>, OpenAI is asking governments for enough <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank">electrical power</a> to destroy the entire planet, and Apple is <a href="https://applescoop.org/story/shocking-apple-vision-pro-2-reportedly-cancelled" target="_blank">releasing products</a> people *don't want*.

We're living in a universe that is slowly becoming a perpetual backwards day (not that Microsoft was ever a decent forward-thinking company, or that OpenAI ever had any good intentions with their grift of theft, but I digress...).

But there are those who read my musings, who know I'm a freak for the fediverse.

You might guess where this is going.

"Wait, are you about to tell me that there's a motherfuggin' Bandcamp, ON THE FEDIVERSE?"

Yes, yes I am about to tell you that, Fortnite Gamer.

This morning, while I was slogging away at getting ready for work, I saw a post flash past my Mastodon feed, something like, "It's Bandcamp, but on the fediverse!"

I thought to myself, "Hmm, okay. I'll bookmark this for 10 hours from now."

So, I clicked the link and followed through to <a href="https://bandwagon.fm" target="_blank">Bandwagon.fm</a>, and, my dudes ...

I now have a "bandcamp" on the fediverse, <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/@cmdr_nova" target="_blank">over here</a>.

Save for the ability to actually *sell* your music (which I assume they're working on?), you can upload whole entire albums here, and then people can stumble in and listen to what you've made! That's WILD. ... on the FEDIVERSE?!

What I did here with my page, though, is I took the 3 most recent albums I did under Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and re-published them under my new name, PLEXX. Once I *finally* finish <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">disc eRROR 19‚Äã.‚Äã92 ~DE‚Äã-‚ÄãLUX</a>, I'll be putting that album there, too.

But this is *so cool*, and it's connected to Musicbrainz, another open-source music cataloguing project!

Earlier today, I was having second thoughts about Linux, and sticking to open source and all that. Mostly because, I sort of miss a few programs that I'm having trouble getting working on Pop!_OS. But this kind of turned me around a bit. There's *no* reason to go back to the bastardized version of whatever Bill Gates had in mind 30 years ago. This proves to me that regular people *will* restore the internet to what it should have always been.

The only thing it takes, is *patience*, and a whole lot less second-guessing myself and my decisions. And also maybe I need to sit in front of my computer screen a little less here and there. My eyes hurt.

Anyway, I *can't wait* to see what the heck comes next, holy crap.
