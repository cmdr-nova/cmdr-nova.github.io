I started learning Python, because I wanted to solve problems, and maybe eventually make a Python game. I haven't made it to being able to do the latter all that well yet, and maybe sometime here in the near future, we'll get there. But today, I'm solving a big problem. A problem brought on by Google/Reddit. Or, I should say, I'm destroying all .webp images, once and for all.

Today I wrote a very tiny and light-weight script that automatically checks your Linux downloads directory in a cronjob, and takes any .webp images it finds, and converts them to .png (and then deletes the leftover webp).

No questionable websites that promise image conversions, while also probably simultaneously installing malware and serving you 4000 ads. No more avoiding saving desktop wallpapers from Reddit like the plague.

On this day, we send .webp into the Backrooms, never to be seen again.

You can find the script <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/Anti-Webp" target="_blank">here on Github</a>, enjoy!
