I've been spending a couple of days now with using Sharkey. Bandwidth usage is around 2 gigs at the moment, up a few hundred megabytes from yesterday. This seems to tell me that, apart form initial load, and cramming my new server directly into a wall of thousands of other servers, I'll probably be around 60 or so gigs of bandwidth usage per month (out of 1 terabyte allowed). This kind of scares me (maximum being just a single terabyte), but there are *options* for mitigating this *one* remaining issue with scaling the fediverse (if for some reason 60 gigs per month is nowhere near accurate) for a normal person, with normal person money. That aside, it *is* a little jarring using the fediverse, immersing yourself in it, *while not being on Mastodon*.

Firstly, if you do this, you'll notice kind of all of a sudden, that many, *many* people speak as though the fediverse is almost entirely *just* Mastodon. And maybe it is! But, sitting on a Misskey fork, I do wonder how many people are *aware* that you don't *need* to use Mastodon in order to interact with the aforementioned Fedi?

I do detail all of this in my linked-many-times ActivityPub guide, but I guess it's mostly because Mastodon is the default, or is at least perceived that way. And, where all credit's due, it's a pretty great piece of software. But it *does* fall short in some areas.

Scaling Mastodon to be manageable, cost-wise, for a regular person with peanuts for cash, *is a challenge*. Scaling Sharkey, *so far*, has been a breeze.

Mastodon warns *against* not caching anything, even though this is one of the biggest contributors to ballooning costs. Meanwhile, in Misskey/Sharkey, you can entirely *reject* remote media caching, and it *hardly* affects your experience.

On Mastodon, there are no quote-posts, and you by-and-large pretty much *have* to gradually federate with every server your instance can see.

On Misskey/Sharkey, you can choose to become a silo where you *only* federate with whichever servers you dictate, and oh yeah, you can quote-post. You can *also* gain achievements? And much like Discord, you can depict user roles in order to control *how* your instance is used, up to and including rate-limiting users who may be something like, *extreme posters*.

That all isn't to say that I *wouldn't* return to Mastodon, but I feel like, in eight years, we've seen a tiny trickle of new content and functionality, and I don't think it has to take that long? There are a lot of different things you *should* be able to do with Mastodon, that you *still cannot do*, just because the people behind its development don't wanna do those things. They don't want to accommodate to the many user-requested features in order to improve user experience, and retention, because ... ? 

Your guess is as good as mine.
