In more themes around developing automation for my daily internet-life, I decided to make *even more* little features for my website. Have you ever visited a webpage and thought to yourself, "Man, I wish there was like, a huge mountain of data and pictures for me to stare it!" Well, my friend, I am here to give you exactly that. With JavaScript and Python, I give you, Pixelfed, and my latest product from Second Life!

Tooling around with Pixelfed's API was a little frustrating, and I *still* haven't figured out what I was doing wrong in order to pull statuses *directly* from the source (with an access code). So, in order to do this, regardless, I decided to utilize my Pixelfed profile atom feed to do *exactly* what I was trying to accomplish. RSS is the past, and also the future! ... apparently.

If you scroll down and look to the left, you'll see the five most recent photos from my Pixelfed account, which will update automatically as I add new things to it.

After that, I took my simmering migraine headache, and made some scripts to take a look at my Second Life store's marketplace page. Pointed some python at it and said "Assemble the link, then open the link, then extract the photo and the title."

Done.

Down on the right of the page, you can see my latest product from my Second Life store, and if you click it, you'll go right to the page!

At this point, I have *kind of* a large amount of content connected to API and my proxy servers, all pulling information from the different platforms I interact with, *as I update them*. And that's what automation is all about.

Removing obstacles to things I want to do, and things I want to show the world.

Anyway, I'm not sure I feel like putting these code snippets and scripts onto Github today. My head *hurts*, like *ass*.

So, that's the post.
