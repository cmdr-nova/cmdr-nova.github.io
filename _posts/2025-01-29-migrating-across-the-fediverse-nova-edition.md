So, last night I was poking around in my VPS billing reports, and I was going over some things. Basically, I have *plenty* of bandwidth for the mass of incoming media across the fediverse on my Mastodon instance ... *but*, all the things I have running, in order to keep it operating smoothly, are costing me nearly 70-80 USD a month, **and** my instance is beginning to experience slow-down. This is not good. If I felt more secure in my current job, and wanted to keep spending that much, maybe this wouldn't be an issue. But, for now, it kinda is. Therefore, I'm migrating away from hosting my own instance, for now.

As of now, and as my account migrates in this exact moment, I've moved over to labyrinth.zone, on the account <a href="https://labyrinth.zone/daemon_nova" target="_blank">@daemon_nova</a>.

The good news is, I'm still able to maintain a feed of my posts on this site, and *also* fediverse comments beneath my posts (although, once I shut-off the instance, old ones will obviously be broken). The down-side, is that I haven't quite work out some of the kinks, because comments from *myself* show up as unidentified in the "instance" field of a comment.

Since I'm not sure how to extract a user ID number from Akkoma, this will just have to be like that for now.

The feed, on the other-hand, was just a quick simple RSS feed hack that took me 10 minutes to setup.

But, the bad news is, since I'm not sure you can setup API keys on an Akkoma account, I'll have to share my posts *manually*, for now. Which is kinda okay? It's an alright trade-off for saving myself 70 USD a month.

Plus, copy / pasting isn't that hard. I only automated this because I can be overwhelmed sometimes.

Either way, the migration process was *sort of* smooth. I think I briefly nearly crashed the instance (my bad) due to the amount of follows I have. And, if you're following me, and notice that I'm not, it's not because I unfollowed you! It's because the Mastodon > Akkoma follow transfer didn't go through 100%, so I unfortunately will have to refollow some people, *as I notice them*.

Thanks for coming along in my fediverse journey. We'll see where it goes from here! I'm mainly doing this, *also*, because I wanted to focus more on maintaining my website, rather than doing that, *plus* being the full-time admin of my own Mastodon instance.

So, I think things will only get cooler from here.
