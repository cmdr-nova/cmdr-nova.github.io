Because my Mastodon timeline isn't spicy and chaotic enough, I scraped together pieces of things I'm trying to learn and utilize in Python, and put together <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/reddit_rss_bot" target="_blank">a whole entire bot</a> that posts images from a Reddit RSS feed, directly to Mastodon.

You heard me.

When there is no more room in hell, the anime boobs will walk the Mastodon.

Obviously, there is some room for failure here. Failure, in that, sometimes people post AI-generated sludge to Reddit, and that *may* get caught in the bot. If it happens too often, I'll either figure out how to exclude that stuff, or just not include that specific subreddit in the bot's pull.

This is sort of still ongoing, too. I tried a bunch of different tricks to get the bot to stop posting the preview, tiny, pixelated image, but to no avail. Or, maybe to vail. It *may* be just my instance that isn't uploading them correctly, but I'm not sure yet.

If you want to see the bot directly, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/@net_run" target="_blank">it's here</a>. Warning, though, some of the posts it grabs are NSFW and entirely lewd. You have been warned.

This is pretty cool, though, because, the last time I did *anything* like this, it was a **chatbot** that I integrated with a <a href="https://gnusocial.network" target="_blank">GNU Social</a> (still around today) instance I was running, way, way back in ... 2017, I think?

Kinda brings back memories, even if that instance is completely lost to time, and only viewable in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180314155440/http://sanguine.merylscarlett.info/" target="_blank">fragments of an Apache default page</a> on archive.org.

As for Python, so far it feels like writing CSS, but with a lot more statements, and also things that can go wrong!

But anyway, it's time for my nightly iPad and Youtube ritual.
