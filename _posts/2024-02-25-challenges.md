<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think the most challenging thing for me will be establishing myself in a new place of work, and in-turn working through consolidating or otherwise lowering the amount of debt that I owe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Debt’s a troubling thing, especially when it comes from the loss of a pet, and the swindlers behind veterinarian offices. An experience I will likely never forget.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your pet is sick, what do you do? You get them help, right? Well, that’s exactly the reason these people might hold your pet hostage for extravagant fees. it’s sort of the same deal with mechanics. Hey, you need your car? Well, it’s gonna cost you 3000 dollars to get it back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But anyway, life, for me has been nothing but challenge, after challenge, and not much clear-minded rest. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Someday soon, maybe that’ll be a reality.</p>
