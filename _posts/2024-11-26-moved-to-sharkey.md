Today I was messing around with a Linux VPS, like you do. And I thought to myself, "I wonder what it would be like to launch a Sharkey instance?" And so I did! And, while I *have* had prior experience with Sharkey ... I like to run things myself. I like to tinker with them. And now I have a full Sharkey instance, *that I can surely edit to my liking on the command line*.

But, and I mean, Mastodon is great, but! Sharkey has *a lot* more customization options, *a lot* more *everything*. And because I'm pretty much an advanced fediverse user, I figured, "Hell yeah, let's do it." So, I'm migrating everything to my new Sharkey instance at <a href="https://sharkey.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">sharkey.mkultra.monster</a>, and once I feel like it won't break anything, I'll likely be turning off the Mastodon instance. The sharkey instance is *also* cheaper, and I need to save my money.

I've also got just about *every single* script I've made, hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS, working correctly and posting to the new instance, *including* the auto-posting this blog does once I hit commit!

The only downside, is posts aren't going to have comments until I figure out a different way to do them, and some of the elements on my sidebars here are commented out until I design a *different* way to display my presence on the fediverse.

All-in-all, this is *really* cool, and I'm sure I'll spend countless hours redoing scripts to interface with Sharkey (lol oh god).
