You might be thinking, "Slow writer? You've written like 800 babillion things on this website!" And while that *may* be true, I've also got three books on the burner I've started and never finished. My next and upcoming book, Dissolution Protocol, *especially*. Having just read over everything I've written for it so far, I realize I uh, didn't get that far. And now I want to continue ... but, how do you share and raise awareness around written fiction in the age of plagiarism?

I'm fairly confident that I can share snippets of things on Mastodon, and not worry all that much about my work being vacuumed up by a machine for use in some soulless idiot's money-making scheme, but where else can you go? Forums are probably a no, and <a href="https://lemmy.zip/post/22031416" target="_blank">even NaNoWriMo are now AI shills</a>.

And that's the *problem.* I nearly entirely gave up writing fiction, the second I found out that these machines were going online to scrape the whole internet for the sole purpose of profiting off of other people's work. I mean, how do you respond to that, as someone who *makes* things, with *your own hands?*

Frankly, I responded by saying, "Well screw it, I'm not doing *anything* then."

But I *can't* just do nothing.

It drives me mad.

It's why I've turned this website into a machine that has like a million different functions.

*I need to create*.

I guess this post is an ask to other writers who didn't decide to give up, and keep going, even in the face of nonstop plagiarism from the likes of festering pimple, Sam Altman: What do you do? How do you share what you're doing, or *writing*, if it's no longer safe to post your work *anywhere*, *even in a finished state!*
