Today was a ... day, at work. I mean, it's always a *day* of sorts, but work is always, you know, *work*. But I got out, I drove, I arrived, I shoved food into my gullet, and then I sat down to reformat the front matter of over one hundred different old posts from my numerous blogs I've had over the years (some of which were abandoned to time for a very long ... time).

A lot of this required editing some of the front matter so that it actually displays properly on Jekyll, which, I *entirely* blame Wordpress for. The Jekyll export plugin available over there does the job, uhm, sort of? Like, you get your posts out, and it has front matter for Jekyll ... but it's all wrong, and will spit all kinds of errors at you if you use any kind of punctuation in your post titles.

But anyway, you can see now, that my blog is currently consisting of around 57 pages to sift through, which makes the search function up in the nav section really useful!

A lot of posts date all the way back to 2015 when my store in Second Life was brand new, and I was posting almost *daily* about new products I was releasing. And then, as time marches forward, I have a handful of posts about some fiction I was writing. In some of these posts, including more recent ones, images may be broken, or absent entirely. This is something I ... tentatively want to fix, at least, for the more recent posts. But, I may not be able to, or might just decide I don't have the energy for it.

The import and reformat of all of these posts was *mostly* done as a more historical data keeping sort of thing. I don't want to *lose* everything I've ever written anymore. Speaking of, I wrote some comprehensive guides on beginning in Second Life over a year ago, and they were thought to be completely lost. Until I realized that Archive.org had *literally all of it, backed up, free of charge*. So, [that's back](/pages/howtosl).

All-in-all, this website went from being completely bare-bones, to having *most* of everything I've done, *ever*, since 2015. And that's, a lot.

That I have no issues uploading and storing all of that here on Github is pretty amazing ... Despite Github's takeover by Microsoft, and Microsoft's constant blunders with AI and installing spyware on your PC.

I do wonder, though, what happens if for some reason I need more storage space. I've never really explored that avenue, and I don't even know if you can *pay* for more space or not. But, you know, mountains and molehills, issues that we'll resolve if ever they need to be crossed off the list. For now, this is quite fine.
