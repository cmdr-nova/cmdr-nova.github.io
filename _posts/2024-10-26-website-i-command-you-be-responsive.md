Today, I got home from work, and for *once* wasn't feeling too tired to even type on my keyboard. So, I logged into Second Life and acquired some land, and noticed I could hold a little more. I shot off a ticket to Linden Labs and asked for some more space, because ... I'd like to build things. While I sat waiting for a response to this ticket (which I'm *still* waiting on) I did what any normal person would do. I fully redesigned the way my website responds to different screens.

This is something that I would consider a *major milestone* in my web development journey, because, for all intents and purposes, you *should* be able to view it without issue even if you're on an iPhone 3G. Now, does that mean my CSS is cleaned up and tidy, and there's nothing left-over that shouldn't be there? Absolutely not. There is a ton of stuff in there that probably isn't currently being used, or is conflicting with something else ... I just, haven't had the energy to do *all of that* just yet.

But I will!

As you can see, on my to-do list.

And, thankfully, I managed to achieve all of this *without* disrupting the flow of my little vanishing sidebar with all of my links.

What prompted me to do this, though, were a few things. Someone I know on Mastodon tried visiting my website on a phone that is considerably older than an iPhone 15, and it bothered me that this person couldn't quite see anything correctly, and there was some kind of invisible box blocking off half the content. Upon investigating a few days ago, utilizing the Vivaldi browser developer tools and device simulation, I was able to see exactly that.

Ew.

But, now, not only is that bar *gone*, or invisible box vaporized, but this website *should* display completely legibly on *anything*. Of course, I still have the specific media query setup for tiny screens in portrait mode, which I think works pretty well. But now, if you turn your phone or tablet sideways, it should look *great*, and give you a glimpse of everything a desktop user can see. Without issue. Hopefully.

Comment on this via the Mastodon link and let me know how it looks for you! Because of the nature of web development, I'm almost *sure* there's someone out there who will have some kind of viewing issue. Maybe someone visiting my website from the screen-reader on their refrigerator. Who knows!

But anyway, what to do next? üòà
