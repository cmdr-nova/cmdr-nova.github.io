I meant to write about this earlier, but I guess I'll do that now as I wait for The Sims 1 and 2 Legacy Editions to download (which, I've had to reinstall on my SSD so that they'll load???) But, a few days ago (before I migrated to another instance), I saw someone basically, kind of, sort of, complaining that making a website is like this unattainable act, or practice, and that this is why most people just post on short-form media. My initial reaction was to be like, "What the hell are you talking about?" But, I realize, that things I find extremely simple, like writing HTML, or signing up on a fediverse instance, are actually really complicated for some.

So, in the same way I wrote guides for getting setup on Mastodon, I'm writing guides on <a class="page-link" href="/pages/webdev/">how to build a website from scratch, for beginners</a>!

I've merely *started* it, at this point. Partially because, my offline job sort of interrupted the flow of me making this, but also because I'm now home, and tired, and don't feel much like writing more, at the moment. But, what I plan to do with this, is have full guides on getting *something* running, for people who *at least* have an interest in *reading* things, and figuring out how to do this, on their own. I understand that *even that* is asking too much, for some people.

Regardless, though, for the people who want to do these things, I wanted to help make it just a little simpler.

Alongside that, <a href="https://malici.ous.computer/@shellsharks" target="_blank">@shellsharks</a> on fedi (short for fediverse) has been a huge source of inspiration, and ideas, and is the person to thank, or *blame*, for my entirely renewed interest in building, maintaining, and writing on my own website. In that same vein, he's also the idea-maker behind syndicating your own posts from social media (that you want to showcase for more than the 30 seconds they appear to others on the timeline) directly to your website.

Now, it's not *real* syndication, in a sense that a post automatically appears on your site. It's more like, manually backing up a post, and then linking to it. Which is fine!

I actually wanted to do this long ago, but my idea for going about it, was to somehow make it so that I could create a post *on my website*, and have it post to ActivityPub, in the way you might make a normal post *on Mastodon*, rather than a full blog post. So, in other words, I was trying to make my website *be* the compose box for Mastodon (or some other such ActivityPub client). Uh ... this was kind of a really nuts idea, that I'm sure is possible in like a month of nonstop coding and hacking, but ultimately? Nah.

Instead, I've decided to do <a class="page-link" href="/pages/notes/">this</a>. A page where I just type in posts I want to showcase, and then hit "save."

Easy peasy.

*Now*, to figure out why Sims 1 and 2 Legacy Editions won't run properly without being installed on an SSD.

Last time I checked, at least one of them functioned perfectly on a 486.
