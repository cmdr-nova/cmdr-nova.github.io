So, much to the dismay of boss/es at the offline job, I'm taking off work today, because going to work feeling every ache and pain in my bones and muscles as this bronchitis, or the flu, ravages my immune system without rest, is just *too freakin much*. I get fed lines like, "I come to work no matter what unless I'm *literally* dying." And, I mean, I guess, hats-off to those of you who wish to die on the job, or collapse in a lesser sense. But that isn't me.

I'm freakin' *sick*. Haven't been this sick since I had covid in 2022.

But, I wanted to make this post today, to share some things I do, because I can *at least* still type on my laptop, and would like to present some ways you can buy things, or services from me (so that I can recoup what's lost from having to call out from work).

Firstly, I run a tiny little online business, wherein I make link-pages for people. How this works, is that you pay me, give me the details of all the links you want on the page, plus any images, gifs, or other elements, and then I put it together. Once it's assembled, I put it up on Neocities with a username of your choosing and a placeholder password (that you'll have to change), and hand you the keys. Easy-peasy, and a great way to break free from monthly payments and contracts from the big corporations trying to sell this to you on a continuous basis.

You can see more about this, <a href="https://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">here</a>.

I also make music, and, funnily enough, it's *because of my offline job* that my next album is taking me *so long* to complete. I'm really only a few tracks in, with ideas for more coming up. Regardless, I do have it on preorder, and will have to just keep adjusting that release date until it's actually ready. Never-the-less, you can check out disc eRROR 19‚Äã.‚Äã92 ~DE‚Äã-‚ÄãLUX, <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">here</a>.

Finally, if you just like what I do, be it what I do with my website, or applications I develop, or what I do with music, or even Second Life, you can sign up on my Ko-fi, maybe even on a monthly basis! Find that link, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">here</a>.

I would also list my Second Life store marketplace here, but the pay from purchases on products within that store, and inside of Second Life, is so criminally low, it would only make a difference if someone bought *everything* in the store, all-at-once.

Either way, thanks for stopping by and giving all of this a read--I'm going to go lay down until a request comes in~
