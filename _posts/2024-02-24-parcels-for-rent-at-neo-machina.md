<p>Hello, and good day to the denizens of the world, and also, the virtual world, <a href="https://secondlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Second Life</a>! Today I'm writing to make available some information about what's going on at <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Neo%20Machina/12/122/1501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neo Machina</a>, my future-city sim within the virtual world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a full year, Neo Machina mostly only had on-sim rentals, including a few shop spaces, and apartments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2024, Neo Machina was upgraded to a full region with capacity for 110 total users, and 30,000 land impact. With that, I've begun the expansion of the city to the (near) full expanse of the sim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also placed down more spaces for on-sim rentals including apartments, homes, and shops, and it doesn't stop there!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of right now, there are two parceled skyboxes for rent, which you can buy, and control with full parcel rights. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first rental is over at <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Neo%20Machina/6/8/2001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Synchro</a>, a 1792 square meter parcel at 2000 meters in the air, coming in at 820 land impact for 852 linden per week.</p>

<p>The second rental is over at <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Neo%20Machina/17/239/2001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmina</a>, a 1024 square meter parcel also at 2000 meters in the air, coming in at 468 land impact for 482 linden per week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both of these parcels can be "purchased" as part of your land ownership, and used as you please (with the exception to some simple rules to follow that you'll find in an informational box at the parcel itself). Both of these parcels are a great deal in comparison to what's normally on offer around Second Life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, normally, when you rent a 1024 sq. parcel anywhere else in Second Life, your land impact will vary from 200-300. But with Neo Machina, you get a bonus of over 150 land impact! Dang choom, that's pretty sweet, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, use the above links to drop by in-world and give them a look-see for yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Renters should stay within the land area and elevation provided, any breakage of rules can result in revocation of said parcels, and without a refund.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for your interest!</p>
