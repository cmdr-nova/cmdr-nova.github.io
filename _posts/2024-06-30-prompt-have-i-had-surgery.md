<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Have you ever had surgery? What for?</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today's prompt asks a very specific question, that should have a real clear-cut answer. I'm not even sure why I'm answering it, aside from the fact that I just need something to write about! So here we are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, I haven't ever had for real surgery, where they cut and stitch. But! This does remind me of the time I had pneumothorax, and the reasoning the doctors gave me for having it absolutely blew me away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a long time ago, back in my twenties, when I'd just barely started working in retail. I was grinding the third shift and going about my day as usual: Throw freight, tear boxes, put things on shelves, take a lunch, do it again. I remember at some point in the middle of the night, I suddenly had a real hard time breathing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In covid-culture, you'd probably call it shortness of breath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I distinctly remember telling my manager, "Hey, I think I have to go to the hospital, I'm having a hard time breathing."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I still remember him saying something along the lines of, "Well, if that's what you think you need to do."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because, obviously, he wasn't inclined to let me go anywhere without some kind of pushback. <em>I was supposed to be working the product to the shelves, after all.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did, in fact, believe that's what I needed. I didn't call an ambulance, I didn't call either of my parents to ask them to take me. I hopped in my jalopy of a car, and drove myself to the emergency room and explained to them what was wrong. And, for whatever reason, the next moments would be something that scarred me for life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They sat me down in a waiting room that had curtains around it, where they'd do the procedure. It wasn't a real room, it was just a row of sheets hanging from metal poles in some kind of big, huge room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then this freakin' doctor walks in, and he says, "Well, strip down to your skivvies!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn't know what the hell that meant. But I waited for him to walk away, and I took off all of my clothes down to my underwear (it turns out, after a Google search fifteen years later, that's what skivvies means). Then, a woman about my age at the time brought in one of those medical gowns patients wear, and she asked if I wanted help putting it on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think I said yes because a lot of movement made breathing pretty painful. And, I guess that's why it seemed like I needed help doing this. So she assisted me in wrapping it around my body, and she got entirely too close for comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, that was only the beginning of things I would think about forever, and ever, in the middle of the night when my brain needs something to go "What the fuck?" at: This girl, pulling a sheet around me, staring down at my skinny underwear-ed body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What the fuck, indeed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She left, and then I was all alone again, and I think about twenty minutes passed while I sat there in this gown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But they came in with these machines and a tube, laid me down on the bed and I think there were like five of them. They stuck a hole in my chest, and ran that tube down into my lung. There was a lot of pressure, and I remember expressing that it was <em>pretty</em> painful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember the female doctor looking down at me and remarking that it's <em>not that bad</em>, as if <em>she</em> was me, and I wasn't me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later, after the little procedure, that I guess we can think of as some sort of "surgery," they asked if I wanted some kind of pain meds. You know, the strong stuff. I kind of chuckled, because I had no experience with this stuff, and I was thinking about TV shows where patients tried to trick doctors into giving them strong drugs so that they could get high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They took my chuckle the wrong way and gave me some ibuprofen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn't help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spent about a day there, and when the doctor who shoved the tube into my chest came in to speak to me ... she told me this happened to me ... because I was tall and skinny. And, being a smoker at the time, a male doctor told me that if I didn't quit smoking, he'd have to chop off half of my lung.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't smoke cigarettes anymore, I vape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When all's said and done, my Dad came and took me home, and then I had two weeks off of work in order to recover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, it's been about fifteen years or so, but Hershey Medical Center, or Hershey Hospital, in Pennsylvania, I just wanna know one thing: What the hell?</p>
