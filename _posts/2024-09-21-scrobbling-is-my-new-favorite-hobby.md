Back in 2012, and I don't even remember how I went about it, I spent enormous amounts of time scrobbling my music listening habits to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>. This lasted into 2014, and I am at least *semi* certain I started using Spotify for this. How I did before that time ... I think I must've been using Winamp to track things I was listening to.

Yes. That's it.

Then I eventually created a new account for my musical presence under *Eyeshadow 2600 FM* and scrobbled into the 30,000s, and, like with my original account, eventually stopped doing this, as well. I also don't really have any interest in reviving the ES2600FM Last.fm account, but that's more to do with the piss-poor online synthwave community than anything (bullying, harassment, stalking, black-listing, etc).

Now we'll snap into 2024, like a time machine, and I'm back at it again scrobbling on Last.fm, because it's *much* simpler to do now. But, I'm mostly doing this because I found this little open source project that's *like* Last.fm, but more like an entire open-web social media network of your listening habits, a Wiki that documents *every song ever*, and even an app you can use on your PC to submit meta-data to their database.

It's honestly pretty wild, and I only discovered it because of a side-account I made via the Fediverse on <a href="https://kitsunes.club/@foxx_nova" target="_blank">kitsunes.club</a>. Have I mentioned that Sharkey (a misskey fork) is really cool, and I'm *half* considering using it as a primary and dropping the costs of hosting my own instance (I'm still not sure about this, though, because I *have* to have some kind of account on a Mastodon server, if only to at least have a place to link my posts here so that I can have comments)?

But anyway, the database is at <a href="https://musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a>, and once you've made an account there, you can head over to <a href="https://listenbrainz.org" target="_blank">ListenBrainz</a>, and then connect all of your music-listening apps. By doing this, you can scrobble to Last.fm, *and* directly to ListenBrainz, where your tastes, history, listening trends and habits all become part of this little ... social network of *everyone's* listening habits. It's, again, really *cool*.

If you've gotten past all of that, and you *still* want more, and *also* have a digital music collection just sitting on your PC collecting dust, you can then grab <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">Picard</a>, and catalogue your collection from your hard drive directly to MusicBrainz.

The best part about all of this, is that it can be *mostly* entirely automatic, requiring little input from the user, depending on *what* you use for music.

I definitely recommend anyone who regularly listens to music to give all of this a try, and also <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/user/foxx_nova" target="_blank">follow me</a> on ListenBrainz! Let's compare our musical taste!

Anything that makes it feel like it's still 2000 to 2010 internet is a-okay in my book.
