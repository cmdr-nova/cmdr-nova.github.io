Today I'm starting (and maybe ending for the day lol) with a brand new mesh garment and one of the first dresses I've ever made!<br />
<br />
This one in-particular is shaded black with a pentagram printed across the front. Many different variations are planned, as well. This pack includes 5 sizes that fit most average shapes, but it also includes an alpha.<br />
<br />
Come try a demo inworld with the link below!<br />
