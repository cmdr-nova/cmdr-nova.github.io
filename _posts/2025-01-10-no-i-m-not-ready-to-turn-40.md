In May this year, I'll be 40 years old. It's something that's been weighing heavy on my mind since the second the year began. Me ... 40 years old? It doesn't make any sense to me. It can't be, can it? How did I make it this far, and why does it feel like nothing has changed all that much? Where do I go from here, or, what do I do next? Why can't I shake this immense internal feeling of sadness? And it goes on, and on.

It was only moments ago that I turned off Mass Effect 3 at its ending, head buzzing, rushing to the BioWare forums to express my thoughts and feelings. It was 2012, and I was just barely 28 years old. Life became a tumultuous thing after that. I started a transition, I experienced things in my life that permanently altered the way I think about things, the way I see the world, and *the way I see other people*. And then 10 years flashed by.

And, I know, it feels like I'm complaining. But I have stable work, even if it hurts my body to the point of painful exhaustion near everyday. Things are relatively stable, even if I'm not in exactly the right place that I want to be.

I have my goals, and I'm still working toward them.

But I'm turning 40.

40.

In the blink of an eye I'll be 50, then 60, then 70, and it's just too fast.

I look back at the past 20-30 years, and I can't believe it's all gone.

My grandparents are gone, and I don't think I ever really processed it all that much. Tons, and tons of friends, are just gone. All the people I've dated over the years, gone. Gone, and gone, and never to be heard from again.

And then there was the cat that I took care of, that I rescued from an abusive home, who stayed with me for 14 years or so, before she passed. And I still think about her to this day, and I feel so sorry for her, that I didn't have the perfect life, to give her a boundless house to roam and maybe even the care she could have had, to live just a little while longer.

Like everything, it's all gone *too soon*. Things I wanted to do, the opportunities pass, and then I have to rethink everything, make new goals, reboot my life.

It's an endless cycle, and then it all leads up to this point in 2025, where I'm simultaneously in not really all that much of a bad life situation, but at the same time, I wish I had so much more. I wish I could have it. None of this is how I imagined it, or I would be, when I was just a teenager. And now it feels like it's nearing the end. And I know it's not the end. But I feel like it's coming faster than it should.

I don't want to be 40 years old, but I have to be. Because the universe is a bastard that doesn't give a shit. And I'll wake up tomorrow, and I'll go to work, and I'll keep doing the same thing every day, until I can find the magic switch that changes everything.

If that switch exists.
