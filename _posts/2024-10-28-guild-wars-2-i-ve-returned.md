It's been years since I've *seriously* played Guild Wars 2 in a way that constitutes actually completing content, and leveling up. In fact, I haven't really played it much since the years that I spent outside of the traditional work-force. And that was back around Path of Fire, and now there's at least three expansions I've missed, and need to catch up on. So I logged the heck on.

What I've missed, includes the Champions Ice Brood Saga quest, which seems to go on and on forever (so much so, that I'm taking a break and returning to it tomorrow).

But what I find kind of remarkable is that despite it being 2024, despite most things kind of ... sucking ass, and a lot of MMOs and games in-general feeling repetitive, rehashed, polished to the point of being dull, and just not fun, Guild Wars 2 still feels fresh. It feels fresh in the sense that it's like a portal back to 2014, when things were better. Not ... the *best*, but *better*.

I wish I could say the same about some of the communities *outside* of the game, and specifically via Reddit, and into Discord. It seems Reddit moderators are always out to ruin fun, and deploy control fantasies they don't have the power to employ anywhere else. Being me, posting in the Guild Wars 2 discord asking some of the guilds if they'd be a good fit for me, and *immediately* getting slapped down and being told I needed to go use the guild recruitment subreddit.

Hey, Reddit mods: Have you ever considered that enforcing hefty restrictions on everything might not be the best way to go about things? That maybe it creates an unwelcoming and hostile atmosphere in an age where it's *much harder* to connect with people?

I dunno.

Just spit-balling here.

With that in mind, do I have any Guild Wars 2 players in the United States viewing this blog, or this post? Do ya have a guild? Can I join it?
