<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s Wordpress prompt is all about a theme featured in one of my favorite movie franchises: The Matrix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Are our fates already foretold?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Normally, I would say, no. Absolutely not. The universe exists in total chaos and we, the human species, exist entirely by biological accident. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then again, maybe that’s incorrect?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are already theories about potential for a multiverse to be a thing that really exists. An infinite number of universes like our own, existing side-by-side in a dimension of space that we cannot see or experience as beings who live solely on a three dimensional plane.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it’s true that there are an infinite number of each and every one of us, then time itself is something that must already be laid out in front of us, and also behind us. And I do believe that this also has something to do with relativity, or not. I’m not sure, I just know a lot about black holes and what happens to time and space beyond one of those horizons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, is Neo’s fate much like our own? Predetermined, doomed to happen again and again, even with slight variance in the way these things happen?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who knows, maybe?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ll probably never know for sure. Just like we’ll never truly know how the universe came to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did some higher being or winding path in time and space determine that I would write this post from my phone, at 11:47 pm on a Friday?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know what, I doubt it.</p>
