I've been spending a couple of days sprucing up my site, adding things to the feed, making it more like ... a *social media* feed, and then I got myself a copy of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Now, I played a little bit of the first one, but that was years back, and I got confused or stuck around the beginning, so I didn't really pick it up again. At the time, it was a game I never really saw anyone talk about, so I didn't really assume much of it.

That was, until the second one released.

Long story short, I have it. I played through ... the beginning.

Not to spoil too much, I *eventually* made it to the point where the game drops you off into the world, and pushes you in the direction of doing *whatever the heck it was you want to do.*

Oh boy.

I got let out of the pillory (yes, you get arrested, for reasons), and my buddy, the stuck-up dude, well, he abandoned me. I'm not sure if this was a consequence of your own actions, or if it's meant to happen. So, I'm just going to assume that this is *supposed* to happen.

A lady stops you and helps you out a little, mentions something about finding work.

See, I'm someone who comes from games like Skyrim and Baldur's Gate. I'm pretty familiar with finding quests in RPGs. 

Haha.

I think I spent about ten minutes running around trying to figure out who would pay me to do things, until I ran into someone's house and saw a bowl of food. I figured, "Hey, nobody's here, and I need to eat!" So *I did*.

Upon immediately turning around, there's a guy staring at me, and you can probably guess what happened next.

I was back in the pillories.

Another day later, I'm notified that if I commit another crime, I'll be marked by an executioner or something, and that my character is fed up.

I put my clothes back on and head back into town again, hoping that maybe *this time* I'll find some work. I wander around for a bit, and almost get hit with multiple trespassing charges.

It's at this point that I'm getting kind of tired with my bumbling self almost, or completely breaking the law. I ran all the way out of town into the woods, and fell asleep in some abandoned camp under a bunch of trees. Finally, I was fully healed, and eating an apple out of my pocket.

Yeah. I had food in my pockets that I forgot about.

But now it was night time and pitch black. I'm warned about carrying a torch, in that, it's a crime if I don't have one. Another crime!

So I ran. I ran and ran directly into more woods, until I stumbled upon another small village. Nobody's around. Perfect chance to ... steal a horse! Which, was pretty easy, but I'm assuming that because it was dark, nobody saw me!

I decided for myself that my quest was to find my dog, so I road off into the dark again. Fell off the horse a few times, got back on. Eventually, after fumbling with my map and not being able to see where I'm going, I make it to where my dog is supposed to be, and I'm stopped by some guy.

I killed that guy, and took all his money.

Then I found 125 moneys in a pot under another tree by a rock.

With my dog still missing, I figured I'd run around the lake and at least see if ... I can find anymore dead bodies with loot.

No such luck.

I run into a pack of wild dogs, and after about three minutes of flailing my sword around, I am dead.

And back at the village that I ran away from.

The game is pretty cool so far! I've definitely been experiencing some sort of deliverance, that's for sure. Delivering my own self into pillories and death.

We'll see how it goes next time I load it up.
