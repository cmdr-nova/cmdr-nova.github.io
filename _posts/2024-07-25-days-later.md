So it's been a few days since I've posted here on the new site, and there's a really great reason for that! I was having a *huge* error with pagination. Or, to be more specific, the deprecated paginator plugin for Github's Jekyll. I think I must've gone through about forty different arrangements of code, and also deletion of code, and edited code, and re-edited code, and then complete deletion. I was pulling out my hair, I was crying and shidding into my pillow ... I was swearing and cursing up and down in commit comments and in a help request on the official Jekyll repo.

Luckily, someone I know via Mastodon, user [@TheIdOfAlan@hachyderm.io](https://mkultra.monster/@TheIdOfAlan@hachyderm.io){:target="_blank"}, jumped in and wrote some revised code in a pull request via the repo for this website. And ... he completely fixed it. This website now has proper pagination. No infinite scrolling that obscures the footer! And I didn't even have to change the theme. A really huge thanks to Alan, once again!

You'll also notice that every single post has a comment section! This is due-in-part to the utterances plugin that utilizes Github itself for conversations, as if you're replying to an issue in a repo. Except the "issue" is my post, and you can say whatever you want. I *also* need to impliment a search feature, and possibly a light and dark mode switch toggle. But, that's for the future, because I've had quite enough of grueling code-stabbing for ... uh, this week, at least.

Next up comes one of the easiest and also more fun parts of web development! CSS customization! I'm an absolute noob when it comes to using Ruby, *even though I definitely have some experience with it thanks to early builds of Mastodon*. But HTML and CSS are my game, I've been doing this since 1999 (or maybe even earlier than that, thanks to Geocities).

My offline job has been keeping me busy and running me ragged, so that's really all I have the energy to write for now. But it feels good to be back into having absolute *full* control of my website, down to the code.
