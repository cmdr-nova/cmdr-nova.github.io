Since the inception of REVOSA and with just about every single product I've sold, I've also given away a free energy drink with all packages.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how many people have purchased items from me, but I <i>assume </i>that very many people have at least one REVOSA Energy Drink stashed in their inventory.<br />
<br />
So, today, I decided to make a jacket very much in the style of other energy drink product jackets, and now you can represent the tangy sweet drink <i>and</i> get a caffeine high! Of course, it comes in 5 sizes, includes an alpha, and if you have any fitting issues, I am here to help!<br />
<br />
You might be wondering if I'll ever make men's themed clothes, and I would like to, maybe, at some point, although I lack an adequate man avatar, along with dude sizes for my Blender projects. Plus, being heavily female oriented as I am (bisexual leaning lesbian), I'm not really losing any sleep over making clothing that mostly caters to women. Sorry guys!<br />
<br />
I <i>do</i> want to learn how to make appliers, because I have some nifty ideas for tattoos and stockings, but have no idea how appliers work. But anyway...<br />
