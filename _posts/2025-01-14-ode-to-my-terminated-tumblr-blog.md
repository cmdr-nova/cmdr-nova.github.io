Twas a month before Christmas, and all through the web, not a creature was stirring, not even a pleb. When all of a sudden, and out of the blue, my blog was deleted, like a silent *fuck you*. No e-mail, no support, no response, and no word--They took all my work, and left but a turd. And time, that would pass, I sit and I think, "Damn ... that sucks ass." 

And all over the net, complaints you can find, of blogs deleted, and reasons confined. On Reddit, on Twitter, on Mastodon, too; I hope Matt Mullenweg has trouble takin' a poo.

If an alternative you seek, go on, take a peak, <a href="https://app.wafrn.net" target="_blank">Wafrn is here</a>, so don't shed a tear. For me, for you, for your buddy John, too, come one, come all, sign the frick up, get away from Tumblr, cause they fuckin' suck.
