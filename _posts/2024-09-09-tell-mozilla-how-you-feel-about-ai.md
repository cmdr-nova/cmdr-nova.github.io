Hey folks! Not a huge update today, but someone on my Mastodon timeline shared a post in regards to Mozilla asking for feedback on their incoming "AI toolbar."

I think *anyone* with an ounce of morals, who know the societal and environmental impacts of AI, should go here and tell Mozilla exactly how you feel about them trying to shove AI into Firefox. Of all the browsers, I *never* would have expected a so-called privacy focused company to jump onto a trend that's all about plagiarism and ripping people off. And that's aside from the detrimental effects that could be caused by allowing space for scrapers *in the browser you use* on a daily basis.

Stand alongside artists, writers, musicians, and developers, <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/share-your-feedback-on-the-ai-services-experiment-in-nightly/m-p/68389" target="_blank">and tell them, *"No."*</a>
