I was talking to someone on Threads, whose name I won't mention, because I *do* think she actually believes Twitter is still the only real place to be. But it brought up some thoughts, and interesting points. There are *some* people who refuse to abandon Twitter. Sex workers, parts of the LGBTQ+ community, and so on. Despite being an attack vector for everyone who hates the aforementioned with every fiber of their being, some of these people still resume their patronage to the Musk-site, hotbed of misinformation and algorithmic content scraping.

Recently, I *finally* downloaded my Tweet archive, and deactivated my account. Making Mastodon my main place to be.

And it's strange to me, do these people *not know* that Mastodon/the fediverse has quite a few LGBTQ+ and/or sex worker positive instances? Is dealing with some weirdo nerdy tech-guys who act like puritans on the federated timeline somehow *more* of a problem, than congregating on a website that is deteriorating on a daily basis, as the [infrastructure crumbles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/12/trump-returns-x-elon-musk-interview/){:target="_blank"} as if being eaten alive by termites? Than congregating on a website where people will hurl slurs at you, and experience *no consequences whatsoever*?

No, I don't think it is.

Jokes aside, what I *want* to do, is show you some Mastodon/fediverse instances you can join in order to continue your work, whatever that may be, *without* indirectly supporting a dunce who hasn't genuinely created anything in his life and has benefited from the exploitation of working people since the day he was born.

So, here are some of those instances you can check out that are either LGBTQ+/Queer and sex worker friendly, or simply LGBTQ+/Queer friendly, free from the tendrils of [Bluesky's corporate board](https://www.nova-prime.net/social%20media/2024/07/31/bluesky-part-3-all-your-data-are-belong-to-us.html), who've recently partnered with a company that utilizes OpenAI, and the [Thread's public policy](https://www.nova-prime.net/social%20media/2024/07/30/threads-project-2025.html) maker, who coincidentally is also an author on Project 2025.

***Note: Some of these instances are not hosted on the Mastodon client, rather some on Misskey, or Akkoma, and other pieces of custom fediverse software. This does not take away from the experience, and I encourage you to check them all out, regardless.***

- [mkultra.monster](){:target="_blank"} :: Obviously, I'm going to put my instance on here first, because it's been running since February (2024), and it is and always *has been* LGBTQ+ and sex worker friendly, and it will stay that way. Even if I remain the *only actually active user* (queue laughing-crying emoji).

- [tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/about){:target="_blank"} :: queer friendly, not sure rules on sex work (the admin reached out to comment that sex work and NSFW content is fine, as long as proper content warnings are used) but i know artists do commissions and stuff on there so it should be fine‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, ran by a couple of administrators but I'm most familiar with [@ShadowJonathan@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@ShadowJonathan){:target="_blank"}

- [kinkycats.org](https://kinkycats.org/about){:target="_blank"} :: an LGBTQ+ and sex positive instance, with proper content warnings, of course.

***Some other things to note:***

Some of these instances do not allow NSFW content, and that should be respected. All instances that *do* allow NSFW content **require** proper content warnings, so that those in the federated timeline, and even the local timeline, don't have to see things they don't feel like seeing. I realize this specific point *may* be a deal-breaker for some. But, if that's the case, *maybe* Twitter really is the only place you can be. But, honestly? Warning people about nudity, in the very least, is something ... everyone should be doing, *everywhere*. It's not about being prude, or puritans, but more about *social consent*.

I'll be keeping this list updated with new additions, or removals as needed. If your instance is here and you don't want it to be, please contact [me at my instance](https://mkultra.monster/@cmdr_nova){:target="_blank"}.
