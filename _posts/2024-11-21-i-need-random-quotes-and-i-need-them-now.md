Another little update before I call it a night and do something to rest my brain. I put together a random quote display thing for the top of my website here. Mine has a bunch of quotes from political figures, astronomers, and also Star Trek characters, and it shows them once per day using local storage and a timer. But, I put a simplified version on Github.

A friend wanted / needed this for something, and like I do, I obliged. So I simplified it down to just a random quote display that changes with every page refresh.

You can <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/RandoQuote" target="_blank">grab it here</a>, and use it however the heckle McGeckle you want.

Enjoy~
