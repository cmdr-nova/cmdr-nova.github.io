Hello good people of the indie-web, and shout-out to the fediverse! Why am I shouting out the fediverse? Surely they can't see what I'm typing here, right now? Oh, but what if they could? What if, after I share this update via my own Mastodon account, all replies to that post came directly to *this post*, here, on my website. Well, buddy, ol' pal. That's exactly what happens now.

Not only that, but as mentioned in my <a class="page-link" href="/pages/log/">changelog</a>, there is now a very simple Mastodon-share button under every single post.

Before I go any further, I want to credit both of the people here, who made this possible.

I'd like to thank [@autinerd@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@autinerd){:target="_blank"} for their really simple, and also extremely awesome [Mastodon share button](https://github.com/autinerd/simple-mastodon-share-button){:target="_blank"}, that works with a pop-up and requires no workarounds, whatsoever. And then I'd like to thank [@jwildeboer@social.wildeboer.net](https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer){:target="_blank"} for his quick and [easy guide](https://jan.wildeboer.net/2023/02/Jekyll-Mastodon-Comments/){:target="_blank"} to getting Mastodon comments to show up on your Jekyll site, with only a little bit of fiddling (which I don't mind, I write all of my posts in frikken' VS Code).

These things are *really* important, because ... if you haven't noticed, ActivityPub is *the future of the internet*. You can see Meta connecting Threads to our little corner of the internet, just so they can be part of it, and you see protocols like Nostr and ATP trying to do their own thing and ... kind of sort of missing the mark. The future of the internet is user hosted and user maintained. Which is funny. Because that's almost exactly what the internet was in 1995.

If there is an ActivityPub implementation that can be done with CSS and Javascript, you can bet your fluffy tail I'm going to put it onto this website. And I'm sure there's more, such as *syndicating every post* to my Mastodon account, without any *need* to share it manually. But that? I think I'll wait on that for another time, as today has been *very* busy in web development for me.

I also made the navigation hamburger a defined size, and scrollable, so that I can put as much crap in there as I want, and not burden your screen, whether you're browsing this on your clunky Debian laptop, or your shiny new iPhone 15, it should now be one uniform size. *Hopefully*.

Anyway, I just wanted to make an update on this, and hand out some thank-yous and corresponding links so that anyone else interested in doing these things, can easily find them.

Enjoy your weekends!
