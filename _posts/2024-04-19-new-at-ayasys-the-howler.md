<p>For years, and years, I've had a secondary store in Second Life. It was first named Horcrux Business Solutions, when its only products were some adboards and an online indicator. Sometime a few years ago, I noticed that, although small, and mostly unknown, it <em>does</em> make sales here and there. So, I decided it should have a new name, and a rebranding.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enter: Ayashi Systems (AyaSys), a division of [REVOSA].</p>

<p>AyaSys gives me the ability to do things a little differently, and freshly!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And today, for the first time since its inception in 2016, AyaSys receives a new product! </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Backrooms inspired, entire static 3D model of the Howler Entity. This is not scripted, has no sounds, and is not animated. It'll be perfect for your horror sims, or just for decorating your home! The model is copy and modify, so you <em>can</em> script it, and sound it ... if you really wanna do that, and only costs you 250 linden!</p>
