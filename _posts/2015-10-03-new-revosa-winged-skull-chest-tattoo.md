New today, the REVOSA Winged Skull Chest tattoo! Perfect for those who enjoy the darker side of life, or feel as though they're constantly balancing good and evil! But that's subjective anyway, right?<br />
<br />
Included in the pack is a classic tattoo layer and a Maitreya applier HUD.<br />
<br />
Next on my list is to make this chest tattoo and the recent sleeves that I did combined, so that you don't have to fiddle with multiple layers and masking issues on your avatar. Enjoy!<br />
