Today I bring you a pair of 100% mesh headphones for your head! These are non-rigged and they come with an easy peasy color change HUD.<br />
<br />
This particular item was made for the November Firestorm free hunt thing but as usual with applying to be part of something dominated by super big-time developers, I heard nothing in return. Therefore I'm selling them!<br />
<br />
They're also a cool 1 land impact for those who might want to use them as desk props or whatever without worrying about it swallowing up your entire parcel!<br />
