<p>This isn't going to be a very long post, as I don't feel it's a good idea to delve too much into the details of the inner-workings of my brother's relationship, or lack-thereof with his wife, soon to be ex. But I want to put this out there as a call-to-action, why?</p>

<p>Recently, or, a little over a week ago, my brother's wife, with whom he's been married for years now, walked out on him. She walked out on him and left him with both of their children, and then took their car. The same car he was using in order to get to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of now, he's left with no car, and also no job, because he needs to take care of his children, and cannot afford childcare (especially not now).</p>

<p>This Gofundme is fundraising for a car, and spending related to parental duties.</p>

<p>Any amount will help.</p>
