Have you been on the brink of purchasing these cybernetic legs but were totally uncertain if they'd fit you? Well now you can try a demo!<br />
<br />
Along with the demo, please feel free to send me an IM inworld with questions about the product and issues you might be having with fitting. I am usually pretty busy but I will do my best to help you.<br />
<br />
The demo is freely available on the marketplace or on any of my vendors!<br />
