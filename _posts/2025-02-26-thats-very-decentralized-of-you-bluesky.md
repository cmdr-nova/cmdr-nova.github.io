You've probably heard it by now, or have seen my *many* posts on here about Bluesky, and their false claims of decentralization, or of what kind of social network they're even *trying to be.* From their blockchain, crypto investors, to the extreme right-wing accounts they refuse to moderate: Welcome to Twitter 2: The Reckoning.

What I'm writing about today, is more on that same subject, and also in regard to someone I once looked up to.

I have kind of a ... complicated history, in regard to Parker Molloy. Back on Twitter, almost ten years ago at this point, I was kind of a hopeful writer who wanted to be like her. I wanted to write for publications and make *that* my career. In retrospect, I still think it would be cool if that happened.

But ... I wrote some kind of "article" piece on my website at the time, which was just some hacky Wordpress looking thing, about an LGBTQ+ topic (I don't even remember anymore what that topic was), and then I shared it with her. I guess I was hoping to get some kind of notable mention, or a foot-in-the-door toward what I wanted to do.

Instead, she quoted my post, and called it "Mostly hyperbole, with grains of truth." To which I was made fun of, and heckled by her followers.

Flash forward, it's 2025, and I'm quoting Parker Molloy from her Bluesky account, where she's pointing out that the one and singular moderation team behind Bluesky has completely removed a post from being viewed by *the entire network*.

<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:hf7ezrajxadu7v3tzcyij424/app.bsky.feed.post/3lj3uxy6ohs23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidabkqnp3uiuigwezilj6esiqy5dtth7f4t6yz675hfpekmafbphq"><p lang="en">It&#x27;s clearly newsworthy.

So, it seems to *look like* the Bluesky moderation is protecting Donald Trump's interests, and proving even more-so, that the people behind Bluesky understand "decentralization" much in the same way Bitcoin investors do: They don't.

The content of the video is questionable, of course. It ... well, *is* an explicit, non-consensual generation, deep-fake, AI ... *thing*.

The question is: Should anyone give a shit? Should anyone *give two shits* when this kind of thing is targeting two people who are absolutely tearing down and devastating not just the entire United States, but the *world*, at-large?

No.

Is it *newsworthy*, does it *matter*, according to Parker, if it remains on the platform? I think it's actually *more* newsworthy that Bluesky has, over, and over again, shown their real colors, by continuing to protect the interests of *fascists*.

So, in that respect, yeah, it *does* matter that they took it down.

It matters that an alleged twenty to thirty million people continue to use this network, despite *all of the evidence* that they shouldn't, while an *actual* decentralized solution is directly in front of all of them. And their excuses for not distancing themselves from fascist venture capitalists, range from "I don't like nerd shit" and "Choosing servers is hard."

Well, I think, at this point, the bed's made, isn't it?

Yeah, I have an account on Bluesky, where I'm mostly feeding RSS updates. Just like I have a *mostly* inactive account on Threads where I occasionally log on to see if the influencers, who don't talk to anyone, are still complaining about nobody interacting with them.

But, like I do, each time that Bluesky fucks up, I'll provide a link here to a site where you can decide for yourself, if you'd like to <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net/?lang=en-us" target="_blank">join the ActivityPub network</a>.
