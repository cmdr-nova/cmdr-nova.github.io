Months, and months, and months ago, I started making a really simple space flight game that I wanted to be like Elite. And then I found out that making a game exactly like Elite is actually extremely hard, and takes a very long time (I work a full time job that pretty much puts me to sleep the second I walk in the door at home, which leaves me with hardly any time to mess with code). I put the Python version of ETERNAL down, and let it roast, seemingly, *forever*. But then, I, more recently, thought, "What if it was just a simple space thing you do in JavaScript, and you put it in your website?"

So I did that.

You can try out ETERNAL, <a href="/eternal/eternal.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It's ... a little janky? The power consumption needs work, the refueling is kind of just like, "Okay here's more fuel." And on mobile, it works fine! Except ... the power consumption appears to only sporadically work.

Never-the-less, you can try it out, and also listen to soma.fm while you play.

There is no end-goal, there are no objectives.

The only point is to fly through infinite space while enjoying some music. Maybe we can call it, a self-care space exploration game, in JavaScript.
