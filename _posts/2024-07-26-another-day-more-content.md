Today, I struggled with myself to push through my final day of work for the week, so that I can come home to my *one day off* until I go back to work on Sunday! But, with the prospect of having a little bit of extended time to myself, I dedicated an entire evening, and partial late-night into adding mountains of content, and *placeholders* for content to this website. If you look to the top right, whether you're on mobile or desktop, you'll notice the navigation bar has become a constant hamburger menu. This is the way it should be, as I have many, many links. And the only way it could possibly break and not be a hamburger, is if you're using a massive resolution scale on desktop, and ... at that point. I dunno, brother. 

But this is the nature of web development. Getting everything in-place where I want it, and how I want it, and then improving, and changing, and updating from there.

Speaking of! In that little hamburger menu, you'll notice a link called "log," where you can read about changes I've made on a particular date, starting with today. I've, thankfully, decided to omit the past couple of days where I spent *most* of my time struggling with pagination. This is not a needed note to the changelogs.

I've also added a page describing my thoughts and feelings on the farce of "AI," and the "why" as to why you *should* have a website, especially in this day and age of destructive corporate social media and possible ridiculous admins on random fediverse instances (something I am unfortunately very familiar with). And then I finished it off with a flavor-page depicting the default apps I like to use for different things within the technology that I employ in my day-to-day life.

But that's what this website is about ... Me!

I was a little wary yesterday, thinking, "Oh man, oh geez, I just *deleted* my Wordpress site, and jumped to this with no plan whatsoever, like some kind of impulsive teenager." But it's working out! I've already put up *probably* more content than I ever would have on a restrictive Wordpress setup, and, with how the company itself is going all-in on this AI bubble, I'm sorta glad to remove myself from their influence, entirely.

I've also, *finally* put out some sort of update on my Patreon, in regard to this website, and what I've been doing. I try to remember and make space/time to do this, because it is, after-all, a place where people support what I do. I've had the thing, I think, since 2013. Which, come to think of it, reminds me that I should plug that [here](https://www.patreon.com/cmdr_nova){:target="_blank"}. I do all sorts of things, from music, to video, to streaming, to web development, and hey, I even run a [Mastodon instance](https://mkultra.monster/about){:target="_blank"}! Head over to my Patreon, sign up, and you'll even get access to a Discord where I talk sometimes.

But, anyway, thanks for reading!
