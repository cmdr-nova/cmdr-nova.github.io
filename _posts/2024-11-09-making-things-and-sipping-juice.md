The day's coming to an end (okay, actually, it's like 12:30 at night, it's been over), and I've done *a lot*. In my last post I talked about spending all of my free time over the course of 24 hours making a function that pushes my blog posts to Mastodon. Well, after all of that, I went to bed, woke up, and started on something new ...

Almost half of my day was spent fixing and upgrading the <a class="page-link" href="/pages/haxpunks/">haxPunks</a> page on this website.

Basically, I noticed that the image modal was not only opening *within* its parent div (main), but also producing a scrollbar WITHIN that div, and it was very clunky and *bad* looking. So, the goal was to figure out a better way to do it. And then I stumbled into problems, where I had a position set in one of the CSS elements, and because of that *one freakin' thing*, the modal *would not stop* opening and showing on page load.

This *also* looked bad.

And it took me HOURS to notice what I did wrong.

But I fixed it.

And I got the modal functioning correctly.

And I formatted it to work nicely on mobile (I think).

Then, it was *done*.

After that, I took a look at what is now the <a class="page-link" href="/pages/second-life/">Second Life</a> page, and decided to delete everything I'd written in there, and made something new. It showcases my store, and then my land. No big story about where I came from, where I'm going, how things went wrong, and where we're at now.

Just the stuff that currently exists. Which is good, I think. So people don't have to read a history book about why I've done what I've done, and what my goals are.

But I wasn't finished after that. I *needed* to do more.

I took to Gimp, opened OBS, and recorded my process of making a haxPunk, and then uploaded the video, plus the result (to the haxPunks page). Yes, you will notice in the video there's a "generative" layer, and that's entirely because this is a PSD from when I was still subscribed to Photoshop, and *totally* innocently looking at what exactly the feature did (lol).

But, here's that video:

And here's the punk:

As you can probably tell, I've modeled this one after the current version of my Second Life avatar, and I think it turned out pretty neat. 

I've been making these things since *before* I said, "Wait a minute, NFTs are stupid." But the thing is, I *enjoyed* the process of making them so much, that even *after* exiting the whole "NFT" thing, I wanted to keep making them. I've had these going for a *long* time, and I want to make *hundreds* of them. Just for fun.

Lately, that's pretty much the reason I do *most* things. On my website, on Github, or through Python on my VPS. I just enjoy doing this stuff!

If at some point I happen to get paid to do any of it, hey, that's awesome (please pay me to do these things at some point oh my god please).

Just kidding

... unless?
