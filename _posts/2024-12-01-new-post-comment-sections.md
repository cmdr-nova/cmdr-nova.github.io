I pretty much have zero time to write a fully comprehensive post, because it took an hour and a half to figure out how to do this, and *now I have to get ready for work*. But! Each post on the website here now has a dedicated comment section that bounces off of a proxy server at my VPS. This means, that comments must be made *on-site*, but I've included an option to allow users to enter their fedi username.

In order to show your fediverse username and have it link to your account, follow the example in the input field, e.g., @username@fediverse.server and then when you post a comment, the JavaScript will build a link from that information.

And, your comments are saved on my server! Voila!

Okay, time for work.
