What do you do when you have a day off from work? Do you play some viddygames? Do you go outside and roll around in the grass, praying you don't accidentally slob around in some poopoo? Well, that's *not* what I do. Today, I sat down in front of my computer screen, chugged an energy drink as my heart screamed at me "Please, for the love of pizza and beer, stop the caffeine!" and I said, "What if I filled out every single link in the nav section?"

And that's what I did, good ol' pal, o' whoever the **heck** you are.

It started with simple things, such as adding my "daily carry" page that shows off the random crap I hold on my person when I'm out and about. Funny story about that bag in the photo, I got that off of thinkgeek back in 2011, before they were shutdown and ... seemingly replaced with a forward to the near-defunct Gamestop. *That wasn't what I expected to find, and this sucks immeasurably.*

Afterward, I added a "today I learned" section, for random things I learn on a daily basis, a "share" link for people to share my website more easily to ActivityPub enabled servers, a pod and blogroll, for blogs I read, and podcasts I listen to (which I recommend you check out!), and other small things, like the "someday" page where I talk about things I'd like to do someday (like, own a house!).

Bigger additions you might find will be the [REVOSA] page where I semi-detail the story behind my Second Life store. The discography page, where I list *every single* musical release I've *ever* made, and provide links to the Patreon member download for each of them. The books I've published through Smashwords (now owned by Draft2Digital), and then a "why" section, detailing why I think *you* and everyone else should have a personal website (you know, instead of just posting everything you've ever done on fickle social media websites).

In the "other" section, you'll find my former NFT project, haxPunks (something I do for fun every once in a while, now), the resurrection of my "how to second life" guide, my Dungeons and Dragons characters, fanfiction I've started and never finished, and a little "scrap" page of my favorite characters in games I've played throughout the years.

All-in-all, I've turned Nova Prime into *an actual* webpage, that far expands beyond what I had on Wordpress, and brings back some of what was lost when I stopped updating the original version of Nova Prime.

After setting up, and then completing the initial build of the *entire site*, I actually find myself struggling to think of a reason as to why I ever switched to self-hosting Wordpress. Jekyll is completely fine for writing posts, *and* it makes you feel like a hacker. Because you have to write everything either in a console, or via a text editor (I use VS Code).

Now ... if I could figure out a way to give the website some kind of "follow" button, outside of providing a link to the auto-generated feed XML at the bottom of the main page.
