**Now playing** : *Eclipse - Perturbator*

Struggling on a lot of days lately to think of both something I *want* to write, and also want to write, and *keep*. I haven't really been slacking, just ... brain-jumbled for ideas. I also want to make more little short videos for my Tiktok and Instagram. But, another thing I want to do, is start using these blog updates on my website to address [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cmdr_nova){:target="_blank"}, considering I *do* still have somewhat of an audience there.

I'm always writing here, *anyway*, and I like to keep things ... in a singular place, as much as I possibly can.

So, anyway.

***[REVOSA] MOVES***

In my last update, I mentioned that I was finally deciding to shutter Neo Machina (at least, for the foreseeable future), and that my store would move to its own parcel where it would stand in perpetuity, or until something bigger comes along.

That location, is [here](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Jieut/25/202/2008){:target="_blank"}.

I haven't really made anything for my store in quite a while, but a lot of that has to do with creative energy, and the absolute vampire that my offline job is. But, like everything else, there's *still* more stuff coming!

***Patreon & Apple Issues***

On the topic of Patreon, [Apple](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218629/patreon-membership-ios-30-percent-apple-tax){:target="_blank"} will soon begin taking a 30% cut from patrons who subscribe to *any* Patreon page via the iOS app. As much as I like Apple tech, and the Apple stuff that *I own*, this is kind of an unfortunate update to things. I don't know *how many* people actually subscribe via the Patreon app, but you *may* want to consider switching your subscriptions to the desktop site.

It just blows my mind, a multi-billion dollar company that mostly dominates the tech market as Microsoft commits multiple self-owns in the course of a couple of months, and yall'st guys really gotta go rent-seeking *this hard*?

It's a fluster buck.

I've opted to simply increase tier prices via the iOS Patreon app, because *I refuse* to pay their fees. And I, again, *highly* recommend you do not subscribe to my content via the app on your phone.

***THE MAMMOTH***

On the topic of iOS, today I discovered a new(ish?) iOS Mastodon app. If you're on an iPhone, and you use Mastodon as frequent as you used to use Twitter, I would *highly* recommend downloading the Mammoth app. **Especially** if you're new to Mastodon, and wanting easier ways to connect with people, and find the content you might enjoy seeing. I recommend this app for that, because it makes bringing content to your timeline *much easier* than any other app I've ever seen. *For real*.

Also, the developers seem to have taken a little inspiration from the Bluesky UI, in that they've built in tabs that you can use to craft *your own feeds*, or feeds of special interests you may have. This is *definitely* something Mastodon has needed for a *long* time.

I *love* the fediverse, but one of the biggest issues I've always experienced while navigating it, is that it's still ... *really* tough to find things I *want* to read, and see. That's not to say I don't enjoy seeing the people on my timeline. I do! But I've always wanted to also see *more* tech, *more* linux, *more* gaming, and so on and so forth.

Mammoth makes that *much* simpler.

Go [download it](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mammoth-for-mastodon/id1667573899){:target="_blank"}, immediately.

***Other STUFF***

Aside from all of that ...

I've decided that in continuing to compose music for my next album, I think I want to keep using my Macbook for that. Using FL Studio on Linux has been *real* hacky, and on my Macbook I just ... already have everything setup for what I normally do.

As for the book, Dissolution Protocol, I'm starting to feel like I could continue writing that, again. We'll see.

To my patrons on Patreon, I will continue uploading exclusive content for those who are paying to be there. But I definitely feel like I want to keep my public updates, here, on my *website*. It just makes more sense to me. Patreon has never felt like a real kind of viable platform for blogging. These things are much better when you're doing it on your own website, and writing both the content, and the *code*.

I hope all's well with all yall'st, and be sure to subscribe to the RSS feed if this is your first time here. I'll be keeping updates going, and if you're in the Discord server, you'll see them pop each time I upload a new post, in the blog-updates channel.

Anyway, peace, chooms!
