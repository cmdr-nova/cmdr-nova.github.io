My second release for today, and at a much more "natural" time, is the "black" tank top.<br />
<br />
Tired of other colors usurping the heir to the throne of darkness? Now you can tell the world how you feel about that with this lady's tank top!<br />
<br />
This top, like my others, comes in six sizes! Extra extra small, extra small, small, medium, large and extra large. If for some reason <i>none</i> of these fit you, I would be more than happy to help out! My customer's happiness is important, afterall.<br />
