<p>It was four years ago, everything was pretty normal, or as normal as normal could be on Twitter (or, at least, nearer to the end of Twitter's life, before it became an X). Maybe some people followed and watched Dr. Disrespect. Maybe some synthwave creators who fancied themselves part of some obscure, secret boys club, were in his Discord building an exclusive playlist. And maybe some people hated him for his abrasive, sometimes homophobic or transphobic words, and actions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And maybe some people remember his first ban, which came after he filmed within a bathroom at TwitchCon.</p>

<p>The second ban came in 2020, with nothing but an enormous amount of secrecy, that erupted literal conspiracy theories about what <em>actually</em> happened.</p>

<p>After a day of silence, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/06/27/dr-disrespect-finally-breaks-his-silence-on-twitch-ban-and-its-not-good/#1a867b7f3526">Disrespect has made only a brief statement on Twitter</a>, saying that Twitch has not notified him of any reasoning behind the ban. In the days since he was banned, speculation has run rampant throughout social media, but there has been no official word or credible leaks about why this ban happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twitch has yet to specify a reason or speak about Disrespect specifically. The company‚Äôs only statement has been a vague update regarding community guidelines and terms of service:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.‚Äù</p>

<p>And now, four years later, we finally know why he was banned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Disrespect exchanged inappropriate messages with a minor via Twitch's own software.</p>

<p>Just after publishing the above piece, Dr. Disrespect <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">issued a lengthy statement</a>, admitting to inappropriate messages with a minor, though he denies that it involved anything illegal and pushes back against accusations that he is a predator.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>‚ÄúWere there twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017?‚Äù Beahm writes. ‚Äú The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why it took <em>this long</em> for word to finally come out. Maybe Guy, or Twitch, thought the heat would die down enough that it wouldn't kick up so much dust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I think they were wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, Beahm is a predator, despicable. And I'm willing to bet what he details happened is probably the light beer version of what really happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bigger question, I think, is <em>why did Twitch keep this a secret, and why did they pay him</em>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twitch <em>had</em> these details, they <em>knew</em> what happened, and they kept it under wraps for <em>four years</em>. A website that's supposed to be rock solid, open to all, <em>safe</em>. ... kept a secret about a prominent streamer contacting a minor, inappropriately, on their <em>own website</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uh, guys?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think Twitch kinda fucked up here. I mean, maybe they were wrapped up in all this legality that Beahm keeps talking about, but you WOULD THINK, maybe ... They'd come out and be like, "Yeah, he did this. That's why we banned him." You know, four years ago. I don't know, maybe there's more to it than that, but if I were in-charge, I don't think I'd keep secrets for the man.</p>
