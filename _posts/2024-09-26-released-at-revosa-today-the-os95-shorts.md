Today, following the end of the month-long shopping event at the Progeny Mall, the Nano Nexus (OS95 Edition) shorts are now available at the store! These shorts continue a bit of a rejuvenated desire to keep my store running, by at least releasing something new *once a month*. As it turns out, pumping things out every other day was only ever really possible when I was without offline work.

<a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">Drop on by the store</a> within Second Life and check them out! Or, if you're busy, in a jam, or generally unable to be in Second Life right this moment, you can see them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-OS95-Edition/26431919" target="_blank">marketplace page</a>.

You might notice that the store location has changed *again*, but let me explain. The current location is a backup that I've had for a little over a month, in the event that I would have to move from the location that was provided to me. It turns out, I unfortunately have to do that. I attribute no fault to Logan, and I extend my deepest gratitude for being allowed to use the land he had in order to host my store. It's not every day you meet someone in Second Life who's willing to offer a helping hand.

Thankfully, this won't really affect the store, because it'll now just be at my fully Backrooms/Pool Rooms themed location. And although the size may be deceiving, I actually have plenty of *space* to work with.

And to all of the frequent shoppers, and those who have continued to shop from, and visit [REVOSA] for nearly ten years going, *thank you*.
