I've written a lot about how much I miss the 90s, and sometimes pine for an age in the 80s, and, obviously, I'm not talking ... politically. But more, a time when things were less chaotic, and we were all kinda just vibing with whatever was happening. Drinking our Ecto-Coolers, slipping on Velcro sneakers, uh, watching Rocko's Modern Life.

But sometimes I also wish it was still 2012. Still in the midst of the Mass Effect trilogy, the greatest game series *ever created*. Still logging onto a *mostly* normal Facebook to get my daily clicks in Mafia Wars and Farmville.

A time when Sims 3 was the latest and greatest of the franchise, and *all I was doing* in the game was walking my sim around collecting diamonds and rocks, and trying to figure out what kind of bathroom she should have. When I was still mystified by new experiences, and finding wonder in exploring new narratives. Back when the iPhone still had what I think were the best icon graphics, a headphone jack, and iPods! Yeah, I had an iPod Touch! ...that I played digital poker with.

When I'd jump on Google cam-chats with friends, lay in bed, and just talk all night long, and when Youtube was just a place where people uploaded random weird stuff that wasn't designed to pull you in and keep you there for ad-rolls and sponsored segments.

... when cigarettes only cost like, four dollars a pack.

A year wherein I'd get out of work and still have the energy to *do things that I enjoy*.

I miss 2012.

There's no use living in the past, but there were *a lot* of great things about technology in the 90s, and 2000s, and even 2010. And then suddenly it all started going downhill. Things *advanced*, but for *no reason*. Oh boy, bigger cameras, larger screens, thinner bezels, s ... streaming? I don't *own* my music and movies anymore? All the casual games I liked using to pass time are on my phone? Sweet! ... oh, almost *all of them* are copies of each other and filled with so much money-grubbing they could only really be classified as a game for the first 5 minutes that you interact with it?

Instagram is about posting engagement-bait and getting popular with short-form content until you can ... get sponsored with product placement?

Twitter got murdered by Elon Musk and now it's just nazis and ai-gen spam?

What the *heck*?

***I miss 2012.***

It's not all bad. We got Mastodon, we got a federated network of users taking ownership of their content, and the indie web (a revival of the 90s internet). There are still *good* games out there, and a whole lot of indie developers who make some real gems. But, *man*, do you really have to sift through mountains and oceans of garbage to find content and entertainment *actually worth consuming*.

Or, maybe I'm just getting older, and everything is just *fine* the way it is.

Who knows.
