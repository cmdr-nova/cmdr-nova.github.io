<p>Sometimes I save Jetpack writing prompts as drafts so that I have something to write about later, should I feel so inclined. Obviously, if I <em>want</em> to be writing, I <em>should</em> be writing more for my book (Dissolution Protocol) that I haven't touched in four months. But, it takes a certain mood for me to be able to get into the state of mind that I need for writing fiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That out of the way, how've I adapted to the changes brought on by the pandemic? It depends on what changes you mean? Have I learned to deal with most drivers on the road becoming <em>more</em> aggressive than they were pre-2020? You can't tell me that you, as a driver, haven't noticed it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've definitely adapted to most smaller gas stations suddenly closing at nine or ten in the evening every single day, for who knows what reason, post-2022. Of all the things you might need in an instant, or suffer being stranded, a <em>gas station is one of them</em>. But I've learned to plan around my gas tank, and figure out which places are open should I need to fill up late at night.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's seriously as though half the world has chosen to ignore that <em>not everyone works a cushy nine to five desk job</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that's always the most evident at the end of each week when the normals holler out, "IT'S FRIDAY!"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think, if I could say I've adapted to anything, it is the idea that any one of us could be gone tomorrow. It's not an idea that's far-fetched. It's not something you can really scoff at anymore and go, "Yeah, okay. But not <em>me.</em>"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And everyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn't even have to be covid. It could be a car accident, it could be a consequence of murder or abduction. It could be because a guy in the supermarket was mad about his tomatoes being rotten, and because aggression is something gripping this country by the neck, he could whip out a gun and go postal. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be, just because it was your time to go. It could happen while you're sleeping, you could suddenly slump over at work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could happen at any time, anywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I think that's something the pandemic has really drilled into my head. So much so, I still struggle with ... finding my sense of self, ever since then. Every couple of months I feel like I'm trying on new personalities, trying to figure out what I like most, where I belong, who I am--before it's too late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like, I'm kicking myself every single day that I don't have my next book finished. But the drive isn't there, so I don't do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like the clock in my head says it's ticking, it's melting away, and you're still not married, you still don't have children, and you can't even muster a proper conversation on a <em>dating app.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's the feeling of impending doom, I think, that I've adapted to most. With nothing more than the feeling of just being ... numb to it.</p>
