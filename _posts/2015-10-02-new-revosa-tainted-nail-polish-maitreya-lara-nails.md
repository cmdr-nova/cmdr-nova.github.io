Brand new to REVOSA is the start of the Maitreya nail polish accessory line!<br />
<br />
This particular iteration of nail polish is pastel pink with one nail on each hand and foot appearing black, thus the name "tainted."<br />
<br />
Along with nail polish, I'll also be doing lipstick... As soon as TMP gets back to me about my creator application and the dev kit I need in order to make lipstick installers. Assuming they accept me, I'll also do lipstick, eyeliner and eyeshadow. But we'll see how that goes!<br />
