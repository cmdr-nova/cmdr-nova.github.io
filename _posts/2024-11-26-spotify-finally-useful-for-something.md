As some may know, I have *very many* releases under the musical id Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and have also started a side-project named PLEXX. While the muse for which I use to create has been a very slow monster, I've started to notice that ever since I basically rebuilt my life, I haven't really shared any of it that much. This is true for a lot of things I do, *except for these scripts* I've been making lately. So, let's fix that.

I already have an automated account on my Mastodon instance that I use for sharing random things cycled via Python scripts on my VPS, but what if we used it to share random songs from all of my releases?

And that, we have done.

Unfortunately, I *can't* use Bandcamp. Because Bandcamp won't let you scrape artist pages with a script, and if you're going to use a browser in headless mode to achieve the same thing (and make it work), you need the server where you're running that script to *actually allow you to do that*.

... which I cannot do at Digital Ocean (the chromium driver needed to do this is either inaccessible, or non-existent).

So!

Even though I absolutely *do not use* Spotify, due to their negligence of artists, and *paying them*, it is *at least* a public app that can be accessed and even listened to by pretty much anyone. As much as I prefer Apple Music, that random people can't really just open a link and listen, is kind of an issue. And, I also am not sure if Apple Music has a readily available API.

Which Spotify does.

So, the app that hates the artists that make it the revenue it needs to continue operating, is unfortunately the avenue we're going to take, until there's something better.

And, voila.
