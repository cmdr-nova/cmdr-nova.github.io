In continuing my new trend of just yapping, I wanted to point out something that I've been kind of enjoying lately (especially since quality Backrooms Youtube content has kind of dried up for me). That thing being, Minecraft ARGs, or "alternate reality games." Wherein, some user will post, or say they're "reposting" something from over a decade ago, of a strange series of videos, from a near vacant Youtube account. And then as you watch said videos, there's a string of creepy, horrific, or sad things that happen as this "Youtuber" plays through Minecraft (and each video will usually have clues or hidden links, etc).

You might be thinking, "The hell? You're almost 40, right? Minecraft is for KIDS!"

Maybe you're not thinking that.

But, I *do* think it sometimes, to myself. Mostly, because I was an alpha-buy-in for the original Minecraft, and I have definitely noted the extreme family-friendly shift the game made over the last decade. Not that this is *hugely* a problem, or anything. I still very much enjoy logging onto my realm and figuring out how exactly to make my base not be really basic and boring.

Anyway!

There are two Minecraft ARGs that really stick out to me as extremely well done. At least, of what I've watched so far. But, I don't go through the whole game of picking through videos, and figuring out what's going on. I just watch someone do it for me.

But, the first one isn't really an ARG, it's more like a short film.

And it's great.

This one is a dive into a short Minecraft film called "ABANDONED." Which is in the style of something of a "let's play" sort of deal, except the player's Minecraft world is ... haunted. With commentary from the Youtube channel, trone(y)sauce (because this is how *I* stumbled upon it, and I didn't really object to having commentary and a dissection of what happened).

Now, this didn't really scare me or anything, it was just *really* interesting to watch. Because, I've never seen people do things like this with Minecraft.

I thought it was all just semi-weird-ish adults doing exaggerated Let's Plays for kids.

I was wrong.

After you're done watching that one, you *absolutely have* to watch, "My Minecraft World is Deleting Itself ..."

This one *is* an ARG, and I also watched it from another Youtuber's perspective, as they themselves explain all of the details. And, this one isn't really scary or anything either. It's, actually, a really sad story.

But, I'll let you watch it and figure out for yourself if you can come to the conclusion on what it's about before Wifies explains it for you, at the end.

Again, this is content that's just revolving around Minecraft. I would have never expected to find things like this, and I can't wait to see if there's anymore!
