Today, I'm taking a prompt from the old Jetpack app that I've had installed on my phone ever since I still ran a Wordpress blog. It's a pretty useless app, now, but there are at least some ideas for things to write about. Although, I'm *almost certain* there are probably easier ways to get daily writing prompts in order to fuel my need to write things. Never-the-less, today's prompt is all about just ... describing your dream home. As a millennial, this is a pipe-dream. A far-away thing that will likely never happen. But, if I could *somehow* have a home, that I own, what would it be, really?

There is, *of course*, the old haunted house I lived in when I was sixteen, that I've always thought would be *really cool* to buy, and then renovate, and take care of. But, it's not really my *dream* home. It's more like, a link to the past that I could actively live inside of, as if that would provide some level of comfort as the past, and the way things used to be, gets further and further away from me.

It would make me think of things like, hanging out the window in my room late at night smoking a cigarette. Sitting in front of my hand-me-down 486 choosing a cool anime wallpaper for my desktop. My highschool girlfriend picking me up for school in her jalopy of a car, and the one time I accidentally sleepily dialed 911 when I was trying to call her (to ask how far away she was).

*That was one hell of a morning, having an ambulance outside wondering what the shit was happening, and my Dad outside, just as confused.*

Maybe ... maybe, it wouldn't be *that* great of an idea to live in a place that makes me think of things, and the ways I was, that will never be, ever again. I learned that a couple of months ago when I wrote to that aforementioned highschool ex-girlfriend, and sort of poured out my feelings and thoughts as to why I couldn't be just some side-thing, like she wanted, twenty years after abandoning what I thought would be the rest of my life, at the time.

She didn't answer.

And that's probably for the best.

So, if we're talking a *real* dream home, I think I'd go out somewhere, maybe in the midwest, far away from the bustle of *other people*. I'd go out into the woods and drop down maybe two shipping containers, and I'd have them conditioned for living. There'd be water nearby, so that I could fish whenever I want, and I'd have a studio for gaming and working on all the things that I do on a daily basis. The outside would be covered in camouflage nets and black paint, and the inside would be a sort of ... rustic gothic.

Sword collections, a battle-axe over a side table. Another shelf on the opposite side of the living area showcasing all the little game and anime figures I've collected over the years. In the center, a gigantic flat-screen television and whatever the latest and best console is.

The kitchen would be a wood-burning stove with ventilation connected to the outside, but there'd also be a modern fridge with temperature display and voice-activated features. But all the smart tech in my home would be running on a reverse proxy that redirects their tracking software to some other location.

The bathroom would have one of those rich-person walk-in showers that you just kind of, stand in while water falls on top of you in kind of an open concept where the sink and toilet are just kinda, right there, *also*.

But, there'd be a more private bathroom tucked at the back of the master, and *only* bedroom. Of course, the bed itself would be made out of top-of-the-line memory foam and down-feather sheets or whatever, and there'd be a gigantic glass window in the ceiling that looks out into the stars at night.

Maybe it'd be smart, so I could dim it, or blend it with the ceiling during the day.

There would be a security system surrounding the property, and all of this would be connected to a secondary PC in my studio, with alarms, and footage that's all saved to my home server, that'd be tucked away in a large walk-in closet. A home server that also has built-in custom water-cooling, and the best of the best technology. That all runs on Linux, *of course*.

The front door, and the *only* door, would be reinforced steel, along with the paneling on the outside. Indestructible and impervious to most things, including bullets, and maybe even a grenade.

Then, the best kept secret of my home, would be the bunker beneath all of it, filled with perishables, water, and whatever amenities one might need in the event that *something* happens. Zombies, nukes, the Night of the Walking Entitled Rich People, whatever. I'll be ready.

I wouldn't have a car. I wouldn't need it. There'd be a secure mailing box at the edge of the woods where my actual address would be, and I'd just order whatever I need, at all times. Imagine ordering a burger on Doordash and you're like, "Just drop it off at the big huge box on the side of the road."

And maybe ... *that* could be a dream home. A dream home that's also future-proof, and ready for disaster.

Maybe it sounds like a prepper's dream, and that's kinda funny, cause I'm not really a doomsday prepper. But, if I *had the money*, maybe I **would** be. Who knows!
