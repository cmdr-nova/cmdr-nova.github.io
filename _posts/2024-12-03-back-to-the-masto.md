Much to probably nobody's surprise, I am *very* indecisive, and I can't figure out what I want to do. In my ActivityPub distro-hopping adventures, I've installed Mastodon onto a VPS, and switched back. Not because Sharkey is *bad*, or not to my liking. It's great! But I can't keep myself away from the Mastodon software. Even if Sharkey has some advantages over it.

Mastodon, for sure, isn't perfect. But I find myself having to think about *a lot less* when I'm running my own instance. In fact, I've done it so many times, I think it took me 20 minutes to setup the instance, and get everything configured correctly? Not that it was *hard* to setup Sharkey, but I'm getting good at this. My one issue with Sharkey, is that scaling means basically crippling your instance to have to reset all files for local and remote users to keep cache and bandwidth down, and without an automated way to do this, well. 

As you know, I am a tired person.

I have Mastodon running with a cron task that just kills media attachment cache once every 7 days, I have the database tuned to the correct stats for the server I'm running on Debian, and I'm storing all remaining media attachments on an S3 bucket.

Simple.

I'm finished.

I'm so tired my eye is twitching.

But I think this is where I'll stay for now.

I think.

That's the post, I'm sleepy again.
