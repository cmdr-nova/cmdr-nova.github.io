Nostr, the name of a social network that I really can't pinpoint the *theme* of. Like something a disgruntled Twitter developer came up with after trying Mastodon, and thought, "Hey, there aren't enough opportunities to pay for this?" And then there's the name, like it was definitely something thought up by a hipster sitting in a corporate lounge. 

But, you might be surprised (or perplexed?) to find out that it stands for, *Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays*. Mastodon *also* uses relays, but more as a way to connect people, and to ease the struggle of the slow slog of natural federation.

*If this is exactly what Nostr relays do, then ... Okay!*

Nostr, at least via Damus, has a Twitter-like environment, but also you can use it to blog, but also you can build a website and a merch store with it. All you have to do is have a ... bitcoin wallet, and some money.

Months back when I originally made an account on the iOS Nostr app, Damus, I logged on and said, "Saw this app being talked about, decided to jump in and see what's up. Hello! #introductions" and I got, honestly, a pretty warm welcome? I at least wasn't pelted with swastikas or anything that you might assume would happen on an unfettered and seemingly unmoderated social network.

Although, there was *just one* strange user who advised me that I should be anonymous, and that the goal isn't to be famous, which kind of felt threatening, in a way? Not that I haven't encountered some degree of angst on *every social network ever created* while being a "content creator." A creator who is definitely *not* famous, and more just doing these things for fun, as hobbies, until one day it *maybe* pays bills. But that's beside the point.

I'm not sure if said person meant any of that to be threatening, but asking immediate personal questions about what I do, what my skills are, and *why* I should stay anonymous was ... just weird.

And then there's this feature called "Zap" where other users can toss Satoshi coins at you for posting. That's also a bit strange, but I guess I won't really complain that I was given the equivalent of about 10 cents worth of Bitcoin for posting a few "hello" notes on Damus.

The potential to make real money by just posting online is, at least, intriguing. But, I'm not sure if this is really all that different from just having a Patreon in your profile links on Mastodon.

Now, you're probably thinking, "Okay, but where's the part where you gotta have some money?" I mean, first of all, giving people money for posting (completely optional), requires that you fund a BTC wallet. Which, I don't know how people really feel about cryptocurrency anymore in our current climate of things going on. What with AI driving the mass extinction of the human race, but I am *still* under the impression that operating on a crypto network is using up some kind of power fulfilled by Nvidia farms.

It *is* sort of a noble thought, though, from a social network: That people should and *can* be paid for posting, or for doing what they do, directly on the app, and quite effortlessly ...

But then I returned to Nostr today to see how things are going. Partially, because I saw some random person on my Mastodon timeline somehow commenting on a fediverse post, *from Nostr*, and I thought, "Alright, let's give this another look for a few minutes." 

*(If anyone can explain to me how someone from Nostr managed to federate into Mastodon, that'd be great.)*

I decided I didn't want to *just* view this via the Damus app on my phone, and then went off to explore web apps. And, o*h boy*.

Alright, so you need your public or private key from your original account. In my case, this is from Damus, and easy to find. So then you plug that into one of many apps available, all, I assume, developed by random independent developers. I searched around a bit and settled on this one called Snort. I just kind of liked how that sounded.

All's fine and dandy, until I start reading about how your profile and/or username should be verified on-chain so that it's less likely that someone impersonates you. So, like a blue check? In the profile settings, I have an address that was assigned to me via Damus (I think? I'm pretty sure I didn't make it up myself), and via Snort, that address is invalid.

So, I find the page via Snort that lets you "get" or register a new one.

Once you've navigated there, through their not-so-obvious link, you have the option to get one for free as a subdomain, but no matter what you do, even if it says the username is fine, you get an error. Error. Error. Error.

Then, the only other option is to buy one from Snort, or Iris (some kind of connected app, or network?) for the minimum price of around 30-35 dollars USD, but in BTC.

This is the part where I mentioned you'd have to have some cash. Albeit, I don't know if this is really *required*. It *seems* to be pretty much just the Nostr equivalent of paying for a blue check on Twitter, except I can't see why you'd want to do this on Nostr, because I, and I don't mean any offense to people who use this network, who are genuine people just trying to connect and have fun--But I don't know why anyone would do that on such an unknown, and niche network.

Sure, you can opt to support the developers, and that's fine. But, I also see a heavy degree of AI generated content on different feeds, including from the developers at Snort.

![Screenshot from a Nostr app showing mulitple different user avatars, most of which are AI generated.](/img/posts/nostr/gen.png)

*Snort also appears to default every avatar for unknown or new accounts to some variation of an AI generated person*

I have *very strong* opinions against AI generated content, and if you know me, you know I refuse to support anyone who uses this tech, at least, if I can help it.

Aside from the fact that this bubble is about to pop and everyone is due for a massive wake-up call, one that I'll be bringing the popcorn for: If you can't even *make your own avatar* on a social network (or, jesus christ, screenshot something from a movie or a game if you're not feeling inspired) ... I don't think I can trust that you're actually able to develop anything, at least ethically, you know, without contributing to the 115 degrees Fahrenheit heat and 80% humidity we're experiencing in certain parts of the US.

But, I have these exact issues with the developer of the Ice Cubes Mastodon app, where guy has payment options for his work, and loads up the app icons with a bunch of generated slop that is most certainly ripping people off.

If you're going to ask to be paid, even passively without requiring it, you *need* to get rid of the AI generated theft you're participating in. Use some of that money to hire an artist to spend maybe *a day* making you a few icons.

Now, the AI issue is one that is wide-spread, across every network, and I'm not sure if this is a bigger problem on Nostr, or if it's just people peoplin'. But *it is* worth pointing this out, especially if we're talking about developers developing things for monetary gain, and using theft-tech to visually represent themselves, or their products.

With all of that aside, *how does *the software perform? What does it *feel* like?

If you're using the Damus app, it feels about as stable as Bluesky. Definitely in need of polish, but responsive enough that it doesn't feel like it's going to explode my phone. The web apps, on the other hand, are a scatter-shot. Snort works about as well as the Bluesky web app, but it glitches out, it resets your avatar to some AI garbage, and then refreshes back to what you actually have ... the feed goes blank, and there are, of course, errors.

This was the *better* experience.

In the few other apps I tried, there was little to no functionality, or there was total functionality, with no features whatsoever.

Do Nostr developers want me to be on my phone 24/7?

And, how can we talk about how it feels to use Nostr, or Damus, or any of the web apps, without talking about the userbase.

Here's a drive-by scroll via Damus for you:

Maybe I'm viewing the wrong feeds, or I've messed something up, but most of what I see on Nostr are people who seem to worship BTC as if it was their personal god. Like, a space where the only thing anyone's interested in is cryptocurrency, and sometimes right-wing politics.

I don't know, that's not really the kind of thing I tend to interact with, so it's a bit alienating. Where are the people talking about gaming, or technology, or Linux, or even just anime or something?

"Bro, I LOVE bitcoin, my ENTIRE LIFE is centered around it! What? No, I definitely have other interests. Have you heard of Ethereum? You can verify smart contracts with it."

This is kind of the same problem Mastodon had in 2016. Very tech-worker centered, not a lot of room for normal people, with normal interests, except in this case it's people with a crypto gambling addiction. I expressed before how much I *loathed* this when I was still actively participating in the NFT space.

If your community looks as though I'm being inducted into a cult centered around crypto upon entering, I'm not sure I, or anyone else, is going to feel inclined to stick around and chill. You know what I mean? Maybe the people behind Nostr can take this as some constructive criticism, or, ignore me completely.

Anyway, let's sum up what we've learned from this treck into the BTC social network space ...

There are far too many ways to access Nostr, and usually that wouldn't be a problem, but most of those access points are broken, or extremely lacking. Some apps attempt to nudge you into paying them for an address (or, better known as, blue check verification), and it's entirely unclear if this is required if you intend to stick around, AND, you might end up paying people who use theft algorithms. You *can* get paid for posting, if you actively know how to use a Bitcoin wallet, and if you actually feel like interacting with people who talk about *nothing but bitcoin*. And, some way, somehow, you're able to get Nostr to federate to the fediverse, and Mastodon, but the method of how this is accomplished is beyond me. But ... at that point, maybe you should just use Mastodon?

My overall impression of Nostr, the network Jack Dorsey ran to after being evicted from Twitter, and chased off of Bluesky, is that it needs ... uh, work.
