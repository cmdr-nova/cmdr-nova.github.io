Update: I've been made aware that Mozilla's AUP has been the same *for decades*, and this is only coming to light, because the egregious changes they've made more recently have brought *more* strange things to the surface.

I wasn't going to write about all of this, at first, because it's just one thing in a years-long trend of Mozilla betraying everything they're supposed to stand for in order to ride the generative theft and destruction train. But! I've seen maybe ... *one* person talk about their new acceptable use policy, and for all intents and purposes, they *absolutely* now prohibit the use of their services to display pornographic material.

You might be thinking, "Who cares? Is porn that important?"

Most people are online to look at porn, or, *at least*, they *do* at some point. It's human nature.

Via their own new <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/acceptable-use/" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a>

<blockquote>
You may not use any of Mozilla’s services to:<br /><br />

Upload, download, transmit, display, or grant access to content that includes graphic depictions of sexuality...
</blockquote>

Because, you *definitely* need a tech company to decide for you what you can view using a web browser, or technology connected to it.

Now, this doesn't *explicitly* state that viewing porn *with* Firefox is a breach of their AUP. It's more to do with their cloud and/or other services, like syncing, tab sharing between devices, and so on. But! If you're a *regular* Firefox user, you probably do *at least* one of these things, and you've probably *already* violated their updated Acceptable Use Policy.

This news came alongside other changes they made, such as casually talking about how they're <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/technical-and-interaction-data" target="_blank">collecting your browser interaction data</a>.

So ... actually, maybe it *would* be a violation of their AUP to even so much as search for something like "boobies."

You be the judge!

I'll be on <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>. Not because porn is a central reason for my using the internet (I switched to Vivaldi months and months ago after Mozilla introduced AI "features" into their browser), but because Mozilla wants *everything you do* to be a record that they can collect, and use for their own gain, *including* training AI, among a million other things they shouldn't be doing. And I just don't have any time, or energy for all of that. Everything is *already* exhausting and annoying, *enough*.

With the rise of generative theft continuing, and the general masses growing closer and closer to excusing it, or turning a blind eye to it: You certainly don't have to be among them. And you shouldn't be okay with your personal data being used to train the fascist destruction of the arts.
