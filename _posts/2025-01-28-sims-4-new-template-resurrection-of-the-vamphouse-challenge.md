So, I was thinking today, "Hey, my old website used to have a section dedicated to The Sims 4 where I hosted a downloadable version of my game template." And, after some consideration, I decided to put it back! Although, as of posting this, EA released an update to Sims 4 that *somehow* completely broke their servers, and now you can't launch the game ... at all. Which means, I can't finish editing my new 2025 Sims 4 world template. Thanks EA! But, that's not the only thing I've added to the site.

The template <a href="/pages/thesims/">will be here</a>, once they fix what they broke.

But, back in 2019, I was *really* into doing Sims 4 challenges. I was still out-of-work, so I spent most of the time that I wasn't working on personal projects, playing The Sims 4.

I enjoyed the Legacy Challenge the most, because it involved starting with *nothing*, and then building up a massive family legacy over numerous generations of sims. I could never really make it past the first generation, though, because, like in all of my save files, I find it hard to let go of the originals. Never-the-less, I thought it would be cool to make *my own* version of the Legacy Challenge.

So, I wrote something, and hosted it on Google Sheets, so that people could connect to and read it. And then some years passed, and it vanished, along with the website where I originally posted it. And, for the longest time, I thought it was just gone, completely.

But, much like my Second Life guide, *nothing is ever gone, forever*.

Now, if you navigate to the right (or from the pop-out menu at the top, if you're on mobile), you'll find my original VampHouse Challenge recovered and preserved on its own page, <a href="/sims4/vamphouse">right here</a> on my website!

My head hurts a little bit right now, so I haven't jumped into re-reading the whole thing, but, basically, it's a challenge that revolves around the idea of the original save file I had way, *way* back, when I first started playing The Sims 4. I had my own sim, and I moved her into a house. Eventually, she got married and had a child to another sim. Then, someone who will not be named (cause she's a jerk), from Mastodon, bought me the Vampire pack, and, well, I *had* to play with it, right?

So I made a new sim, a vampire, and I moved her in down the street from the family I started.

I became *so engrossed* with this sim, that I ended up moving her into my main house.

And then, one thing led to another, and the vampire, and my original main sim, became romantically involved, and then had a huge family of children. This grew into a massive household, and sims that branched out across the 4 different worlds that there were in the game, at the time. Which, after digging up the save file, and incorporating aspects of it into a world template, I thought, "This should be a challenge people can do themselves."

So now it is.

If you feel up to it, and partake in this years-old challenge, upload the family you create to the Sims 4 gallery, and use the hashtag #vamphousechallenge. Maybe I'll check them out, and maybe I'll use them in my own world!
