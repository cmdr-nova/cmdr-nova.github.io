<p>On most mornings I find myself literally crawling out of bed. See, I sleep on top of a mattress that’s topped with memory foam, that’s also topped with more memory foam. I basically sleep in one gushy square of foam, so getting up out of it is kind of a chore sometimes. To add to that, I also have a 15 pound weighted blanket on top of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You would think, having a job, I wouldn’t make it so hard on myself getting out of bed. But it’s never been a problem … yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I’m out of bed, I stumble over to my couch and pass out for another five to ten minutes, just for good measure. My cat paces back and forth waiting for me to grab his can of pate so that he can have his breakfast. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After my second jolt of sleep, I grab my work clothes and jump into the shower. I bathe with a bar of soap that smells like bourbon, and despite professional advice, I shampoo my hair every single time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afterward, I jump out, slap on most of my work attire, and then I make myself a quick breakfast. It’s around this time I usually give my cat his breakfast as well. A breakfast he never usually finishes, but begs me for, anyway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I’ve had breakfast, the rest of my morning is brushing my teeth, putting on the rest of my clothes, and sitting on my couch in anticipation of having to leave for work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s my morning work routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The day off, not doing a damn thing routine, is more … sleep until I can’t anymore, and then watch YouTube until I’m starving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks for joining me in this look at my morning-life.</p>

<p>I’m more of a night person.</p>
