I know, I know. It's been a little bit of a long time coming, but I have an explanation. There are explanations for everything. While I was in the middle of writing chapter four, Fallout 4 released! This was pretty awesome, because the game is amazing. But I won't go into detail about that because it isn't entirely important to this update, nor is the fact that I also went through most of the main campaign in New Vegas, started playing Elder Scrolls Online (Add&nbsp;@paxcorpus if you like) again and am slowly working my way through Alien: Isolation (An amazing entry into the franchise).<br />
<br />
Having burned myself out from 3D modeling, I decided to take a little break, and now that my head is sort of in the right place, I've finished chapter four of NETHERBOUND and am preparing to head into chapter five, rightly titled <i>Jack of Spades</i>.<br />
<br />
Chapter four details a death-defying space walk within the already mentioned black hole where our ship, the Tredecim is hanging, suspended in hyperspace. You can read the whole chapter, and the rest of the rough draft chapters here, through <a href="http://nbserial.tumblr.com/post/132651011541/netherbound-index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the index page</a>.<br />
<br />
Chapter five, though, is going to be a bit different than anything I've done in my previous books. Instead of having the ship's artificial intelligence spend an entire chapter simply talking to the reader, we're going to literally jump into the mind of Jack Marcellus, which will detail certain unrevealed things and lead up to the beginning of NETHERBOUND, at which point the story will continue, mostly uninterrupted from any further gazing into the past.<br />
<br />
Way back when I originally started writing this book, the beginning was very, very different. With those ideas from the first incarnation in mind, I'll be using them to detail in a much shorter fashion the how and why. For months I struggled with wanting to write that particular story, but also wanting to move forward to what I had planned <i>next</i>. Although I have explained my reasons for doing all that I've done, this is another reason I decided to <i>start</i> with what I wanted to do next, and gently inject the original story into this new form the story has taken.<br />
<br />
But hey, that's all for now. I hope you enjoy reading what I've got so far for the rough draft, and look forward to what's to come. The pacing may be a bit slower, but that's how rollercoasters work, right?
