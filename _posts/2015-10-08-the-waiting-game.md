So today I'm not really doing any work, you know, aside from the "Miami beach" themed photoshoot I did for a little promotion on Flickr (view that album here: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/revosa/albums/72157659589788652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami</a>). Why, though, am I not working? For one, I sent in a process credit on my Second Life account on Saturday and it's being stalled four days later for unscheduled maintenance on the entire billing system, which also means any sales I could be making are currently not happening.<br />
<br />
I also applied for the TMP dev kit earlier last week and am currently waiting to receive the email and the kit so that I can get to work on lipstick, eyeshadow, liner and more. But, as it always goes, this is a waiting game, and since I've signed up with them for exclusive makeup, I can't exactly go and make a bunch of system layer makeup (which I'd have to convert later anyway).<br />
<br />
And <i>then</i> I'm also waiting on the Maitreya dev kit so that I can perfect system layer clothing, and <i>maybe</i> create specialized versions of all my mesh clothing specifically for Maitreya.<br />
<br />

What this means is, basically, my production is halted while I simply wait. On everything. But maybe it's best I take a day and focus on some other things.<br />
<br />
One good thing has come of all of this though! Just a few hours ago I decided to sponsor Making Strides Against Breast Cancer at my inworld store with a donation kiosk, a promise desk, and a cheap little hunt item that, for twenty linden, will give you my newest "Pink Explosion" nails (for Maitreya)! Proceeds, of course, go directly toward the fundraiser. Stop by my store <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Pisces/178/239/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and check it out!<br />
<br />
With all of that aside, I really have no idea what I'd like to work on today besides maybe relaxing a little bit... or maybe the cybernetic arms I plan to release for the holiday season? We'll see!
