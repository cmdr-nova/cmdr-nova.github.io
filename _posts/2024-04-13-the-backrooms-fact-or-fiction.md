<p>We've all been there. The gas station on the side of the road in the middle of the night, the mall near closing time, your own living space at three in the morning. Liminal spaces. A concept that was a sensation on Tumblr years, and years ago. And then it became something bigger, burst straight from the chest of 4chan.</p>

<p>The Backrooms.</p>

<p>Obviously, the phrase "noclip" is kind of juvenile in the way it explains things. Like a videogame, because we definitely can't differentiate reality from a game world. Phasing in and out of reality, that sounds more like a believable piece of science, even if fiction.</p>

<p>But I think it goes deeper than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Backrooms, The Complex, whatever you call it, it's all based on this idea, and this feeling of liminality. Is it a human feeling? Is it something that exists on a higher dimension that we're unable to decipher with the senses we're given?</p>

<p>I remember waking up from a nap one day, maybe six years ago at this point, after having dreamt of a person consoling me, for reasons unknown. And when I opened my eyes that same person was standing over me, except darker, shrouded in some kind of malice I couldn't really grasp at the time. Staring down at me. She wasn't any person who existed on this plane, and she vanished seconds after I flipped on the light. And it makes me think, was I there, was I temporarily trapped in some other universe, phasing in and out of what we know to be real?</p>

<p>Or, was I just exhausted and seeing weird things as a result of sleep deprivation and stress?</p>

<p>A lot of people look at you like you're off the deep-end if you start talking about ghosts, or other realities, or universes. Some of these things are backed by theoretical science. That a universe, or another reality, <em>could</em> exist on the edges of the dimensions that we can perceive as human beings. But, to the average person, I'm sure that <em>also</em> sounds completely ridiculous.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to this creepypasta, Backrooms fiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What if you really <em>could</em> slip into some other dimension? What if you couldn't come back? What if every single experience that people around the world describe as ghosts, or supernatural, is just ... some version of another reality, phasing into our own?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What if there are ... other "rooms" we can't see? What if your totally regular, meandering life, could suddenly be uprooted and interrupted at the flick of a switch? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What if that's already happened to <em>millions</em> of missing people?</p>
