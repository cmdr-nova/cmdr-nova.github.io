Hello everybody! It's Meryl S. Kavanagh, author of <b><i>PaxCorpus</i></b> and <i><b>Escape Velocity</b></i>! I have returned from the darkness to bring to you the most concrete evidence that I am still alive! I know some of you may have read Escape Velocity and are probably going nuts wondering what in the hell happens next, right? So instead of making people wait even longer (since I've had so many hiccups and issues over 2015) I'm writing the sequel to Escape Velocity live on Tumblr.<br />
<br />
I'm callling it a live serial drafting, so basically you can read the rough draft as I write it, in small "bite" sized pieces that are easier to digest than having a full novel chapter shoved at you.<br />
<br />
You can find the <i><b>NETHERBOUND serial project</b></i> <a href="http://nbserial.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on its Tumblr blog (if you're uncertain how to find the installments, click the NB Serial link at the top of the page), where you can read character profiles, look over my previous books and read each chapter as they're written! Currently there is a <a href="http://nbserial.tumblr.com/post/132420877801/netherbound-chapter-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small piece of the first chapter</a> on display and ready to read. "The End of Everything" chapter 1.2 is coming soon as a continuation to the beginning of the novel that will redefine #thepaxseries in every possible way.<br />
