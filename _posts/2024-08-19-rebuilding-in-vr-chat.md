It's been days since I took my Second Life store, essentially, *down*. Sure, it still technically exists on the Second Life marketplace site, and sales *do* come in through that platform, it's just not the same as actually having a presence *in* Second Life. And, I really do think that, after all these years, maybe it really *is* time to move on to bigger things. Things that don't cost you money for *every little thing you do*. Obviously, I'm referencing Linden Labs (of Second Life) charging for uploads, charging for land, charging for "premium" features (that are basically essential if you're running a store), and so on and so forth.

I wanna buy a house, someday, you know? I don't even wanna know how much of my money has escaped into Second Life, just *maintaining* this store.

So, now we look at VR Chat. A place that is, admittedly, *littered* with children ... if you *only* visit the VR worlds. I mentioned [in another post](/gaming/2024/08/15/vr-chat-second-life-for-people-who-have-a-meta-quest) my slight disdain for parents who basically "drop their kids off" into a Meta Quest so that strangers can babysit them.

Thankfully, the VRC furry community is a place of all walks of life. Albeit, in a *mostly* voice-only client, you *do* run into, or find toxic people a bit easier, but I just mute them.

I bring up the idea of "rebuilding" in VR Chat, though, because, as far as I can tell, it *doesn't cost you anything* to upload content into the client itself. It's just ... a bit more fiddly, and I'm *still* trying to figure out how to do it, or get it working while running Linux (I will not install Windows!). But, essentially, I don't even think I *have* to? It seems I can just erect a [Gumroad page](https://novacmdr.gumroad.com/){:target="_blank"}, and start reworking my Second Life creations for VR Chat. Seems pretty legit.

I definitely want to give this all more of a look, and dive into ... maybe bringing some of my SL stuff into VRC, or at least, Gumroad.

What I want to know: Are there any established creators in VRC who have some tips? 

Or, better yet, do you wanna share with me some worlds that you think are essential to visit? (I've seen plenty of PC/VR mixed worlds, but I'm looking for the *good* stuff)

Either way, thanks for stopping by!
