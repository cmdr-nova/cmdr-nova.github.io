It's a tale as old as time. You buy 400 games on Steam, but ultimately you end up back in a Blizzard game. Or, ... in this day and age, an ActiBlizzard game. Or, in this specific day and age, *Diablo 4*, so that you can prove you're better than Elon Musk.

No, I won't elaborate on that.

But I've been playing a lot of Diablo 4. I'm beyond level 50 now! Which is more than I can say for myself when the game *actually released*.

Playing *this game*, though, kind of makes Diablo 3 look like something I'm unsure how I ever enjoyed. I did, of course, but 4 is so much prettier, and *darker*, and also I'm a Necromancer and everything I touch dies in milliseconds.

Yes, bosses, too.

Diablo is something that goes back. Way back. It was one of the games I started playing after Doom and Quake finally started to get kinda *old* feeling, to me. You know, back in like 1997. You see, my uncle and cousin used to play Diablo 1, and eventually, Diablo 2 together all the time. And I wanted to join them.

*I just wasn't all that good at it*, and I didn't have any money to buy these games.

I did, however, get hold of Diablo 1. And I think back to one of my first, and last experiences with the game. A player, lending me his sword. It was powerful. I had *nothing*. I was just ... a noob. I don't even think I was halfway to whatever max level was back then.

I certainly wasn't anywhere *near* hell.

But I needed a weapon. One that was good. And this guy was willing to lend me his sword until I found something better.

"Here, you can use my sword for a while." I paraphrased. "I'll be on tomorrow!"

And then I logged off.

And then I never logged on again, *ever* (if you're out there, I'll give you a new sword in Diablo 4).

I got more serious when it came to Diablo 2, but I was still largely, *no good, and also crap*.

And then flash forward to Diablo 4, I'm alright, I guess.

Through D3 and D4, though, I *do* find it continually strange, as my Necromancer draws no fear from other people, and in Diablo 4, my Necro speaks about the "light," and heaven.

Meanwhile I'm here like, ... wouldn't the Necromancer be on Lillith's side?

Then again, I haven't even finished act 1 (I spend a lot of time wandering and doing mostly nothing but side quests and killing bosses).

I think if Blizzard ever made a new MMO, they should just do it with this. I mean, that's basically what it is at this point.

Anyway, that's the post. I just wanted to say, "Hey, Diablo 4 is pretty cool."
