<p>On May 24th, 2019, I published a short story named Throne of the Forsaken: The Shattering (available <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/940801" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SBRZ7V7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a>), which detailed a fictional world where the Earth has been heavily impacted by cataclysmic climate change. The situation is so dire that the planet has transformed into what Venus might have been before it was completely uninhabitable. And through the miracle of human engineering, the entire population of Earth seeks to salvage their survival.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was and is meant to set the stage for a larger story and an entire new universe that takes place 20,000 years later on a transformed and healed planet, now called Ellenara.</p>

<p>The idea is that I want to craft my own fantasy type world, except instead of being in a place of an imagined past, it is the future. But, I won't be continuing this world with an immediate 100,000+ word follow-up, and here's why.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now we live in a world where many things demand our attention, and everything is very fast-paced. We all ingest more information than the average person did 60 years ago (just 60 years!) in their entire lifetimes, now, in a single day. Because of this, it seems to me that, as a still somewhat unknown author, a full-blown months, to year long novel project could be a risk, <em>a very large risk</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to negate such a risk, though, I will instead, first and foremost, be writing at least five more short stories that take place in this new future, within the world of the reshaped Earth. This will involve multiple characters of different races, such as Marked Elves, Smog Knolls, Tempest Halflings, Torn Dwarves and more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I will also be writing other short stories that take place in entirely different universes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This multiverse I've got setup is loosely based on another type of shattering that happened at the end of the third book I published (NetherBound), and how a time paradox forever changed the multiverse as we knew it (or didn't know it).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More of that may or may not be detailed, but what's coming next from me, at least in the world of fiction will be: 'Throne of the Forsaken: The Witch of the East', and a short story in a completely different universe called, 'Standby, Reallocating' (I'm keeping this one almost entirely a secret).</p>
