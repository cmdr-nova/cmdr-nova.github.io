<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What fears have you overcome and how?</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few years ago I submitted a real story to one of those true crime/horror podcasts. To this date, I still don't know if it ended up being used (because there are so many submissions), but I figured this could be a good time to write it down, again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today's writing prompt is about overcoming fears, and how you've done it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wouldn't really say I've overcome this fear. I'd say I mostly just push it to the back of my mind as much as possible, and that's <em>just</em> enough to allow me to sleep soundly at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I'm getting too far ahead of myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in around 2016, or 2017, it was so long ago now I don't clearly remember which year it happened, but I know it was <em>one</em> of those years--It was the afternoon, I believe, sometime during the end of Summer, or Spring. For whatever reason, I was a little bit tired, and I had the idea in my head at the time to give astral projection a shot. What better time to do that when you feel like you could use a nap?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Made sense to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It started when I laid down in my bed. The instructions online said to look onward, and focus on one thing, and then allow yourself to close your eyes and drift off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't think what happened was astral projection, but it was something that crossed over from whatever state I was in, and into the actual, living, breathing world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is going to sound impossible, improbable, but with every bit of seriousness I can muster for you through text: This <em>happened</em>, and I can still see her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember bits of the dream. I was lying in my bed, covers up to my neck, and I was in a bad state of mind. Something was <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a woman in my bedroom with me, and she had long dark-ish hair, a sweater, or long-sleeved shirt of some kind, with jeans, and for unknown reasons, she was attempting to comfort me. Comforting me over ... things I still am unsure about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She climbed up onto my chest, and she placed her hands on me. This wasn't anything sexual in any sense of the word. This unknown woman sat on my chest as if trying to reach into me. And she told me it was okay, it was all over, and that "they" were <em>all</em> gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my dream, I began to cry. Whatever she was talking about didn't seem to sit well with me, it was ... considerably upsetting. That particular sentence, "They're all gone." That's what shot me out of my sleeping state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I opened my eyes, my room was now much darker, with only the illumination of my computer monitor lighting up the surroundings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there she was, standing right next to my bed, staring down at me. She looked the same, but somehow darker, <em>different</em> ... <em>wrong.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that moment, I wasn't terrified. I wasn't scared. I was ... bewildered. Confused. Not exactly how one should react if suddenly you're thinking or <em>seeing</em> that there's an intruder in your home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I pulled off my covers and sat upright in my bed on my knees, and I flicked on the overhead lights. She was <em>still</em> there. I leaned in and attempted to wrap my arms around her, in some kind of effort to apprehend this stranger who was not only standing in my room, but watching me sleep. As if it was interesting, or as if she'd been projecting herself <em>into my mind</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was then that she turned from me, and while looking back as if I <em>had scared her</em>, she vanished through the closed bedroom door. Like some clich√© version of a ghost in cinema who can pass through walls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think I sat for a while after all was said and done at my computer, and I let it really sink in as to <em>what</em> happened. <em>That's when I finally got scared</em>. That was when the terror of the situation <em>actually</em> hit me. A severely delayed reaction for something so utterly strange, and supernatural, that it <em>shouldn't</em> have happened at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spent about a week restless, unable to sleep properly at night. I started staying up until dawn, and then, and only then, would I crawl into bed and drift into sleep. I was already a bit of a night owl, so this worked out for me. But this event has never left me. Much like the hauntings of the past that I experienced many, <em>many </em>years ago, it just ... became a part of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the ghosts who toyed with me when I was sixteen years old living in a very old house. The child singing lullabies to himself in my closet. The faces in the window to the doorway when we'd leave. The objects moving across the floor in broad daylight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all attached itself to my psyche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I sleep now, I sleep with my bed against the wall. I keep a cover over myself right up to my head, and I don't tend to concentrate too hard on what's going on when I'm trying to get what I need, so that I can go to work the next day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I still think about it. I still see her there at the side of my bed, looking down at me, as if it never ended. As if it's still happening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I don't know why it <em>happened</em>, or who she even was. I don't know if I <em>want</em> to know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If, after reading this, you're thinking I've written you some kind of little piece of flash fiction--I haven't. This is something that happened to me in the real world, as we live and breathe. And I have no explanation for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you've ever listening to my music, this one event is what fueled me when I put this song together.</p>
