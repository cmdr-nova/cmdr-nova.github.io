Just recently, I wrote about Mozilla proposing their new "AI" features in their nightly builds, and was sharing around the post they made, via another user on the fediverse, calling for all Firefox-enjoyers to run on over and tell them to stop. And thousands upon *thousands* of people *did*. It's one of the largest gatherings of anti-AI force I've seen *so far*, and it was glorious.

Contrary to all of that, Mozilla is pulling the new and quite popular corporate response to backlash, and *completely ignoring everything.* Which brings us to today's post on Mozilla making the move to shut down their Mastodon instance, *completely*.

I screenshotted this so that it can't be erased by Mozilla themselves, but do you see that? Do you see the *entire lack* of a verifiable reason as to why they've made this decision? Just a "Welp, goodbye. Everyone pack your bags and get out of here."

Interesting.

Gee, I wonder if it's because ... logging on to see thousands of people telling you that your company is making the wrong move, making *bad* decisions, and tossing user data and privacy concerns out the window, is just too much to handle? I don't know. Maybe paying for AI data farms that slowly melt away the ice caps is more important to you than the 40 bucks it costs to pay a managed host to keep your instance online.

That couldn't possibly be it, could it, Mozilla?

But, here's the thing: If you, as a company, have made a decision, and you can't even back up that decision in the face of people who might not like it, and said company opts to *cut off discourse completely*, instead, that says just one thing: Mozilla is ashamed of what they've done, and are doing, and *they know* it is indefensible.
