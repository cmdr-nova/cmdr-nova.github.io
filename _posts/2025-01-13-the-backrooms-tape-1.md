So, there's been a bit of a Kane Pixels drought, ever since <a href="https://youtu.be/acdYs9tPLko?si=lKMN9wQ8WRGbjgWn" target="_blank">Found Footage 3</a> was released, and if you haven't watched that yet, *you need to*. I'm assuming the release of these shorts has been slower, due to the production of the full length feature film that was announced ... quite some time ago, at this point. In conjunction with A24, Backrooms, or The Complex, the MOVIE, is set to release ... uh, sometime before I die of old age, hopefully! But, until then, we have content to watch from other, smaller-time creators.

I'm *very* selective with the Backrooms content I'll watch. The silly, slides-and-coconut-milk (or whatever it is?) backrooms-wiki creations are ... we'll just say, mostly *bad*. Turning Backrooms into a huge thing that tons of people are adding to without any consideration for *what's* being added, really takes the actual fear and immersion completely away from the concept. Which is why I don't consume that content.

I pretty much *only* watch Backrooms content that is either Kane Pixels, or works inspired by it.

And, even then, sometimes those videos are a little iffy. Sometimes the pacing of the camera-holder versus their footstep movement doesn't match up well, at all. Sometimes the textures have bad lighting and it's extremely obvious that they're just recording in Blender, hence, breaking immersion. Other times, they'll try to incorporate scenes with actual people in them, or the person who's lost, themselves, and they're *really* not great looking 3D models.

Kane is the masterclass, and there are some who follow the formula well.

Today, I discovered TheMrLeoniasty on Youtube, through his Tape 1 video, and it's really something else. It's not 100% perfect, some of the pacing is a little off, but it doesn't try and take the usual formula that most everyone else does (think: howler / bacteria chase scenes that happen in every single video). It, instead, does something *entirely* different (although, I'm not sure yet how I feel about the PS2 boot screen).

It's very slow paced, until the end. The end is absolutely something to behold, as a Backrooms enjoyer.

Watch.
