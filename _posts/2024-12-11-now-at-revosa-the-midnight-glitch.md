Today I woke up and felt like it was time to actually put something up in my Second Life store ... again! The last two times I released something, I told myself I was going to be more consistent, and then I got distracted by the forty other things I do. Maybe this time will be different? Anyway, it's a skirt. I'm putting a new line of clothing in my store, for a very tiny skirt that you can try right at my store, now.

You can see them on the marketplace webpage outside of Second life, <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Midnight-Glitch/26680068" target="_blank">here</a>. Or, you can drop by and see them right in front of your own face, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/26/2003" target="_blank">here</a>!
