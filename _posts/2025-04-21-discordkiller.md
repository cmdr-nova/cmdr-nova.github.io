It's been a little while since I've written on an actual topic. A lot of that has to do with me filling my free time with building a ridiculous world around my base in Minecraft Java (heavily modded), and jumping back into World of Warcraft on my original DeathKnight from ... uh, whatever year Wrath of the Lich King released. And that kind of has to do with why I want to write this today. Why I want to write about how Discord, the community chat app, has, and *is*, killing communities not only around the web, but also within games.

I think I've written before about how Discord has almost completely killed usage of internet forums (which is partially why I decided to host my own forum, even if nobody feels like joining it)
