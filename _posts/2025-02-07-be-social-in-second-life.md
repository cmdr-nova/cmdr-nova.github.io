I was writing a post this morning about mobile games and whether or not they've reach the glass ceiling of actually being worthy of the title "game," but then I went to work, and twelve hours later ... I don't really feel like writing about that! I mean, it's in the drafts, so maybe I'll continue it. But, I actually kind of want to write about Second Life. As in, I don't really know if it's really my thing anymore?

I mean, I still run a store, and I think it'll be there regardless, until the servers shut down. But, way back in the day, like 2016 or so, I had little virtual-world-friend-groups, and I always had people to talk to. It was *easy* to meet and make friends. Nowadays? I dunno. I meet someone through Thundr (the Second Life dating/friend app), we talk for about a minute, maybe meet up outside of the app ...

And then that's it. You never hear from them again.

I don't know if it's just me being older, and less tolerant of going through the process of meeting someone, doing smalltalk, getting to know them, and then finding out they suck, or they wanted something out of me that I can't give, or so on and so forth.

But even just with *friends*. I have a long list of people on my Second Life friend list, and *none of them have messaged me in well over a year*. Some of them, for *years*.

There's this strange phenomenon in SL, where people kind of treat time differently? Like, you've got a friend and you speak everyday, but then suddenly you have a bad week, or a busy couple of days, and you just *don't talk."

And then they're gone.

As if you were missing for years, and they forgot about you.

It's **weird**. 

I dunno, I just had to rant a little bit about that. Because when I'm logged into Second Life I spend most of my time just hanging out in my house on the hill, and then logging off. Maybe it **is** a "me" problem.
