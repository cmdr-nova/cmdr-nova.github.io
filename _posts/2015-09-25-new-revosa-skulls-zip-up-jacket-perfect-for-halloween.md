Just in time for Halloween (only a little over a month away, I know!) is the REVOSA Skulls Zip-up Jacket.<br />
<br />
This comes in five classic sizes with an included alpha and has been tested on a wide variety of classic sizes and an average sized Maitreya mesh body.<br />
<br />
I strayed away from doing fitted mesh for this one because of numerous issues it was producing, although I'm sure there's at least one size in here that will fit you. If not, give me an IM and I will personally fit a jacket to your body.<br />
