It's been a hell of a week. Work has been busy. I've been tentatively trying to get back to finding new work as a web developer, because that's the career I should've been in twenty some odd years ago, and by golly gee whiz, I'm going to get it. But that's not why I'm writing you today, Mr. Internet. I'm writing, because the AI bubble is having a giant shit, and it's popping, and Nvidia is tanking. Thank the all mighty Flying Spaghetti Monster, and Venus' molten atmosphere: AI might be finished, or, at least, seriously diminished to the point that it's no longer a fad that annoying bastards on public social media timelines spam you about all day.

Drink it in. Greedy, unoriginal, plagiarism loving fucks, are having themselves a cry. And the juice couldn't be more delicious.

Why's this happening, though?

China, somehow, someway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-deepseek-ai-china-stock-nvidia-nvda-asml/" target="_blank">figured out how to do AI for pocket change</a>, compared to what American billionaires are spending, and that's *hilarious*. And I can only hope this takes a chunk out of Meta, out of Twitter, and most importantly, out of Sam Altman's mega-grift of stealing the entire internet to power his wrong-answer machine.

Albeit, AI should go away, *completely*. But if I have to settle for China doing it slightly better, and crashing the entire stock market. Well. I'll take it.

Thanks, China.

As I dump year old malt liquor into my Dr. Pepper, I sit and reflect on two years of bullshit. Dudes with no imagination telling you, "This is inevitable." And corporations ignoring your consent in order to use everything you've ever typed, online, to fuel these things: Potentially becoming worthless e-waste.

Man, that's the JUICE.

Anyway, I'm gonna go run around in Pandora for 14 hours while I have time to myself.
