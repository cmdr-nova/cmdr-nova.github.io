So, I was tagged by <a href="https://malici.ous.computer/@shellsharks" target="_blank">@shellsharks@malici.ous.computer</a> (you can visit the post on his own site that he references, <a href="https://shellsharks.com/music-questions-challenge" target="_blank">here</a>) on the Fedi to answer some questions about music! This is new to me, because, I was *mostly* unaware that there's some kind of blog challenge thing that goes around every once in a while. But, that's great! It gives me something to write about on days where I have no brain-space for things to write about.

The questions are as follows:

```
1. What are five of your favorite ablums?
2. What are five of your favorite songs?
3. Favorite instrument(s)?
4. What song or album are you currently listening to?
5. Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?
6. How often do you listen to music?
7. How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?
8. What’s a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?
9. What’s your favourite song of all time?
10. Has your taste in music evolved over the years?
```

Jumping right into the first question, **"What are five of your favorite albums?"**

I think I'd have to think back through all of my years being alive, because I've become a creature of repetition in the recent past. But, here's the list.

1: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/311283715" target="_blank">Sevendust - Home</a>

This is the *very first album* I ever bought as a teenager, and will remain one of my favorites.

2: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/302196508" target="_blank">Orgy - Candyass</a>

From the years before I fell heavily into KoRn, this album was gifted to me at the age of 16 when I began living in what I still believe to be the most haunted house I've ever inhabited. My first dive into industrial numetal.

3: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/967389561" target="_blank">KoRn - Life is Peachy</a>

*I. Don't. Know. Your. Fuckin'. Name. So. What. Let's.*

*Fuck.*

I loved this album so much that I learned how to do the scatman bullshit Jonathan Davis does at the beginning of this album.

4: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/1443851273" target="_blank">Deadsy - Commencement</a>

Following in the foot-steps of my beginning years of a numetal obsession, comes Deadsy, with another album that I liked quite a lot.

5: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/1532029367" target="_blank">Rammstein - Herzeleid</a>

Rammstein is special to me, because I had no idea they existed until German class in the sixth grade, when the fifty-some-odd year old teacher rolled a TV into the classroom and put on Du Hast. Never-the-less, I fell in love with Herzeleid.

6: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/927731469" target="_blank">Slipknot - Slipknot</a>

In the eleventh grade I turned into a very mad teenager, which followed Slipknot's self-titled album that was purchased for me after I begged about three times.

7: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/1440837096" target="_blank">Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral</a>

This is actually the second album I ever owned, which accompanied my more angsty, depressed teenage self. I became obsessed with Nine Inch Nails around the same time Quake 3 was one of the biggest games on PC.

8: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/302301243" target="_blank">Static-X - Wisconsin Death Trip</a>

An album for back when I was like 17 and had so much more energy than I do now. I saw Wayne Static up close and personal at Crocodile Rock out here in Pennsylvania, years before he passed away. I have one of his guitar picks.

9: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/1474185287" target="_blank">TOOL - Undertow</a>

Probably one of the best albums ever made, and one of my favorite progressive rock albums ever. The ending is especially chilling, and I love it. I used to listen to this album a lot while I was playing Tomb Raider in the nineties.

10: <a href="https://album.link/us/i/1440738173" target="_blank">Marilyn Manson - Mechanical Animals</a>

Back before it was revealed that Manson was kind of a giant asshole with all kinds of things wrong with him, this was on repeat pretty much all of the time, when I wasn't listening to KoRn and Nine Inch Nails. It brings back all the memories of sitting in front of Aol Instant Messenger talking to my three internet girlfriends and posting incessantly on animeboards.com.

"But Nova, the question said **FIVE** favorite albums." 

Oh yeah? Who said I follow rules?

Next question: **What are five of your favorite songs?**

1: <a href="https://song.link/us/i/1572930403" target="_blank">Power Glove - Brain Jack</a>

Jumping directly into my more recent listening habits, and retro-synth obsession, Brain Jack is like an anthem to a cybernetic lifestyle I wish I was living.

2: <a href="https://song.link/us/i/926187670" target="_blank">Slipknot - Psychosocial</a>

No, I didn't stop listening to Slipknot after their self-titled album. I actually never stopped.

3: <a href="https://song.link/us/i/1434900919" target="_blank">Nine Inch Nails - The Perfect Drug</a>

Yes, one of my favorite NIN songs isn't even on an album. But I was so addicted to it in my teen years that it can't *not* be on this list.

4: <a href="https://song.link/us/i/1474185654" target="_blank">TOOL - Schism</a>

Another one of the greatest songs ever made by the best progressive rock band in the world, I've listened to this every year *since it came out*.

5: <a href="https://song.link/us/i/914145878" target="_blank">Dance with the Dead - Dressed to Kill</a>

How could I end this list without jumping back to the present. *I love this track*. I listen to it constantly, and have done so, for years.

Anyway, let's get into question number three ... **Favorite instrument(s)?**

My favorite instrument is probably really cliche, but I'm pretty fond of the guitar. I used to have one, and I used to also play it. But I lost that thing. It was a Gibson Warlock. If I still had it today, who knows, maybe I'd be in a full-fledged band???

Fourth question: **What song or album are you currently listening to?**

<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1500836562" target="_blank">A Cruel Angel's Thesis</a>

Question numero cinco: **Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?**

I *used* to listen to the radio way back, maybe fifteen some years ago. That was before I caved to streaming, and before I started buying albums on Bandcamp to put on my almost equally as old iPod. I think radio has a place in today's society, but it's so commercial I find literally almost no reason to even touch it in 2025.

Question 666: **How often do you listen to music?**

I listen to music as often as I can. If I were allowed to wear my Airpods at work, I'd probably be listening while I work. And while I listen to a lot of true crime podcasts while I drive, I still manage to make time for music in my daily life.

Number 7: **How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?**

I don't discover new music as often as I should. I have this problem where I'll like something, or an entire genre, and that's the only thing I'll listen to. *For years*. But I've gotten better about it. I *make* myself go onto Bandcamp and look through genres I like, and here and there I'll drop some money on an album, especially if I've never heard of the artist before.

The eighth question goes, **"What’s a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?"**

I think Orgy doesn't get enough recognition in industrial numetal, pretty much *at all*. They've been around since the 90s, and *they're still doing live music*, but they're nowhere near as big as KoRn or Nine Inch Nails, and that's a shame. They should have *way more albums* and should still be talked about. I don't really understand why they've been an under-the-radar band since the early 2000s.

Second to last question, **What’s your favourite song of all time?**

Oh fuck that's easy, <a href="https://song.link/us/i/201268495" target="_blank">System of a Down - B.Y.O.B.</a>

And, the final question: **Has your taste in music evolved over the years?**

I think it's mostly stayed the same, but in a lot of evolved ways. I started out with numetal, then industrial, then metal, then numetal again, then industrial metal, then electronic, then synthwave, then darksynth / industrial, and then back to numetal again. Because I miss the 90s.

Music has been pretty important to me all of my life, even as I made my own albums and darksynth weirdness in FL Studio. I have a lot of memories and feelings locked into albums and songs that I kind of refuse to listen to, even twenty years later. It's like a memory-bomb that sits in a plastic case somewhere in my room.

But, I think a life without music, is a weird life. What you doin'? Staring at a blank wall? Psh.
