Originally, this rifle was meant to be scripted for CCS, but due to the gigantic restraints that the script developers put on weapon developers, I've decided the best option would be to simply sell my weapons (this being the first of many) full perm to those who have the patience and know-how (I'm not all that great at script management anyway).<br />
