Also released today, a special kind of nail polish. Is this good for Halloween? Probably.<br />
<br />
Not so good if you're an amputee, or the mother of a serial killer!<br />
<br />
Ice Truck Killer nail polish package comes with Maitreya applier HUD, notecard and a free energy drink as always.<br />
<br />
Being a giant fan of Dexter, this was a pleasure to make, and won't be the last I do either!<br />
