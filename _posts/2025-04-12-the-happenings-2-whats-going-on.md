It's been a little bit since I've last written directly, here on the site. Most of this has to do with mental burn-out and the current political climate. The rest of it has to do with me being *absolutely* addicted to Minecraft and the little world I've built where I routinely solo-raid the Nether while continually building cobblestone fences around my house. But, I figured I'd write something here before I head off to work for the umpteenth time.

So, first things first, if you missed it, I am now a moderator over at <a href="https://labyrinth.zone">labyrinth.zone</a>, wherein I'll be working with other moderators handling reports. I threw my hat into the ring with this instance, because it is, quite frankly, one of my favorite places to post. Why not go deeper in that involvement? Hence, here we are.

In other personal updates, I've been trying to find a solution to my want for a personal Minecraft Java server, that can be public, and also have some addons, *without it costing nearly 60 dollars a month*. And it would seem that the only current solution there would potentially be for this, would be to host the server entirely myself, on my *own* system. Which, I don't think I'd like to do.

Since I currently pay Linden Labs to have my own personal homestead where I host my store, and some other little things, it wouldn't currently make sense to suddenly erect a Minecraft server that adds on to those costs.

Everything costs too much in 2025.

In relation to my music, and the ongoing album I've been working on, I haven't had much of a chance to move forward with this yet, but I think it *is* a good idea to periodically talk about how I've decided to drop the "PLEXX" project, and move everything back to <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Eyeshadow 2600 FM</a>. As long and as nonsense as the name is for this musical project, I decided that there's really no reason to abandon pieces of the past, *just* because I was weird about naming things 8 years ago.

And, as for my book, "Dissolution Protocol," I haven't really made a whole lot of progress on this. In fact, as soon as "AI" became a thing, I mostly stopped progressing in writing entirely. Unless, you know, it has to do with writing on my website.

This is still something I'm working through, trying to grasp at reasons to continue, while there are potentially hundreds of thousands of people out there drooling over the chance to rip-off anyone and everything for their own personal gain.

But, that's mostly it from me in regard to personal updates.

As another reminder, I'm running an old-school kind of bulletin board over at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster/" target="_blank">forum.mkultra.monster</a>, where you can sign up, drop a thread, start a conversation, and maybe even contribute to starting up a community! Go on, give it a shot. There's no downside to setting up an account, and hey, maybe you'll enjoy this little slice of old-net that I'm propping up for a few bucks a month on a VPS.

And, finally, if you know of a Minecraft Java server solution that doesn't cost an arm, leg, and an eyeball to put up and run for fun, let me know! My comment section should be working on here, or you can just @ me at <a href="https://labyrinth.zone/daemon_nova" target="_blank">daemon_nova@labyrinth.zone</a>.

Thanks for reading.
