It's time for the tri-monthly update on the Mastodon instance I run, [mkultra.monster](https://mkultra.monster/about){:target="_blank"} (no, it's not hosted on this website or its server, but it *is* using the same domain)! Queue me trying to figure out if it *really has been* three months since I posted anything about my instance.

In the past year, thus far, I've written an [ActivityPub guide](/pages/activitypub) on choosing instances, and software (so that people can more easily escape Twitter), and I've provided a list of instances safe for queer users, and sex workers (found at the top of my AP guide), my instance, *obviously* being one of them.

So, today, like I did a few months back, I just want to write about my instance, and other topics involving the fediverse.

Currently, I am *still* the admin, and in good news, my car repairs won't cost as much as they were originally projected to (about 300 dollars less than quoted), so any thoughts of ever having to shutdown the instance are gone.

As of posting this, the instance is mostly home to *just me*, with six other people whom have either signed up, posted for a while, and moved on, or signed up and then never posted anything. Which is fine! Some people like to have a backup at-hand, and some people like to test waters. These accounts *will remain* as long as they don't ever break any of the rules.

Speaking of rules, mkultra.monster is ***still very much staunchly anti-AI, and all use of theft-machines on the local and federated timelines are an immediate ban without question, or chances given.*** This *includes* AI-posting coming from Threads.net. I've chosen to keep Threads federating based on the assumption, or idea, that I could potentially goad people I know, or friends who are on there, into joining Mastodon ... whenever Threads decides to *finally* finish the deal and make it so people on the Threads-side can actually *see* posts from Mastodon, organically.

*Which, for all intents and purposes, could end up never happening, especially with [Project 2025 author and Heritage Foundation member, Dustin Carmack as the public policy advisor](/social%20media/2024/07/30/threads-project-2025/) for the Southern sectors at Meta.* And if that ends up being the case, I *will* eventually throw a full and hard block at Threads.

I understand this is a deal-breaker for some, but unlike a few other instances and their admins out there, I'm not always an all-or-nothing, black-and-white type of thinker, and I'll never build [a blacklist](https://fedipact.veganism.social/){:target="_blank"} that openly displays information that's been scraped from the entire fediverse, that *nobody asked permission for*. Unless we're talking about AI, or nazis (which, funnily enough, *sometimes* go hand-in-hand, which totally couldn't be correlated with the fascist mindset revolving around the destruction of the arts and their institutions).

As for the instance, if you join, I currently have no moderators working under me, it's a one-person show. In that same light, if you sign up and you see objectionable content, or things you don't like, *feel free* to report them. Sometimes I can answer immediately, sometimes I can't. But all reports *are* eventually handled, and within as little time as I can manage (while having a full-time offline job).

As stated on other pages, and in other posts, mkultra.monster is explicitly an LGBTQ+/Queer safe instance, and absolutely safe for sex workers (as long as proper content warnings are used). This *hasn't* and *will not ever* change.

Currently the user limit is 500, and that's definitely more than enough space for you, and your pals.

Or, we can just keep running this show solo. Doesn't bother me either way. I originally erected this instance based on the necessity of *wanting* to be on the fediverse, but *not wanting* to deal with overzealous, power-tripping admins who will ban someone *responding* to a troll, rather than *the troll*. But hackers.town, cybre.space, and the others I can't even remember the names of anymore, have had enough angst from me, even if one of them still harbors my account, and all the posts I made over the course of half a decade.

Anyway!

That's the beauty of the fediverse though, it's run by the people, and nobody else. It's a shame that *sometimes* that's not a good thing, but by and large, it is absolutely the best thing. The best thing, while corporate social media is overrun by engagement farmers who post like they sold their soul years ago, and pornbots run by ... well, I'm not sure anyone knows the answer to that question, but I'm sure someone will eventually figure out the location of the server-farm harboring thousands of bots who spam you on Threads with porn links.

But, until then, come on over to Mastodon, friends!
