<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If you could permanently ban a word from general usage, which one would it be? Why?</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<p>I’ve been spending parts of my day reading other people’s thoughts on this topic. A lot seem to say or have the same train of thought, “I wouldn’t ban words, I believe in freedom of speech!” And I think this is one of those instances where I would almost tend to agree, but why?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obviously, nobody wants to deal with hate. It’s the year 2024 now, and people hauling out pea-brained ideas of their fellow people intended to harm, ridicule, and marginalize is something that needed to be a thing of the past twenty years ago. Not even so much as a “can’t we all just get along” sort of deal but just kind of a line of thinking where I’m personally at, “Jesus Christ, let people exist and keep your nasty thoughts to yourself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would banning words make it easier for everyone to exist in peace? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, no it wouldn’t. If you ban the word “fart,” people are still going to squeeze out putrid gas from betwixt their butt cheeks. Just like if we ban slurs and words that are otherwise hateful, the hate-mongers around us will just find another way to be hate-mongers. If we ban the word “Nazi,” Nazis will just find something else to call themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s the thing about language, it’s endless. Some words are unpleasant, and I know this especially from experience. Such as completely at random having a dude come at me from my driver side door calling me slurs for reasons I still don’t fully understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people are bad. That’s how it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we ever arrive at a point where banning words comes up, as a society, we should first take a look at reforming and rehabilitating the people around us who live and breathe hatred. Deconstruct institutions that preach inferiority and the othering of our neighbors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do that, and banning words won’t matter.</p>
