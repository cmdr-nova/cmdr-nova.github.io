It's been a long year. Maintaining my sim in Second Life, deciding to take it down a few times when I feared I couldn't support the costs anymore, and bringing it back each time. Switching positions in my job, and then subsequently dealing with a nonstop cycle of random shifts in the mornings, middle of the day, and the evenings. And then, most recently, my car needed nearly 2000 USD worth of repairs (costs came down once the repairs were actually done, and I paid around 1400 total). It was because of this, that I had to take my sim/city down, once and for all. 100 to 130 dollars a month to maintain something like this is just *too much* when having to pay for very expensive charges in real life.

At the ass-end of this, I *did* remove my store from within Second Life completely ... for a week. Feeling heavily demoralized, I resolved to quit all of Second Life. I explored VR Chat, found a cool avatar and called it my own. But one thing really stuck out to me as an issue in VR Chat ... There are adults, sure, but there are *far too many children*. And I don't just mean, "Hey, there are kids here." I mean, there are kids, running around, screaming, shouting slurs, threatening people, or, less on the side of their own faults, being subjected to semi or *completely* not-safe-for-work content: Doing all of this, while their parents are ... nowhere to be found.

I can't stop thinking of VR Chat as a daycare center for neglected children.

And it gives me the ick. *Despite* there being a semi-prominent adult population in VRC, and having had nice interactions with them. I *may* keep visiting the virtual world, but the company behind this app, uh, they got some things to answer for, and/or work to do.

After a week of all of that, I sat down and realized that, despite this all being virtual, none of it being a real *tangible* thing in real life ... I've put nearly ten years of work into my Second Life store, and just dropping it on a dime, and letting go of it didn't sit right with me. So I jumped back in, I fashioned myself a brand new avatar based on the one I *began* Second Life with, and then I snatched up a very small parcel within my budget to re-build my store.

In the midst of this, someone within the [REVOSA] store group saw what I was doing, sent me a message, and brought me to his *full sim*, and handed me 1000 land impact to work with, *completely free of charge*. This was [already detailed](/second life/2024/08/25/revosa-saved-from-the-brink-of-death/) a few posts ago on this site, but I am very grateful.

To commemorate my store being quickly revived, I'm putting out a brand new set of shorts for the Nano Nexus line: The McFly Edition! Fit for Maitreya, Legacy, and Reborn, these shorts come in a holographic coloring not at all unlike a hat Marty might have worn in Back to the Future 2.

You can see it [here](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-McFly-Edition/26334413){:target="_blank"}, on the marketplace, or visit [REVOSA]'s [brand new location](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Gingivere/210/94/3996){:target="_blank"} and mingle while you try a demo.

I am, again, very grateful that my store gets to stay in-world, and I look forward to *actually* making new things on a possibly consistent basis!
