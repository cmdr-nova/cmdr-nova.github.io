Not to be too personal, and with names censored due to this being the internet, but I think I might be *ready* to be done working for the company that I'm at. I told myself in January, that something had to change. Something big needed to change, or happen, because my life feels like it's going in circles, and nothing's ever really getting to where I need, or *want* it to be. And now, I'm kind of at this crossroads.

An intersection where I just suck it up, and work in a position I've literally never been interested in, just because it's two extra dollars an hour, and risk hating it, not doing well *at all*, and possibly even maybe lose my job *because of that*, or ... I do something I haven't done in years.

I leave.

I take a risk, and I start working for myself.

Ever since the era of covid began, gig-jobs have erupted, and *never* gone away. I firmly believe it's likely the future that people will just do work assigned to them through apps, at their own pace, with their own set hours and schedule.

Of course, my ultimate goal is to just be a web developer.

But, since it seems to be *extremely hard to find a career where I can get a shoe-in*, I'm looking at gig work as my next step.

Most corporations with zero-skill entry won't pay you much, and it takes *years* before you're making *just enough* to get by.

But I'm tired of making *just enough* to *hardly* get by, what with, massive amounts of debt, and all. Why keep doing that, keep making money at a set rate that can't change, with restricted over-time that you *can't have* at all times, whenever you want ...

When I can download an app, jump in my car, and go make money *whenever the hell I want*?

Is it a risk? Yeah, probably.

I still haven't yet decided if I'm going to make this jump.

My body, though, I feel, is at a breaking point, where it just can't do this anymore.

I can't be pushed into a position I didn't ask for. I can't keep running around on my feet for eight to ten hours a day and still have energy to ... *have a life*. I'm relatively healthy. Quite a bit older than I was the last time I tried to do things for myself, and yet, it's like they say. It's never too late to make a change, right?
