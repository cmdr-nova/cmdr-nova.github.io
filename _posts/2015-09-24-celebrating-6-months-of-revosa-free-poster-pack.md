So today I decided to put together some of my best photos and advertisements for REVOSA, slap them on some prims and add a shadow map for added quality. Why? Because it's been six months since I started REVOSA, which, as mentioned before, started as a very tiny operation out of a virtual garage and grew into something much, much larger.<br />
<br />
You can grab the poster pack <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Free-REVOSA-Poster-Pack/7789278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, on the marketplace, or by visiting <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Pisces/172/239/29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my inworld mainstore</a> and grabbing it from one of my vendors across the great wall of stuff!<br />
<br />
Included in this poster pack are two REVOSA advertisements, a photo of Lula not looking at an explosion and a bonus explicit photo taken during Crystal Falls roleplay, which, sadly, no longer exists, aside from within my Flickr album memorial. That particular album can be viewed <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHskk6mabM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Today is also a "break" day for me, so I'll be releasing no new products until tomorrow, stay tuned, and REV it up!
