In the few hours I have to myself tonight, I'd like to update interested peoples and parties on what's happening with things I'm building in Second Life. As most know, I shut down my city/the homestead a few months back. It's really hard to justify spending 110+ USD a month on something that's not making me any returns, and people really only visited on and off in short bursts. No fault of their own, I just mostly *always* lack the energy for reaching out and building community. But, my Second Life journey is also kind of empty and hollow without owning a piece of land, with things that I've built, so ...

I found some mainland that I like, I bought just enough that gives me nearly 3000 land impact that I could use, *with* my store being part of it (because my store *has* to come first, and *must* have an in-world location at all times), for a fairly much more decent price. It's sustainable, and I can at least build *something*.

I've done this a few times before with this place I call "THE DREDGE", or, a smaller cut of Neo Machina, built to fit a piece of land that isn't the size of a personal island. Both of the previous times I did it, it was cool, and people were visiting, but! ... I went overboard, both times, and was paying for way more land than I needed, and therefore costing *too much*.

I think I've nailed it this time, and am being a bit more methodical about it. Planning what I want to do, what I want to build. Surveying the land that already exists around the land that I *do* own, and looking at how I can make it look as though it's connected to the rest of the community.

I *think* I'm going to prop up the rentable apartment buildings, just so that people can have at it once again, but I may change it a bit. I remember complaints in the past about having such large spaces available, with small amounts of prims that could be placed, and it does make sense. Why have a huge livable space, but you can only place enough to fill the size of maybe like ... a bedroom?

So, maybe I'll build a *new* apartment building? We'll see.

I need to slap down some streets, get these placeholder prims replaced with actual buildings. Figure out what I want to do *besides* just offer a place for people to live if they should choose. 

Do I want to put my little nightclub back? Do I want to try and actually *run it* this time? Do I want to do something *completely different* and new?

Whatever it is I decide I want to do, it'll have to wait until tomorrow to get into real motion, because I have no time to myself tonight! Thank you ... offline job.

Anyway, that's the update for now, denizens. I won't be sharing a link to the land until it's ready for people to actually visit (although, people who live around the area have already wandered inside to look at this cluster of white placeholders probably thinking, what the hell).
