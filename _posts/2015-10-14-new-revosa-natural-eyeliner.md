New from REVOSA, the first product in our line of facial cosmetics, natural eyeliner!<br />
<br />
Liner comes in 4 different version, all with a little bit of shadow. Colors are black, white, black &amp; white and red.<br />
<br />
You may have noticed that the face is different, and this is because I've decided to return to using a system body head. One, because I want to do a product line of different types of facial cosmetics and two, because the TMP head just isn't allowing for the customization I'm used to (and in 2 and a half weeks, I haven't heard back from their team about appliers/installers).<br />
