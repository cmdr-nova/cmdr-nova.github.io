Sometimes I don't know what to write, and this has been happening a lot lately. I'll be home from work, free to do whatever, and I'll do nothing but stare blank at Youtube while the voice of a stranger drones on about technology, or really bad Instagram ads. Meanwhile I've got a beast of a Linux machine and a rock-solid Macbook sitting in front of me with endless possibilities, and instead I listen to the sound of the air conditioning and the cricket that chirps, stuck inside of it. The wind that sometimes beats against the side of the house, and the periodic rain that pelts the roof.

I find a lot of the times, I'm just fine in the silence, *alone*, without any need for all that much physical human interaction. Something I used to feel like I *needed* most days. Not sure what happened, there.

I talk a lot about being in a lack-of-energy mode, where I just can't will myself to do much once I walk out the door of my job, and sit down in my car. I don't even *know* if it's the job at this point. Maybe it's just a culmination of ... well, *everything*.

A lot's happened these past three decades, you know?

I sat down one day in 2008 and started writing a book. Got coached by another writer in order to make it through that whole process over the course of four years, and then he passed away in 2018 and I *still* haven't let go of his memory. I left my job, got *forced* out of it, basically, and honestly, and I isolated myself for five years. I built up this thing in Second Life, and I started a whole music career, and I kept writing. Meanwhile my identity shifted back and forth, and then I shoved it all away so that I could just return to the workforce. Just walk right back into square-one like nothing happened.

Like, disillusionment. After all's said and done, and everything I had done up to that point, it's all still just the same as it's always been.

Then I had some flawed dive into the NFT community and made a bunch of money ... that has been gone for quite some time, mind you. But I was *famous*, for fives minutes, when the official Twitter account (pre-Musk) shared *my work* to *millions of people* (some of which wished me dead). I think about that every once in a while, though: The one time I'm *extremely* successful (outside of having a best-selling darksynth album), and it's something that caused a bunch of online friends to ditch me without a word. On a heel, in seconds, never to be heard from again.

Don't even get me started on the blunders of the many communities online that I've been part of, from synthwave and its community of narcissistic tyrants, to numerous Mastodon servers and the many personality cults, to a massive Discord server I used to run that got obliterated from just two people sharing illegal anime porn in one of my channels. God dang, that's a whole story in and of itself I don't even wanna begin to revisit, let alone revisit any of these other ... moments in time that were less than desirable.

And now I find myself in this constant battle with my mind to ... *retain* myself. Who I *am*. I let my mind occupy space at work, and *it stays there*. It won't leave. Then I get home, and I spend *just enough time* there doing what I want to do, and what I need to do, and my mind shifts into another space. Sometimes it's hard to escape that space, and I end up feeling discombobulated when I eventually return to work. It's a cycle at this point. A cycle that I wonder might be a symptom of *being a writer*.

I don't know.

If I'm not *thinking*, if I'm not writing, if I'm not *creating*, I don't feel like anything. And despite not being famous at the moment, not being a millionaire, not being completely self reliant, I've also simultaneously done *more* than a lot of people ever will in their own lifetimes.

It's the kind of thing that makes you feel dizzy.

It's makes me wonder, "Maybe this is why I'm so tired all the time."

I don't write these things to gloat, either. I sometimes *wish* I could be as simple as, work, go home, watch some TV, then sleep. But I just don't know how anyone is content with that. I don't think I ever could be. But hey, maybe my problem is that I just never got married. Dated like 20, 25, 30 some-odd people, or something. I don't even know anymore. But marriage? You gotta be kidding me, bro.

You mean I gotta interact with someone, *daily*? Psh. Hmph. WHAT?

I remember when I used to wallow in self pity when I *wasn't* dating someone, or that I couldn't find someone who was *just right*. And then I read somewhere online, like you do, that the average person dates like [seven people in their whole lives](https://her.ie/life/whats-your-number-study-finds-the-average-number-of-dates-and-relationships-before-we-find-the-one-90330){:target="_blank"}, and I'm like ... Hold up, you're joking, right?

No, they *ain't* joking.

Anyway, I'm not really writing this to make a statement, or say anything significant. It's just, we'll call it, an open journal. Expressing everything that's ever happened in as small a chunk as possible, in a way to go ... Well, this is what I think about sometimes!

The more you know ...
