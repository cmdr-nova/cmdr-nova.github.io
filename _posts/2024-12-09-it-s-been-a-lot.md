I haven't written very much on my blog in the past week. I haven't done so, mostly, because a lot has been going on in the world, and my head is spinning! In my personal life, I'm moving positions at work, so there's a stressor, but not *too stressy*, because it's a position I'm familiar with. And then in the real world, BAM. A health insurance CEO gets murked, and then there's a multi-day manhunt, and it ends ... with bro eating a burger at McDonalds?

I'm sure by now the whole entire internet has heard about the UHC assassination, and I'm also sure almost the entire internet *didn't give a flying fart* that some billionaire who has caused the deaths of thousands (maybe even millions??) was killed. A life for many lives, seems fair? But then the shooter, whoms't we'll just call Luigi, since he's been picked up by the cops ... jumps on a bike, dumps a backpack, and then 3 days later emerges in Pennsylvania for a burger. At which point an elderly employee snitches on him.

Then the whirlwind comes out, and <a href="https://x.com/PepMangione" target="_blank">his Twitter</a> is unearthed, and his political leanings are as confusing as wrapping your head around how someone who was so careful from the start, ended up at McDonalds with all of the evidence the cops would need to arrest him. (/me breathes out) But, maybe he planned it that way? You know? Your face is on security cameras flirting with someone at a hostel (they have hostels in New York? They don't just call them shared motels? The heck?), and maybe you figure, "Damn, uh, I am probably going to get caught, huh."

And then he flips a switch and his Youtube starts uploading videos. The first one comes and it says something about how everything's planned, and more is coming ... "soon." And then there's a quick flash of the date, "December 11th."

A couple of hours later, another video premiere begins on a 45 minute timer, and this is all you see ...

<img src="/img/posts/uhc/binary.png">

For those who don't know, or don't want to decipher it, this is binary code that reads, "The Truth will set me free."

About 20 minutes into the timer, Google / Youtube stepped in and deleted the entire channel. Although, I seriously *doubt* the content he had scheduled was deleted. I'm *sure* that's on a Google server waiting to be sent to the police in Altoona or New York (whichever). But ... that'll be interesting to see, if *ever*.

Now, there are *other* things, like his praise of the Unabomber on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4065667863" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> where he *also* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/10j1le5/comment/j5i4x9z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">quotes a Reddit user</a> in his thoughts on the book, and the world, in-general. And an apparent Instagram account, which ... I won't even *try* to find, as people flock to the site making new accounts under the man's name in a vapid, shallow attempt at getting a ton of followers really quick before the story dies down (frikken opportunists).

I think it all brings together a rightful distaste for corporate America, and how our society is run. In that, *it sucks a whole lot of ass, and it ain't getting any better.* But, if you were hoping his politics would be pure, so that it would be easier for you to excuse him: Good luck. In one moment he's an anti-capitalist, and in the next he's a traditionalist talking about birth rates in Japan.

If you were expecting someone who would 3D-print half of a Glock (a ghost gun), and then shoot someone in broad daylight to make total sense, *think again.*

But, despite all of this, there is something *else* to takeaway from it. The reaction, the millions of people *all over the country*, cheering him on. Cheering on the assassination, with rage, and sighs of *relief*, that *finally*, one of these bastards experienced a consequence for all of the evil they manifest in their day-to-day lives.

And I don't blame them.
