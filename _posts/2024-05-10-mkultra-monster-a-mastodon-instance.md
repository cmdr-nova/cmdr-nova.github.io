<p>If you're seeing this from the Fediverse, it's because I have my self-hosted Wordpress blog using plugins that connect it directly via something of a pseudo instance. Each post on my blog is also a post on the Fediverse, and although I <em>can</em> follow users from Wordpress, it's not exactly bug free, in that I can't turn off e-mail updates that rip and tear at my daily mail limits on SendGrid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's why, despite having every post via cmdr-nova.online fed directly into ActivityPub, I also have my own (managed hosting) instance, also on a domain that I own, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mkultra.monster</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm posting about this, because I want people to honestly join, help build a community, and <em>maybe</em> support my efforts to keep it rolling (right now, all of these things are coming out-of-pocket).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What kind of community would you be joining and/or fostering?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>MKM is an LGBTQ+ friendly instance, loosely based around the concepts of community, connection, and the ideas of the old-net. But, most importantly, MKM is wholeheartedly and completely <em>against</em> "AI" (and nazis, reactionaries, and hate in-general).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any and all use, mention, or sharing of generated (plagiarized/stolen) material is an immediate ban, without question. This goes for <em>any</em> instance that connects to MKM. Obviously, being critical of AI/LLMs is not bannable and is encouraged! The more the heartless tech dudes have to face down the actual consequences of their joy in the destruction of creativity, the worse they'll feel. And boy, do I love making them feel bad.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm also posting this, though, because, in the future (and possibly right now), I will (and do) need some help with moderation, and am looking for two people who may be interested, whom <em>I can trust</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Too often, I've joined instances in the past, and have butted heads with moderators and admins simply because they're <em>bad at what they do</em>. They invade your direct messages to scold you, they ban you for clashing with a troll, and so on and so forth. This is not the type of behavior a decent moderation team would engage in. A community moderator should have the good sensibility to be able to decipher easily who the troll is and who the genuine person is in an argument, or clash. A good CM shouldn't jump into your DMs to nastily wave a finger at you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't think these are tough guidelines to follow, but as I've said, I've seen this behavior, and I've seen those people continue to be admins and moderators in the greater Fediverse community, to the tune of <em>no consequences whatsoever</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But joining MKM isn't about getting revenge on the bad community teams out in the Fediverse. It's about maintaining and creating a better one. One you can join, and know, that <em>even if</em> you have some bad days, or sometimes even terrible days, you aren't going to literally lose your place on Mastodon, and have to start all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel like the largest barrier between Twitter hold-outs and Mastodon, is that people feel uneasy about possibly having to start all over, again, and again. And trust me, choom, I've done it over and over. At least, until I erected MKM.</p>

<p>Take all of this into consideration, and maybe I'll see <em>you</em> there! Just use the link further up in this post to check it out.</p>
