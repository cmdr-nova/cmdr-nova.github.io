Today I was looking for things to write about while I push through the main story quests in Zenless Zone Zero. Which, might I add, has like, 400 million lines of dialogue to move through in-between all the latter half of the game's action. But, it was suggested to me via <a href="https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks" target="_blank">@shellsharks</a> that I take the, "Which HTML element are you quit?" (you can <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/13/html-quiz" target="_blank">find that here</a>)

And, it turns out, I am the "canvas" element.
