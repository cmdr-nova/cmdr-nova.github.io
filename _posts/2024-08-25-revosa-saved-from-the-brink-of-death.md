It was a little over a week ago now that I got hit with some pretty hefty charges for automotive repair offline, *you know*, in the real world. I've been trying to raise a little bit of money in order to soften the impact of this a bit, and you can totally read more about that [here](/fundraiser/2024/08/17/urgent-financial-help-needed).

But, because of that hit, I made the best decision possible for my financial situation, and an unfortunate one for what I do in Second Life, and decided that it would be best to shutdown the city I built. This *also* came with shutting down [REVOSA]'s in-world presence completely.

That ... was a week ago.

Now it's Sunday, August 25th, and as I was looking for options, *some* kind of option, to *keep* [REVOSA] online within the virtual world, I nabbed a very tiny 512sqm spot, and began to build.

*While* I was doing this, I got a direct message from someone who'd been watching what was going on in the Second Life [REVOSA] group, and ... he offered me a sizable plot on a full sim with access to 1000 land impact.

This is about what I was using at Neo Machina before I decided it needed to be shutdown.

If you see Logan Bamaisin (Laufiair Hexicola) in-world at the space station, make sure you give him a hello and a thank you for keeping [REVOSA] not only online, but also in the kind of space it deserves, being almost *ten years olds*, at this point.

You can check out the brand new store location, [here](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Gingivere/210/96/3996){:target="_blank"}.

That's all I've got for now, it's time to get building!
