That's right! Another chapter is finished! In this chapter we come back to reality, whatever that means when you're trapped inside of a place where the laws physics mean nothing, and we learn even more new things.<br />
<br />
Back in the seventies a signal was discovered in a pocket of dark space, no planets, no stars, nothing. This signal came to be named the "Wow!" signal and is a real thing you can listen to on youtube, <a href="https://youtu.be/OkycNvrpjCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br />
<br />
As Jennfier, the ships A.I. intercepts a strange signal that is assumed to have slipped over the event horizon, she discovers that this signal was being broadcast at 1420 megahertz, and that not only is it a distress signal, but likely the <i>same</i> signal that was discovered in the seventies, way back on Earth before everything died.<br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
You tell me.<br />
