In my last post on here, I mentioned that I had started writing web development guides, but got interrupted by work, and tiredness. Well, do I have news for you. Today, I had off of work, and after having some caffeine and breakfast this morning, I spent about eight hours writing through nine different guides, from getting started with ultra-basic HTML, to constructing JavaScript that makes updating links while having many pages, *way easy*, to getting setup on Neocities.

If you've never made a website before, or are interested in learning things, I'm confidence <a class="page-link" href="/pages/webdev/">these guides</a> will do *something* for you, in the very least.

And, although it's shown on the guide page itself, <a href="/webdev/basics/examples/index9.html" target="_blank">here's the finished website</a> you'll be making alongside the guides.

This took ... a lot of time to write, and there are some things that could be more technically explained, but I think I've at least done *enough* that someone new to web development can *at least* get started. If even you just copy and paste what I've written in order to hack around and mess with stuff. I mean. That's fine too!

Either way, enjoy. I'm going to go take a break.
