<p>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice finally has a trailer (did I say Beetlejuice enough times?) and I feel it looks interesting, maybe pretty cool, but where are the Maitlands?</p>

<p>I did some reading from a few searches on the quickly declining Google, and it appears the original actors (Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis) <a href="https://screenrant.com/beetlejuice-2-geena-davis-return-no-confirmed-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be reprising</a> their roles because ... "Ghosts don't age." And that's all fine and dandy, but I have a rebuttal!</p>

<p>It's <em>fiction</em>.</p>

<p>As a writer, you could easily slip something into the script, like, "Well, usually ghosts don't age, but the effects of Sandworms and Saturn cause unexpected side effects." And that's just spit-balling. I didn't even put <em>any</em> thought into that.</p>

<p>One of the main comedic, or the best parts of the original film, Beetlejuice, <em>were</em> the Maitlands. Because they were just regular normal people who suddenly died. Regular, boring people who didn't really do anything remarkable besides own a nice house out in the country. I feel like removing that, kind of, sort of, removes a part of Beetlejuice.</p>

<p>But hey, we also don't have the full movie yet, and I'm definitely going to go see it while wearing a black and white striped shirt. Because ... I believe I am now as old as Michael Keaton was when he starred in the original role.</p>

<p>To think in 36 years I could be writing about Beetlejuice again, but for very different reasons.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't know, though, what do you think? Is Beetlejuice Beetlejuice minus the Maitlands feeling like a net positive, or negative to you?</p>

<p>As a side note, it's my birthday on Sunday (the 26th), so I'm not going to ramble on too long in my posts this weekend. I'd like a little bit of rest, you know? But you should check out <a href="https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/05/20/gofundme-debt-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my debt relief fundraiser</a> and share it around.</p>
