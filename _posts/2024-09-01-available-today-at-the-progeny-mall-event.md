![ad card for a set of glitchy windows 95 looking shorts in Second Life](/img/posts/os95/os95_ad.png)

For the first time since 2016, [REVOSA] is actively participating in a shopping event! Starting today, the Nano Nexus OS95 Edition shorts are available exclusively, [here](http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Progeny/160/116/21){:target="_blank"}, and until the end of the month! 

>Progeny Mall is an event created by the Progeny team, which helps designers mingle with the Progeny community and showcase their exclusives every month.

The OS95 shorts are part of an ongoing set within my store that I was working on earlier in the year, and had paused for a long period of time. Once picking up the mantle again, after deciding not to drop the ball after the closure of my homestead/sim, I churned out a few new pairs, including *this one*.

Styled after the aesthetics of the nineties and Windows 95, these shorts are perfect for the weird, the quirky, and the nineties kids, even if only at heart.

Grab yourself a pair, today!
