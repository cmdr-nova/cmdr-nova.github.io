Yesterday I posted about launching a Sharkey instance, and liking it so much, I decided to *move to it*, and move off of the managed Mastodon instance I had. Now that I've done that, it's time to get back to work in figuring out how I can integrate my Sharkey instance into my website (such as like inserting my post feed into a side-bar, having trending topics on my side-bar, and so on).

What I would like to mention, since they've been pretty awesome since I started with them, and up until yesterday when I decided to turn off the instance: <a href="https://toot.io/mastodon_hosting.html" target="_blank">Toot.io</a>

These guys have provided an *extremely* solid Mastodon experience for me for most of the year. Little to *no* issues, elastic search built-in, on-time updates, and *even when I was having some financial issues*, they worked with me in order to keep my instance from making me go broke in the short term.

I'm now currently running my own copy of Sharkey over at Elest.io, and they've been alright so far, but the experience is mostly *in my own hands*, since I now maintain the instance, plus the structure behind it.

But! If you're interested in hosting a very simple Mastodon instance, and want *little* to fuss with, or even *setup*, I highly recommend Toot.io hosting. I even felt kind of bad turning off my Mastodon instance, *just because* they've been so good this whole time. But I yearned for more, and Sharkey has the more I'm looking for.

That doesn't mean *you* should launch your own instance of alternative ActivityPub software, though! If you're *new* to this, and maybe don't know how to use a command line, or a terminal, *absolutely* get yourself some managed hosting.

That's it, that's the post.
