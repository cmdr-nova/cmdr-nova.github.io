I haven't really written here all that much in the past couple weeks, and it's not entirely because I don't want to, or don't feel like it. I mean, you can see me posting daily on Akkoma from right here on the site. But, I'm deep into the night shift at work now, and coupled with the ten hour shifts, and the constant overtime ... I'm tired?

I have a whole album I need to work on, a book I want to get back to writing, and this website that I want to continue writing on, and I'm going to do all of that. When I can figure out how to rebalance my life so that *other things still fit into it*.

I kind of feel like a ghost a lot of the time, because I come home, feed my Minecraft addiction, and then sleep, wake up, shower, and head back to work.

It's taken over so much of my life, that I'm swiping on dating apps *while I walk through hallways* at work. It's not that I couldn't do this at home, but more like I just don't have the energy for anything right now. And that's not good. Time is passing us by!

But some of this *does* have to do with me constantly being in Minecraft. I don't know. I just feel like building and digging out mines! But, there's the book in the back of my mind asking me when I'm going to continue writing it. If I'm going to get over the anxiety of the internet being filled with scammers and grifters who want to just steal everything for their own selfish wants. When did the internet get so bad?

Again, I miss the days of Geocities. The age of the 90s when the only thing crawling the internet, *was you*.

Anyway, that's what's going on here. Me, being sleepy.
