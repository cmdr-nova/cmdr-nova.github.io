Keeping up with my finnicky tradition of always moving my store around in Second Life about once every six months (at this point), I've transferred land ownership back to the account that *actually runs the store*, and moved to a better parcel! This comes, after realizing I made a huge mistake with my finances in relation to Linden Labs, and being someone who uses *multiple accounts*. That's a big oof on my part.

Still with all the same products, and room to add more, you can now find my Second Life store, in-world, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Necrotee/218/233/3551" target="_blank">here</a>.

I made this move, because I wasn't too happy with the tiny amount of space I had in the old spot, and I was shuffling around expenses and found out ... I've been paying Linden Labs for a large amount of land for probably *well over a year*, unknowingly. Being that, I somehow *forgot* that I was doing this. So, I moved everything around, found a new location, put the store online *in that new location*, and then turned off all transactions on my alt account.

Now ... the only account paying for anything, *should be the account running the store!*

Whew.

Anyway, on-wards and forwards into the new year!
