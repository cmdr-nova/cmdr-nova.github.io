I knew someday this day would come. When my ambitions of starting a store out of desperation, in need of an income of sorts, of *any*, would *eventually* come to an end. Sometimes it's a molehill, and sometimes it's a mountain.

It's not really a secret that I've been struggling with credit card debt *ever since* I had to take my previously passed-away cat to the vets, wherein I was slammed with over 3000 dollars USD worth of medical bills.

That was almost two years ago now, and I think I've only chipped away at that debt.

The weight of this was heavy *enough*. Working, not really being able to afford much more than entertainment and pleasantries. And saving a little here, and a little there.

It's not really untrue that my Second Life store *doesn't* make any money. It *does*. It brings in about 20 dollars worth of sales every month, and has done, for years, and years. Most of that money is generated from online marketplace sales that people do casually, in their internet browsers.

Well. Today I took my car in for inspection, and lo and behold, it needs some serious work done in order to pass that inspection, and that serious work will cost me about 1900 dollars USD. I don't have a credit card that can support a charge this high. I'm *still paying on veterinarian fees from two years ago*.

So, out of pocket, is the way I have to go. With money I've been trying to save. Money I've been keeping as a pillow, some kind of cushion. Money that will be gone in an instant, and put me back into a place I haven't been for five years.

It is with much regret, that I've decided to, along with canceling a majority of my subscriptions that I've had, purely for entertainment sake, that I also must close my store. At least in-world.

[REVOSA] will now exist solely on the Second Life marketplace website, and I believe, after almost ten years, this is fine. The store had a great run in-world, and I've had a lot of fun over the years. Its necessity though, is no longer a priority I can manage, and the amount of money Linden Labs charges in order to keep these things running is no longer something I can rightfully support. Not while I'm facing down these massive charges, *just so* I can have a vehicle to get to and from work.

I don't know if anyone was hoping that it would stick around, but to anyone who was, I apologize.

Maybe someday, when credit card companies aren't sucking the life out of me, and mechanics aren't taking everything I own for a car repair, we can start this all over again.

But, until then ...
