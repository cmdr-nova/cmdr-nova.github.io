It's been a while since I've written about the egregious battle of attrition basically *anyone* who does *anything* creative has been having with AI generated sludge. The way I deal with it, is by simply blocking and reporting every single instance of it that I see on *every single social platform*. But, is that enough?

Is it enough, when accounts like this sign up on a fediverse instance and just start spamming the federated feed with glossy garbage that 100% *more than likely* has stolen the likeness of a real person, and other people's work?

Is it *enough*, when not only do accounts like this pop up on Mastodon and Bluesky, but they'll also include something in their social bio, like, "committed to celebrating the arts and enriching the cultural landscape." Which, for all intents and purposes, is an insult to intelligent people, and an insult to anyone who actually *does* anything.

This is just *one* example, and I include it in this post, because it was especially annoying to see, today.

It reeks of indifferent, superficial influencer-syndrome.

But, maybe we need to start calling this *utter shit* what it is: The fascist destruction of the arts.

During the rise of Nazi Germany, the fascist party decided for the population what they believed to be *acceptable* art, and disposed of the rest (see: <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/degenerate-art-1" target="_blank">degenerate art</a>). This can easily be correlated to the way AI generated "art" is used in modern society, *because every single bit of it is created and controlled by oligarchs who seek to remove and replace real humans with inauthentic algorithms,* and much of it is deployed on corporate social media in order to *aid* misinformation campaigns by those *same* oligarchs, and their fascist handlers in the government.

Also, take note that *a lot* of AI generative theft is geared toward <a href="https://www.404media.co/chinese-ai-video-generators-unleash-a-flood-of-new-nonconsensual-porn-3/" target="_blank">non-consensual porn</a>, *but that's no surprise*, because the entire grift is based on a complete lack of consent.

Outside of these aspects, anyone else is just using it to "make" things they want to see, and then claiming that they've *done* something, that it's *their* work (even though 99.9% of the time it looks like utter trash).

But, why?

A fascist is incapable of creating. A fascist can only destroy.

Generative AI is fascist. Stop sharing AI, stop posting slop, and push these parasites *off* of community-owned social media, before they're allowed to invade, unhindered.

No, I don't care if the instance you're on makes exceptions for AI slop in that as long as a user discloses that it's AI, they're allowed. If you ask me, that's too soft. Admins and moderators on Mastodon, especially, *have got to stop being soft*.

End of discussion.
