<p>Over the past couple of months, or, since the beginning of the year, I've been tinkering around with moving, completely, toward ActivityPub. From taking my Twitter activity and killing it in its entirety so that I can run my instance at <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about">mkultra</a>, to replacing Instagram with my <a href="https://gram.social/i/web/profile/688161366026192587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pixelfed</a>, to replacing Youtube with my <a href="https://diode.zone/c/callmenova/videos?languageOneOf=en&amp;s=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peertube</a>, and also now, my blog!</p>

<p>The only real thing I have left is to find a Lemmy instance that I actually like, and replace my Reddit activity with Lemmy. Which, in all honesty, shouldn't be too hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, why do all this? Why abandon the corporate overlords to have full and complete control over everything I post, and my identity online?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mean, that's it right there.</p>

<p>I <em>would</em> like to migrate my Patreon subscribers, here, to my blog/website, since it <em>does</em> have <a href="https://cmdr-nova.online/subscribe/">tiered paid subscriptions</a> (mostly just for financial support), but that's a whole other beast. I'm not sure how many of them would be comfortable doing that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now though, I think I'm happy with my continued migration away from corpo mumbo-jumbo. I believe the future of the internet is an open internet, while the corporations fumble around with themselves vying to retain users for as long as possible before they <em>all</em> discover just exactly what ActivityPub is, and how they can use it seperately from the moneyed-billionaire software.</p>

<p>Meta is, of course, connecting Threads to ActivityPub, but I don't think <em>enough</em> people who are on there know, or care, about what AP is, or what it means to be on Threads vs. a Mastodon instance. I have, currently, a lot of mixed feelings about Threads connecting to Mastodon. I think it's great because it brings more users in and more potential contact and exposure with the greater internet, but it also brings in Meta's lax moderation. Meta's fever-pitch obsession with AI (see: theft, plagiarism), and potential for abuse (this is the reason why I've now decided to limit the instance to only the people I decide to follow from Threads).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, like most things that sidetrack all of my thoughts, Meta's cloudy connection to ActivityPub is an on-going thing that my opinions and feelings about evolve over time.</p>

<p>For now, thanks for stopping by!</p>
