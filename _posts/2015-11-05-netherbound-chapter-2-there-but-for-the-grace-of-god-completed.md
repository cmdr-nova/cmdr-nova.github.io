That's right! I spent most of the day pounding out the second chapter of NETHERBOUND. It's a little shorter but it explains a lot. We start from the point at which Escape Velocity (the previous novel) ended and we skew it, we warp it and we connect it in fragmented shards that tell little significant details about what exactly happened.<br />
<br />
He's awoken 223 years into the future, but this fact is not mentioned, yet.<br />
<br />
He's incarcerated and blamed for wiping out most of humanity<br />
<br />
He escapes prison, regardless and reunites with a mysterious and unexplained version of Meryl SinGarda, and then we find out that he is no longer he, or Dante.<br />
<br />
This chapter is where I tie the two books together, provide some closure for the extremely anticlimactic end to Escape Velocity and provide the framework for the rest of NETHERBOUD. So if you've read Escape Velocity and you're dying to know just what the hell happens next, you can now not only find out where we are in the story, but how (sort of) we got there.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for chapter 3, "<i><b>Transmission From Hell</b></i>."<br />
