You might look at the headline, "I spent two days playing World of Warcraft," and go, "What is this, 2008?" And, honestly? I wish it was. But, the past it is not. Recently, I had a position change at work, and now I have to sleep during the day. But, an added bonus? I work longer days, and have more days off. So, I decided to take a sizeable chunk of that time off, and get back into the World of Warcraft. But, how long have I had characters in this game?

This is one of the oldest characters on my account ... Mokklerblitz, the Death Knight. I created this character *on the day* that Wrath of the Lich King launched, in the hours when the servers had come back online. I wish I could show you what this character looked like, *then*, rather than now, in War Within ... but, keeping record of my screenshots in 2008 (or even 2004) wasn't really something I did.

But, I spent a couple days (okay, maybe not two entire full days straight) grinding in WoW, in order to get my set of four main characters caught-up with War Within.

It's been far too many years since I really went all out and *actually played* through an expansion in World of Warcraft. Which, is pretty *nuts*, because I've pre-ordered ... *every single one of them.*

I still have the Cataclysm special edition box sitting on a shelf here.

Anyway, I didn't start playing World of Warcraft as a Death Knight in 2008. I started as a Night Elf Druid (which is now pictured above to the far left), and then I was bribed by friends at the time (with in-game gold) to join the Horde, and play there. Which I did. On a mage.

I don't have that mage anymore.

I won't say *why*, exactly, but let's just say, this was before Battle.net accounts, and people sometimes swapped characters between each other.

Never-the-less, I *wish* I still had that character.

I feel, though, World of Warcraft has come a long way. There's *so much content* that it's kind of ridiculous if you somehow run out of things to do. *There's so much to do* you could probably spend the next decade completing it, and then you'd have probably four more expansions to run.

What I miss, though, is something that not even the Classic servers can really capture. That's partially, because, for *some reason*, they decided that part of Classic should just ... run through *every single expansion* until it catches up with the Retail version.

I don't think that was needed. I think we needed three servers for the first three expansions, and then they could've just stopped there.

But what do I know? Cataclysm, at least, didn't need a "classic" edition on these servers. One of the *very reasons* I think people *even wanted* classic servers, was to *experience the game before Cataclysm vastly changed everything!*

Sometimes I wish I could log in again for the first time in 2004, create a Night Elf, and die repeatedly, mesmerized as to what exactly was happening.

"Why am I a glowing ball? Where do I go? What the heck is this? I'm lost!" And then re-rez, and do it all over again.

No, my *favorite*, "I'm a noob and I don't know what MMOs are" thing, was when I ran from Darnassus to Ironforge, on foot, at level one, because I wanted to see what it looked like. And then I found out that my graphics card couldn't handle it, *so I ran to Walmart and bought a new one*.

That was back when Walmart still sold videocards, and when videocards didn't cost as much as a used car due to crypto and AI grifters jacking up demand.

But I spent two days playing, and it felt like I was 19 years old again, in some points. I ignored most of the world. Ignored social media, ignored the constant onslaught of notifications from millions of different sources that demand your attention only to *waste it*, and I leveled the hell up. I just leveled up, dude.

Did this improve my dating life? Hell no. Date? Who dates in this economy?

Did I almost feel like things were normal for short stints over a two day period? Sort of. But ... with a whole lot less friends.

On that note, got a guild? I'm looking for one on my Alliance Druid! The one I joined yesterday is *dead in the water*. Hit me up!
