For about four or five months, I've been using Wordpress to push out all my larger thoughts, ideas, and musings. I have to admit, Wordpress is pretty simple, and very convenient. It requires a whole lot of just ... typing what you want, and then slapping post, and nothing else! Unfortunately, after some careful consideration, I decided that I kind of missed hacking into code. So, I moved some repos around, switched branches, and launched a new version of my website via Github in Ruby, i.e., Jekyll.

*This is the hacker experience.*

This *does* mean I have to move all the posts over that I want to keep, but that's not really a whole lot of trouble, since I have it all backed up, easy peasy.

One of the main reasons I'm also doing this though, is that hosting my own website on a VPS is *also* costly. It's money I don't need to be spending, when I can throw something down onto Github, and continually update it as I see fit, and then share links. It kind of seems like a no-brainer. And, if for some reason I lose my ability to *pay* for things, my website goes nowhere. It's still here.

The other reason I'm doing this is because, like I mentioned in the first paragraph, I *miss* writing code, and doing things over the command line for my website. Not only that, but actually customizing Wordpress is a gigantic pain in the ass, and I can't entirely do everything that I want to do. You might think a static blog running on Ruby wouldn't be so versatile, but it is! If you're viewing this post right now, everything probably looks really basic. But that'll change. I have limited time outside of work, so the most important thing is just getting everything running. Then, comes the rest.

The posting process is a little more involved, though, just the way I like it. I create drafts on the command line, and then edit them in VS Code. Once finished, I publish over the command line, and then push to Git so that Jekyll can rebuild with the new content I've created.

Hurrah! I'm a content creator!

Now, the process of moving everything over manually is something I've decided to do, not because Wordpress wasn't able to export. Oh no, I *got* my posts exported from Wordpress. But the formatting it generates for Jekyll is completely wrong, and entirely fuggled up. So I'm just going to gradually dig through what I've posted over there, edit it, and then put them up here and make it look as though it was always here.

Easy, peasy.

But, ay, that's really all I wanted to post about for now. Onward, into the future!
