Earlier last night, I wrote about how I don't know, or don't think that discussion forums can be saved. And, I thought about it for a while. How do I know something can't be saved, if I haven't tried to fix the problem myself? So, I launched my own old-school PHPBB forum!

Basically, at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">MKULTRA Board</a>, I copy/pasted a *huge* part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010401015509/http://animeboards.com:80/" target="_blank">the old anime forum</a> I used to be part of back in 1999-2001 (somewhere in that era), and then added my own things.

I did this, because I've missed it greatly. So much so, that, *years back*, I contacted the original owner and asked if he'd be willing to part with the database and software, so that it could be resurrected. Unfortunately, if I recall, he wasn't too interested in doing that, or felt like it would be too much of a hassle, or cost too greatly.

I don't know about that. I'm running the new forum on a 16 dollar VPS, and it's pretty smooth!

Now, obviously, if, *for some reason*, it attracts thousands of people, then *yes*, it would require much more in hosting.

But, here's *something*. Will you register and begin the discussion?
