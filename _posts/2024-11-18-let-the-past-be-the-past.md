Today, while I was working away, (not on the code I shared in my other post, but *at* work), I suddenly fell into this kind of melancholy. I've dated a lot of people. Thirty-some-odd people. But I also, kind of, in my brain sauce, circle back to the one woman with whom I thought would last. None of them last. But her and I were *different*. We were different, and then we were over.

Inevitably, she broke up with me for some dude at Starbucks, and I was angry, and then I was sad, and then I forgot about her for a while when I initially started my transition. Sometimes I wonder if that breakup is what triggered it. I'm not transitioning now, and I don't know if I'll ever return to it, but that's a whole story. I enjoy navigating my life being confused about gender, and just being forward-facing however I feel like being. But I heard from her once or twice over the years. Over the course of the last fourteen years. And I don't know *why* I still think about her.

There are so many other ex girlfriends I could think about. I could think about the one I was with long-distance for a year, who disappeared overnight while I was sleeping, only to come back in Discord messages three years later to apologize.

I could think about the one whose rent I paid and drove to New York, who inevitably broke it off with me to get back with her estranged husband.

I could think about the two women I dated in separate states, who used me for their own gain in different ways, and then tossed me aside like a broken toy.

Hell, I could even think about my highschool girlfriend, who somehow remains a part of my life, in some tiny, almost insignificant way.

But no.

My head always circles back to *the one*.

And I don't even know what it is about her anymore. I don't think it's important. I don't think I even exist to her in 2024, and rightfully so. *Why would I?*

But it makes me feel like, or wonder, if one of the reasons I have such a hard time, in my near forties, getting *close* to anyone, is because I *refuse* to let go of the past. Most of the time all of my thoughts are living in the nineties, or the early 2000s, and I think of myself as I was then, rather than how I am and who I am, *now*. Everything is me trying to escape what I currently *am*, and it's a wonder that even *with* more matches than I can shake a stick at on dating apps, *I talk to no one*.

The present is crumbling all around us, and simultaneously, I've never been in a better position in my *entire life*.

And I'm still working on myself, on all of these things, and I'm getting *better and better* by the day, *at everything*.

So then why can't I let go of the past? Why can't I ever shake this person, the starbucks-betrayer, out of my head, *once and for all*.

I don't know. Maybe this public journal post will derive some kind of enlightenment ... ten years into the future when I'm hopefully married and not sitting alone in front of a computer like I always am.
