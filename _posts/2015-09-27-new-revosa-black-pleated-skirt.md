Today I've released the very first skirt in the REVOSA clothing line! This particular skirt is black-ish, comes in five the the typical sizes (which were tested on very classic shapes, Maitreya and TMP) and of course, includes an alpha.<br />
<br />
Also worn in the photo is my other recent release, the REVOSA Middle Fingers Tank Top, which is a favorite among most of the clothing I've made so far!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for more clothing, maybe a dress? We'll see!<br />
