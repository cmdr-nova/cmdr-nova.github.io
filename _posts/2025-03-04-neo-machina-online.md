It's been quite a while since my city in Second Life has been online, or even *seen* any light of day. For the most part, it's been inactive in Linden Lab's backup servers for well over six months, maybe longer? I have a hard time keeping up with ... time. Never-the-less, it's back. Due to offline circumstances, and having a little bit more money from my job, I've decided it's totally feasible to have my own *thing* in Second Life running, again. A place where I simultaneously host my store.

Returning with Neo Machina, is as follows: The Outpost Nightclub, the public swimming pool, the lasertag arena, the apartment highrise, the rentable shops around town, the arcade, the back-alley cafe, the nanite systems charging garage, and, of course, my personal main-store.

Currently, I'm working on remodeling the highrise apartments in a way that makes more sense for those who rent, for a 50 land impact size. Previously, I had been allowing a *large* amount of space, and it made no sense at all if you had to confine yourself to a smaller amount of prims.

That'll no longer be an issue.

But, if you're in Second Life, you should definitely come on down and see the re-opening of <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Neo%20Machina/87/116/23" target="_blank">Neo Machina</a>!
