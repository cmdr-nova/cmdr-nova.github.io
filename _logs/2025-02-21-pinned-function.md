I've put together a way, utilizing Liquid and some CSS, to pin a Post, Note, or Log to the top of the feed here on the site. It's still a little wonky though, because, currently, in order to unpin something, I have to manually *go to the post*, and then delete the "pinned: true" function.

Otherwise, it works!
