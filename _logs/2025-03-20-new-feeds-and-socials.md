Almost forgot to write up a changelog for the site, but! Since I've moved my ActivityPub ... erm, activity, *back* to my account on labyrinth.zone, I used some Ruby to pull from the RSS of said account, and created a new main feed here on the homepage. Not only that, but I retrieved my archive from a certain instance that I no longer have full access to, and imported them to my website, immortalized forever.

Other changes:

- -the navigation menu is back behind a vanishing sidebar (to keep things consistent)
- -all posts from social media accounts that are uploading here on an interval are now under a menu via the sidebar called "The Archives"

And that's it!
