Did some updates to the site this evening.

- 1: Removed the feed that shows random posts from my Tumblr, since it looks janky anyway, and replaced it with a feed that shows random photo posts from my own personally specified Reddit and Lemmy communities.
- 2: Added a graphic of a hand spinning that does something neato when you click it.
