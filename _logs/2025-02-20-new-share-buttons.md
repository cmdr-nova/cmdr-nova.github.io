Added new functionality to the site where notes and logs can be shared by clicking the "share" text at the bottom of each element on the site, where a script automatically copies its corresponding link to your clipboard (and notifies you it's done this with a 2 second popup at the bottom of the page), and then also added this same functionality to post content next to the already existing share buttons!
