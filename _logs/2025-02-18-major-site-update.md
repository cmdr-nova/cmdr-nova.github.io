Today the site has been updated in a major way. So, here's a list of things I've done:

* -Used liquid code from <a href="https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks" target="_blank">@shellsharks</a> in order to implement more than just blog posts onto the site! Now includes short-form, social media-esque type posts, and these change logs.

* -Redesigned the front of the website to look like a pretend social media profile!

* -Changed the standalone "/notes" page to display **only** notes, sans logs and posts.

While I'm still looking for a way to list each type of content (posts, notes, and logs) on their own pages, or somehow separately from each other, *everything else is done, for now*. I'm gonna go try out that game Kingdom Delivery pizza.
