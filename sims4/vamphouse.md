[I will be updating and revising this as I see fit, but as of right now this challenge is fully written and ready to be played]

<b>#VampHouseChallenge</b>

I decided I wanted to recreate the conditions that made up my original game, and in order to make sure I did, I created a challenge out of it. I wanted to do this because my original game was really cool, and ridiculous, and I also messed up that save with the amount of modding and MCCC altering I did.

But, as luck would have it, this can be played as a challenge!

(Some of this challenge borrows from the Legacy Challenge, and because of that, you should check out <a href="https://simslegacychallenge.com/the-sims-4-legacy-challenge-rules/" target="_blank">that challenge as well</a>)

[Challenge depends heavily on the Vampire gamepack, and many of the optional goals use most of the expansions and gamepacks as a basis]

<b>To start:</b>

Make your main sim in CAS (or choose one from the gallery, feel free to use #VampHouseChallenge as a tag to share with others), choose any traits and any aspiration you please (must be human), move them into the Bargain Bend (the main sim and any subsequent children must always live in the house on the Bargain Bend) and use cheats to reduce yourself to 1800 simoleans (or be extreme and reduce yourself to 0). You can start in any season, you can look for treasure to sell and I would highly suggest painting to supplement your money. If you’re a klepto you can steal things from other sims to sell as well!

[Money cheats are as follows: testingcheats true, then type in money 1800]

Basically, anything that you can do in the game to make money is fair, except by moving sims into your home (the free 20,000, for this challenge, is going to be considered a cheat, because that’s just way too easy).

You can ask other sims for loans, but those loans must be ‘paid back’ by keeping note of how much you’ve borrowed, and (this is the only time you can do this), you must replace one of your lot traits with ‘celebrity home’ until said loans are paid back. This will effectively make taking out loans a tad bit of a hindrance on your sims.

You may use any lot traits you please for your main sim’s legacy household, but they may never be changed outside of the guidelines spoken about above.

[No cheats or mods that give you an advantage]

Pick a career at random <a href="https://spinthewheel.app/future-sims-4-career-wheel" target="_blank">using this roller</a> (don’t worry about the other stuff)

Make sure you plop down the essentials on your lot, and then go back to manage worlds.

<b>Load up CAS a second time:</b>

Here you will make a vampire sim (or download one from the gallery) who will eventually end up the spouse of your main sim, and this vampire will live at the end of the street down from the Bargain Bend. Be sure to also make a sibling who will live in this house alongside your future vampire spouse.

[If you search #VampHouseChallenge on the gallery you’ll find my latest incarnation of Morgan Karga, the vampire sim, and her alternate male variation, Donovan Karga. You may also use either of these for siblings]

These sims can have a starter house no more than 20k in worth, and once they’re situated go back to manage worlds and return to your main sim.
The reason your main sim starts with nothing, and the vampire sim begins with a starter home, is mostly because if you did this challenge by playing both sims at 1800 simoleans and no home, you likely would not have enough resources and time to finish anything at all.

<b>Getting gone:</b>

[The game can be set to normal or long lifespan (only active household for played sims, if you want), but cannot be perpetually frozen in-time]

Your main sim may not meet or interact with the vampire sim until you’ve got 20,000 simoleans to spare (as in, 20k in your household wallet), and, here’s where the fun begins … (5 points for reaching the 20k goal)

You must woo and marry a random sim in the world. Either have, or adopt a child (must be an infant or a toddler).

[Cannot move-in and marry first spouse until your house can accommodate two people and one child]

[Traits for children must be rolled randomly <a href="https://simslegacychallenge.com/sims-4-legacy-challenge-random-trait-generator/" target="_blank">using the Legacy Challenge roller</a>]

Play your household like you would any other family household. Raise your baby to childhood, be a good spouse, adopt a pet if you please, rise in your career, and with your child at halfway to teen (with 20k simoleans to spare), you may meet and befriend the vampire only. No romantic interaction as of yet.

<b>Playing the vampire:</b>

In order to begin romance with the vampire, they must have a career (using the same random roller) and 20,000 simoleans to spare (again, you can use any non-cheat/non-mod method to make this money, alongside just having a career, and you gain another 5 points for reaching this goal), and (assuming the main household goals are met), you must move the vampire into your own household (this means playing rotationally, so I would personally be using ‘only active household’ for aging).

You cannot marry the vampire until your first spouse absolutely hates you and you’ve divorced. This means that your first spouse must catch you in the act multiple times, over and over again!

Your household must also be able to accommodate five children. Because that’s the amount you’re going to have (it is fine to work towards this as you build up your family)

Once you’ve divorced your first spouse, feel free to move them wherever you please (in the original VampHouse game, the first spouse moved across the street). Now give yourself 20 points for making it this far.

<b>Starting the real game:</b>

Now it’s time to marry the vampire sim you’ve meticulously leveled in a career and moved into your home. Setup the event! And be sure to invite your vampire spouses’ sibling …

Once the wedding ceremony is underway, the sibling of your new spouse must die, on the property where the wedding ceremony is taking place, before the end of the event.

[If the death fails, it’s game over, go back to the start! This is the only condition that causes a hard-restart, but of course, if you’ve somehow failed anything before this point, you’ll also be restarting]

Return to your new life, now married to a vampire, with an estranged child roaming the house.

At your own pace, have or adopt up to 4 more children and raise them while you work on clearing both adult’s aspirations. Also, within this period, the vampire must reach master vampire and then you absolutely have to turn your main sim into a vampire before they reach elder stage (this can be quite challenging due to how long it will take you to get to this point, depending on your playstyle and how quickly you move).

Once the aforementioned goals are complete, one of these sims must take the Vampire Family aspiration and the other must take the Mansion Baron aspiration.

As your children age up to young adult, you can keep them in your house, or move them out, it’s up to you! But you can’t have anymore children, yet.

<b>Optional Goals</b>

Tally up one point per optional goal as you work your way to clearing both aspirations.

    • Paint portraits of each child once they’ve reached young adulthood

    • Make sure both of your sims, who are now the founders of the household, have reached the top of the vampire tiers.

    • Your sim and your spouse should create a club in order to oust Vlad as the vampire ‘leader’, populated with whichever vampires you choose (most likely the vampire family you’re building by turning other sims)

    • Kill a random sim in your basement once per week, and be sure to paint a portrait of their face for the walls in your death basement (if you don’t have a death basement, build one). This is worth 1 point per sim killed

    • Nancy and Geoffrey Landgraab die in your basement

    • Vlad made human via drinking a vampire reversal cocktail (invite him to your household in order to be able to have him drink this)

    • Vlad killed in your death basement, preferably used as a blood-bag

    • Use the pizza delivery person as a blood-bag in your basement at least once (whether they perish is up to you)

    • Accidentally neglect your firstborn child and move them to San Myshuno with a random stranger, and then never play them again.

    • Buy a restaurant where you only sell vampire related food items and poisonous nigiri and call it True Blood

    • Turn at least one of your children into a vampire

    • Do not allow any vampires in your household or under your wing to die by sunlight

    • Choose new careers (your choice, this time) for your sims once they’ve reached the top (which they likely already have).

    • Go on at least one vacation, either camping, or exploring the jungle, and accidentally set one of your offspring on fire

    • Build a bar in your house and use this as a gathering room for your vampire family/club

    • Train each vampire in your club to the top of the vamp tiers

    • Become a global celebrity while being hated by your neighborhood for indiscriminately drinking random townie blood every single day

    • Terrorize the city at night with emotion bursts (works well in nightclubs) and have at least two random sims die from this

    • Build a graveyard in the park and drop the graves of everyone you’ve killed there (if you run out of room, feel free to build a graveyard elsewhere)

    • Solve the the Strangerville mystery

    • Get a star for both vampires on Starlight Boulevard

    • Never have your power cutoff, for a total of 30 points if this never happens

Once you’ve completed both aspirations, it’s time to go deeper.

[With a little bit of inspiration from Buzzfeed multiplayer, this beginning section of the challenge encompasses absolutely everything that happened in my original game (minus the added newer expansion goals that didn’t exist in 2016) and everything after this line is added for longer gameplay and continuity]

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations, give yourself 50 points, plus however many points you’ve earned from the optional goals. This is where we borrow a little bit more from the Legacy Challenge, except it’s a bit different. Since both founder sims, your main sim and vampire spouse, are undead, they haven’t and don’t suffer the effects of aging, but they can’t hold down the same household forever, can they?
Advancing through generations:

Now it’s time for someone to take over the family. Have or adopt a sixth child, depending on gender, this will be the gender that your successors must be for the remaining 9 generations. Be sure that this child’s traits and aspirations are randomly chosen.

Use the roller from the beginning of the challenge to pick new careers and aspirations for your first-gen vampires to work through until your new child becomes a young adult. If the random roller picks something you’ve already had, roll again.

Once this successor is a young adult, they must drink a vampire reversal cocktail, revolving around the idea that they’re unhappy with the vampire life and yearn to be human.

Go to ‘manage worlds’ and move the first-gen vampires into a ‘retirement home’ in a completely different world (any world you choose). From this point forward they will no longer be played, and if you’ve completed their new careers and aspirations by this point, give yourself 20 points (it is not a game failure if you don’t complete these things, but you don’t get the points).

Use the random career roller to pick a career for your 2nd gen successor, and begin!

<b>The Vampire Hunters:</b>
i.e., culling the vampire population

The spouse each successor has can be created in CAS (must be human, alien, or mermaid, but not a vampire), downloaded from the gallery (remember to use #VampHouseChallenge to share your sims) or chosen from within the game world (but you may not utilize their free 20k upon move-in, meaning, if you move in a sim and they add 20k to your household wallet, use the money cheat to take yourself back down to the original amount you had beforehand).

Your successor’s spouse may have a career if you like, but this career must also be chosen at random.

Per generation, it’s 10 points per original career/aspiration completed, so, if your successor completes their career and aspiration, it’s a total of 10 points. If both the successor and their spouse complete their career/aspiration (if you’ve chosen to give your sim’s spouse a career), it’s 20 points. If the spouse doesn’t have a career, but you’ve completed the successor’s career/aspiration and the spouse’s aspiration, it’s 15 points.

[If you’re using MCCC for story progression, make sure spouses don’t overwrite the family name]

You will repeat this process for up to 9 generations, completing their aspirations and careers before they become elders and pass-on. For each generation you advance through, it’s another 10 points, for a total of 90.

If you fail and do not reach the 10th generation of the VampHouse, game over. Go back to the start!

Remember that each successor must be the same gender as the successor who took over for the first-gen vamps.
Optional goals to complete as you make your way to gen-10:

Tally up one point per optional goal

    • Take a vacation at least once per generation (one point per single vacation taken per generation, no additional points if a second vacation is taken in the same generation. So this would be 9 points total)

    • Make a club with the goal of reforming vampires and bringing them back to humanity (one point per vampire reformed) [the first-gen vampires are exempt from this]

    • Continue the legacy of the Death Basement, and if you run out of room for victim paintings, build a secondary basement! (again, one point per sim who dies in your basement)

    • Bonus two points per sim if the sim trapped in your basement is a vampire (the most effective way to kill a vampire is by utilizing an enclosed room with direct sunlight pouring in)

    • Visit the first-gen vampires at least once

    • Throw a successful gold event at your home once per generation, for a total of 9 points

    • Continue the legacy of the True Blood restaurant, mixing up menu items as you please and removing the discriminatory vampire-only food based items

    • Open up a retail business for selling vampire reversal cocktails (you should have a vampire somewhere who will be able to craft these, but do not play your first-gen vamps)

    • Fill your legacy home with garlic in order to ward off any and all vampires from breaking-in

    • Go bowling at least once

    • Utilize Sacrificial’s ‘extreme violence’ mod to make culling vampires easier (not required, as this mod has CC that can mess with your game a bit, and the animations aren’t exactly top-notch)

    • Get a star for each successor on Starlight Boulevard, for a total of 5 points per star

    • Never have your power cutoff, for a total of 30 points if this never happens

<b>Reaching the 10th generation:</b>

Congratulations, I can’t believe you’ve made it this far. At this point you could potentially have a baseline total of 482 points, plus whichever added optional goals you’ve completed that add more points depending on how many times you complete it (such as murdering random sims in your basement at one point each, once per week).

[If my math here is incorrect, please feel free to let me know!]

<b>Full Circle:</b>

Now that you’ve reached the 10th generation, it’s time to get back to your roots, completely spurning the idea that vampirism is bad. Seek out your vampiric ancestors from generation one and plead that they give you the gift of unlife.

Find one of your siblings, turn them into a vampire (as your rise through the ranks), and move them into the end of bargain bend where the original vampire sim once lived. (10 points if you’re able to complete this)

With a random career and aspiration chosen, and your new vampirism attained, find a spouse (spouse must remain human), have at least three children, rise to Grand Master vampire and complete careers and aspirations for your 10th gen before your first child reaches the young adult stage.

If all of this is completed successfully, give yourself 15 points, 20 points if your sim’s spouse had a career and reached the 10th level.

Give yourself 10 points if you’ve reached Grand Master vampirism.

Give yourself 1 point per child raised before the first-born is young adult, with a maximum of 6 potential points, as long as they made it into their teens.

Once all of this is completed, move the 10th gen vampire in with their sibling at the end of the road …(and move the children you had into their own home somewhere else in the worlds)

And start again from the beginning with a brand new sim on the Bargain Bend plot, or call it a day! You’ve completed the entire #VampHouseChallenge.

By this point you could have earned a baseline total of 528 points, not counting the optional goals that increase per amount of times completed.

Sit back, reflect on your journey, and remember the good times you had, the people who died and the friends you’ve made.

It’s been a long road ...
