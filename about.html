    <p>Hey there! I'm Commander Nova, prolific creator behind a million different things. Over the years I've done much, and I've created this page to showcase and connect to absolutely all of it.</p>
    
    <p>Previously, I had a website dedicated to just Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and then a website dedicated to just my Second Life stuff. But, as a multifaceted content creator, it sort of kneecaps you a little bit to have everything in separate little spaces that you have to individually check and update. So, enter: CMDR Nova, the WEBSITE!
    </p>
    
    <p>
    That aside, here's a little bit about me ...
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I was born in 1985, and had my first interaction with entertainment through the original, the one and only, the Nintendo Entertainment System. A lot of people's first games nowadays are all manner of things, but mine was Super Mario Brothers. And yeah, I really enjoyed the 90s adaption into some kind of grimdark realist take on the world of Mario and Luigi.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    My first interactions with computing were on a 2 or 386, and some very early version of DOS. That was back in like 1991 when my Dad was posting to a BBS by physically dialing into them. I remember a text adventure Twilight Zone game I'd play sometimes. Was terrifying for me at the age of 6 or 7.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Eventually, the family got a Gateway PC. This thing was a few steps up, some kind of 486. I remember Windows 95 demo disks, the screeching dial tones of dialup internet. Chat rooms, primitive forums, Geocities, and Worlds Chat. This was all leaps and bounds different than what we have today, and in some ways, I miss it dearly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It is these experiences, actually, that brought me to Neocities (if you're reading this from my github mirror page, either Neocities no longer exists, or you've accidentally navigated to the backup).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As the 90s marched forward, there was the Playstation, the Nintendo 64, and then, eventually my very own PC. I think around that time is when I started to learn how to write HTML in notepad. But it was quite a lot different back then in the early days when the World Trade Center was still ... uh, there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As I drew closer and closer to the end of high school, I took up an interest in another now defunct website, animeboards.com. I feel like that place was my real first taste of what social media would eventually become, because, at the time, I'm not even sure I had Myspace.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But why am I telling you all of this? Because, at some point, or some time, the way the internet exists today will collapse. The people will take it back, and those of us who remember the ways it used to kick a ton of ass are gonna be like, "Radical dude."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Everything that happens after that is history, though. I started writing, I started a store in Second Life, I started making music, and then suddenly it was 2024, and here I am writing this.
