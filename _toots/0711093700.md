shitty trans politics on the timelineI almost responded to someone on here trying to marginalize trans men and women for the way they express their feelings about being misgendered (because the way they do so is exclusionary to nonbinary people?) but as someone who was transitioning and is now just confused, and can't do much thanks to the way the world is, there are way more important things to concentrate on rather than analyzing how trans women talk about their feelings and complaining about those feelings not including space for YOU
