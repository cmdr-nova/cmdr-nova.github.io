among the many reasons I'm not too bothered by tiktok going away, is that the corporation also has their own AI scraper running around the web that you absolutely have to add to your AI blocklistsmall businesses having to relocate sucks, but also sludge-fluencers, rampant misinformation by _american users_ (not the chinese), and the softening of the impact of AI, or, convincing the general joe and the average jane that it's fine and coolyeah, I'm not too bothered
