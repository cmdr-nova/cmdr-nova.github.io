Apt Install Blog_PostI've avoided writing anything for a bit, maybe a week or so, or more? I lose count of days sometimes. I haven't really written much for my book, and I've made drafts on here but haven't published. I think it's mostly to do with my writing-brain needing constant breaks. But that's beside the point, because recently I made the full-switch away from Windows 11 straight to Debian 12.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/16/apt-install-blog_post/
