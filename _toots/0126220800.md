it WOULD be wild if we were the aliens on Earth the whole time. It would kind of make sense, since oxygen is slowly killing us, but also how we're able to breathe, and how a lot of things on this planet are hostile to humanityThere is of course the scientific theory that we crawled out of some goop and became a fish with legs and so on and so forth, but what if that goop WAS seeded by a spacecraft crash landing upon this rockYou look at yourself in the mirror and you don't particularly see an extraterrestrial, but that's exactly what an alien would think
