I decided to get some [#KingdomCome2](https://mastodon.online/tags/KingdomCome2) in before I try and get some day-sleep in, and I almost regret taking this Lute quest now lol

I had to steal a lute, ended up killing a guy to steal his. Then I gave the guys the lute they wanted, then the strings broke. Got told to gut some sheep for string. Found a whole field of sheep, killed one. Turns out that lamb belong to a guy, he came after me.

I killed him and dumped his body inside of his own home, and then ran away
