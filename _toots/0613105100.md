for the longest time I couldn't really look back at Mists of Panderia, cause I dated someone for about a year who lived long distance from me, and we played WoW together everyday, during the MoP days hahaThankfully it's been like 7 years since, so it doesn't matter anymore, but maybe I can enjoy it again
