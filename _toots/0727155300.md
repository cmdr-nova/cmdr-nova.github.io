"Michael C. Hall stepped into Variety's video studio at San Diego Comic-Con 2024 yesterday to discuss the upcoming prequel Dexter: Original Sin and the surprising sequel Dexter: Resurrection."We just felt like there was more to explore. I think we've all been really amazed at how fertile the soil of 'Dexter' remains," Hall shared."Yeah, you don't say?You know, maybe like having Dexter's previous team at Miami Metro finally find out that he's the BHB and then seemingly KILL him at the end of New Blood?Yeah, yeah I'm glad they decided that was a piss poor ending lol
