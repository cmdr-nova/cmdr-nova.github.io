It's not a great feeling to have to explain to people why, despite how much you like ActivityPub and Mastodon, it kinda sucks and feels like crap to have to abandon _literally everything else_, because it's all turned fascist, as an artist, a dev, and a writer.Like, before it was like "I get some support from Mastodon, and it's a cool site where I can really say what I want", but now it's "I have to be here because everything else is bad, and this is where everything I do has to be no matter what, because it's the only option left"
