I don't know if anyone was hoping I'd release my next album for real by the 1st of next month, but I'm so caught up in the 80 billion things I'm doing including my job, that I'm not close to that and the release date is gonna have to be pushedOptimally I want it to release on Halloween, but Bandcamp won't let me set a date that far out lol
