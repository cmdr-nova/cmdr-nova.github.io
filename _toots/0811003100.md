I tried to give Nostr some more chances, and I think they have at least _something_ going for them, but now they're talking about having relays delete posts over 90 days old, which, functionally, basically makes the whole network no different than a Mastodon instance with no cloud media storage (so you may as well just be on Mastodon)
