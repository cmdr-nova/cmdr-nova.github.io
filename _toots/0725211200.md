a long while ago someone suggested I put image descriptions on my wordpress when I have images in my postsI decided to start doing thisThen I got rid of the wordpress site and exported a backup of all my posts, and now I'm manually inserting them into my Jekyll siteand because the images in the original hosted destination don't exist, I kind of have to guess what image they were in order to put them backexcept I don't have to guess! i have the image descriptions! haha
