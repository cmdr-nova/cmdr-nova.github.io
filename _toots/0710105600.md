I'm sure I'm not the only person in the world who beat Inquisition, and watched the ending cinematic where your Inquisitor and the rest of your party plotted on a map where to find Solas, and set off to pursue himNow to have that completely forgotten about by a studio that wants you to, I guess, forget this happened.
