I said on Threads that it had completely escaped me that there are no ads on Threads because that's the default experience on Mastodon, the client I use the mostAnd this guy's like "but you pay for your mastodon account don't you"See, this is the kind of absent-minded confusion that lurks out there about MastodonThe general populace doesn't even know anymore what it means to host a server and pay hosting fees
