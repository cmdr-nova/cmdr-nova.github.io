Come in at 7am and boss informs me that all supervisors (me, and others) will not leave the building until all freight from the night shift is worked, and this will continue over the next weekI’m desperately trying to figure out if it’s illegal to hold hourly associates against their will beyond an 8 hour period because I am still sick and I can’t fuggin do this shit
