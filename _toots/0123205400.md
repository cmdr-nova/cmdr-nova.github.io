Been taking a mind-break since I got sick and am mostly better. Not sure why that involved getting back into Ubisoft games I haven't played in forever, but Breakpoint is a very decent military open world thing, and it's also strange they said "no more updates"Just the same way it's strange they did that to Watchdogs Legion, which is also really cool.But The Division 2 is the one still getting updates, and an expansion this year lol
