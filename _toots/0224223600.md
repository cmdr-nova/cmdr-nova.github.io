be in #secondlife going to a sim with my SL g/f, it's a david lynch party, and the owner DMs me seconds after I get there asking me to detach my robot stuff hahaI hate when people do that thing where they're like"Hey, welcome! Nice to see you!"and then do a 180, "Anyway, can you do this thing right now? It's the rules"haha no binch
