Listening to a video about System of a Down and how they basically just stopped almost everything after making probably one of the best albums of all timeYou know, back in the era of 2005 when rock and metal was still covered extensively by media outlets instead of what we have now, which is just nothing but pop and more pop They should come back, Korn should take a break, and SOAD should return lol
