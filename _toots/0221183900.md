i stil have the media bucket on digital ocean from my debian install of mastodon (which isn't there at the moment)not sure if there's any good reason to keep it aside from keeping the naming scheme in the event I need to relaunch my instance in that wayaltho if I do have to do that you bet your ass I'm getting a backup of this one lol
