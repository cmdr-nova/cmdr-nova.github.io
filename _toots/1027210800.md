One of the things that inspired me to keep writing on my website even if nobody ever comments, is because this one time, someone messaged me on Reddit a year after I thought I completely lost my How-to-Second Life guide (after shutting down the VPS it was hosted on), and asked me where it was.They said they liked to reference it and use it for their friends trying out SL, and it made me realize that, even if people don't comment on anything, or *say* anything, they're likely there, regardlessSo, of course I put that guide back onto my new website with the help of the internet archive
