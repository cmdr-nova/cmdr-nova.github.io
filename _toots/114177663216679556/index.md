updated the styling for different sources of content on my site's main homepage

i used the coloring source in the mastodon branding guide, but those are definitely not the colors of the current mastodon client

for bluesky, i just looked at their css in the source file, and the automated one on tumblr is using the 2014 era "tumblr blue"
