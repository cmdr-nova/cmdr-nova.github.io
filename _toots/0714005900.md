I’ve been giving Nostr a fair shake and the features it boasts are endless, and I like how users can shoot money at each other for fun, and your account can basically go anywhere, but I think the biggest thing I don’t like is that your public account key can be used to extract all of your data minus private messagesIt’s basically the logical end point of decentralization but with almost no user privacy, and that’s what has me feeling iffy about it
