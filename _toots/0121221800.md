I just wanted to save these Tim Sweeney tweets talking about "linux users are cheaters" before I never look at Twitter againAnd the one commentator is correct. All these companies like Respawn, Epic, will outright forsake linux because of cheaters, while ignoring they've already got cheaters coming from WINDOWS
