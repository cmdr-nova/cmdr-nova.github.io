but this does clarify to me that a lot of people may just not be here because they find it harder to make money from peoplewhichi mean, in the past decade I've made more money and support from the fediverse than I have anywhere else, and I think that's just because I've stayed here and stuck with it (no matter how many times I got banned by overzealous admins)
