reddit keeps putting "linuxsucks" on my home timeline and i don't know if these people are serious, or shitposting, but one of the arguments i keep seeing is "linux is for people who don't value their time"Debian 12 took me less time to install, setup, download essentials, open all of my daily apps, and started downloading games faster than Windows 10/11 installed and got me to the "Welcome" screen
