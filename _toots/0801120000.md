People are talking about wanting a function for shared instance blocklists, which I think would be a great idea, a great way to have a collaborative effort to silence nazi and pdf instancesThe problem, though, is how do you stop people from peopling and turning it into “I’m going to make sure every instance with this list is blocking this person I don’t like personally”Because that’s what happened with Twitter’s blockbot, and that’s what people use public mute lists for (partially) on bluesky Basically, how do you stop people from abusing other people and only block actual bad instances. This is the one issue with community moderation
