I think it would be neat if I could offer to people a service where I build them a blog in a github repo, and then be like "alright, now fork it, and set it up in your github pages, and you're done"but my social reach has diminished by like 200% since I left twitter and I can't even get anyone to buy my custom link pages ðŸ˜‚
