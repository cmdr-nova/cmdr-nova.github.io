I think I"m understanding how Kane Pixels made all this Backrooms content look so realIt's a lot of Blender, a lot of 3D rendering, with SOME actual people, but every bit of it is downscaled to very low rez, but also at 60 FPS (or more)so it looks incredibly real, like something recorded in the 80sbut it's mostly fake, and you can't really tell
