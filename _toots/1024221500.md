Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsCall of Duty, On Linux?!https://nova.mkultra.monster/linux/2024/10/25/call-of-duty-on-linux.htmlAs some may know, I play Call of Duty sometimes. One of the reasons I briefly switched back to Windows, is because I wanted to do so, and couldn’t on Pop!_OS, despite having purchased pretty much every version of CoD since the original Black Ops 2. But, I ultimately decided that being able to play CoD wasn’t worth the trade-off of … using Windows. That was, until I realized I could play Modern Warfare III, and, presumably, Black Ops 6, on GeForce now. There is … an issue, though.
