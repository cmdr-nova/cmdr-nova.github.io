I'm not trying to sound like a contrarian with like everything I post. A lot of what I say comes from political exhaustion since 2016But is anyone else tired of these posts that are like "you should be more worried/speaking about this"Like things that obviously, most of us are worried about, probably thinking about, or talking aboutAnd like, things that almost none of us have any power to change or affect. It's the same song and dance since mid-2016 and I don't know how people are still marching these tactics out like it's something new
