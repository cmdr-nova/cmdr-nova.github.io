I kind of want to replace the streaming radio player on my website with a player that plays a random track I've made in my entire discography, but I absolutely cannot use my limited space on my website to upload everything I've ever made (I have 50 gigs on Neocities, but it's pushed through Github, which "recommends" not exceeding 1 gig)I don't think Spotify is a solution, and I don't know if I'd want to support their service by making API calls to itBandcamp seems almost doable, but you have to periodically refresh your API tokensif only there was some other way lol
