I wanted to see if Dragon Age: Origins works on Debian/Gnome and, it does! So I started a new game just for fun, as a mage, of course (I'm always a mage)Completely forgot about having to either help Jowan, or rat him outBut it really makes me want to see the Warden return in Veilguard even tho I seriously doubt that happens (but would be a cool surprise)
