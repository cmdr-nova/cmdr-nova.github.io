Nsfw, sexuality, threadsI think everyone has a right to have their own space where they can be or express sexual desire, as long as it’s a way that doesn’t constitute sexually harassing anyoneBut I look at Threads and I see some dudes posting like “if you see this you gotta show me your titties” or “if you’re serving cunt it better come on a platter” and IT REALLY RUBS ME THE WRONG WAYlol
