I didn't know Digg was still a website, or that people even used it for anything. Looking back, I think it originated as an alternative Reddit, but never really got there.That aside, this "how long would it take to bruteforce your password" article is interesting, but don't most systems lock you out completely after 3 failed attempts? https://digg.com/tech/link/how-long-hack-crack-password-hive-systems-2024
