anyway, I keep feeling like I have tomorrow off, but I actually have two more days of work lolit's okay though I guess, they gave me the position I wanted a couple months ago, but now I'm just anxious about _that_and, despite the position I wanted, I kind of still actually just want to get out of retail .....
