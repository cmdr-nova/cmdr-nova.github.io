I keep romanticizing those years I spent isolated and only making music and stuff in Second Life as like, something much better than where I am now, just because I could sleep as long as I needed and make my own rulesBut then I gotta keep reminding myself I had virtually no money, no car, no phone, and living like that led me to the worst panic attack in my lifeBut damn I do miss waking up whenever I feel like it
