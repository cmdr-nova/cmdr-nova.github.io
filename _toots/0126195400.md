Only just now finding out that the whole controversy of Ubisoft deleting your account if you don't use it for 4 years only applies to accounts with no games on them or with free to play games only lolI mean, I guess that would still suck, though, right? Like what if someone only plays their F2P titles but they've bought things in them?
