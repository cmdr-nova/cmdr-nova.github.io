I'm not going to share the photos of what or who people think the Adjuster is (I'm not going to help cops do their jobs), but tons and tons and tons of people not readily or immediately going "Hey, these are different people in every single one of these photos" really makes a case as to why so many struggle with knowing when something is generative slop
