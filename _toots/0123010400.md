so the cleaning I did on this instance earlier, I was able to watch full logs of it as it happenedand it looks like there's a connection error when the cleanup tasks try to delete orphan media attachments, i'm assuming, because they're in a spaces bucket at digital oceannot sure how to fix that, altho I can just go to the droplet on digital ocean and delete _everything_ in the media foldernot sure if I should do that tho
