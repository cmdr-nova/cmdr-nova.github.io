my instance is maintaining 35-40 gigs of media storage, with daily cleanup, out of the 200 or so gigs my storage bucket allows without extra chargesthat's with 3 relays turned on, and a bot on my instance that's constantly posting images it's taken from lemmy and redditcould still do better to scale it more efficiently, but i think this is sustainable
