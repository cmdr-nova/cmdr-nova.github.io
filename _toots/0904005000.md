looking at mastodon's css, I must be writing css the old waylike why do we need to specify all the colors in the root, i mean i get that it's a cool way to mix things together and generate matching colors, but dangjust when i thought i really grasped how to write a kind of code, it changes (i might be years out of date on this, who knows)
