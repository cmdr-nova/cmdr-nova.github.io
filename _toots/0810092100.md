Some people blow my mind lolLuke got an M1 MacBook off eBay for like 150 bucks that was listed as "for parts"Turns out not only was it a brand new 2024 m1 MacBook, but it was still under warrantyPeople throwing out a laptop that cost them anywhere between 700 to 1200 dollars, so Luke can fix it for 300 and have a fully functional laptop lolhttps://youtu.be/fMDbj0cBcFw?si=EmGtS2ZietEawlN2
