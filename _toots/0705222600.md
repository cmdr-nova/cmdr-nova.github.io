So I have a tendency to zone out while I'm driving sometimes, so I pretty much always use a GPS just to make sure I get to where I'm going no matter whatAnd, for whatever reason, I have to pay close attention to the route Siri is taking me on because every ONCE IN A WHILE she takes me a completely different route than normal and I end up in the ass end of nowhere to get to the same destination that would normally be much simpler on another route lolSIRI, DAMMIT
