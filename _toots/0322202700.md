Did a recording of the first mission (uploaded to my diode.zone account cause Masto hates big video files). This is Cyberpunk 2077 running on Pop!_OS (#Linux), 64 gigs of ram, Radeon RX 7600, 10 cores, 16 threads, and of course an SSDYou can see at the upper right the FPS wavering a little bit, but Firefox and 16 tabs open in the background were also there lolhttps://diode.zone/w/rkv7D3V6gxCJSJVgLXgFPt
