Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsI Can’t Recommend Nekoweb, A Neocities Alternativehttps://nova.mkultra.monster/tech/2024/10/15/i-can-t-recommend-nekoweb-a-neocities-alternative.htmlToday I woke up, and, like I do, I checked my “daily report” bot e-mail, and noticed something … strange. According to the Neocities subreddit, the person behind Neocities had written, a year ago, some positive thinking about AI (which, I’m not sure can be fully judged a year later, since it’s only gotten extremely bad, this year). In response, some users were suggesting Nekoweb as an alternative for people who don’t want to be potentially affiliated with someone who endorses Sam Altman. And then I stumbled into an issue, and the strangest people I’ve met this week (so far).
