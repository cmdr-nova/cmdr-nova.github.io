I've setup a notes layout, made a folder on my jekyll site much like the _posts folder, but for _notes, and i have a notebook.html in the rootnow, to figure out how to display the notes on the notebook.html page, and paginate it exactly the same way I paginate blog posts, but without having them be full clicky posts lol
