I don't HATE my current job, but it's not what I want to do with my life, or ... the rest of it, at this pointI took tech classes in school, I've been working with web development, Linux, hardware (I can build a PC) and so on and so forth for the better part of 2 decades (or even more?!) FOR FUNI should be in a TECH job
