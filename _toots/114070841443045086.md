posting to mastodon with RSS is much easier than the method I was using before (having a github workflow log into my VPS via SSH and execute a python script that reads a post, and constructs it with a corresponding url ðŸ˜‚ )

but it's only easy if you force the script to only look at the latest 10 feed items, and to keep track of feed items by cataloging them with id numbers in a text file, and by also comparing today's date with the date of the post, and _only_ posting if all that matches
