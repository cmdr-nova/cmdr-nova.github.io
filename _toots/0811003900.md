Obviously there are people on Bluesky and Threads constantly talking shit about people who use Mastodon, or Mastodon itself, but that's because they get all of their information from hearsay, or they just don't like having to choose a community (which makes no sense, but a lot of people make no sense in 2024, trust me, I work in retail)
