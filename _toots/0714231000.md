I’ve been noticing lately (at least on pop_os) I basically almost never have to restart my PC, but sometimes software I use just won’t open at all, and it requires me to do a restart. This is usually an every other day occurrenceI don’t know if it’s because I usually have tons and tons of stuff open, or if it’s just a symptom of not restarting my PC regularly lol
