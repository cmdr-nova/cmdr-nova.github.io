I go to the store with my SL g/f to look at jewelry, and these people walk in already on their mics and one of them sees a piece of jewelry that says "born in the 80s" and they go "ew who's born in the 80s" lolso I say "I was." and they say something like "you old you need to get out of SL" and then I look at their avatar and it's a child avatar
