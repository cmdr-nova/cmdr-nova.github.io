you know, wrapping my head around the actual horrific backrooms content (like kane parson's work), it kind of makes me think about space, the universe, how most of it is still vastly unknownand i think about this book i've been writing, restarting, rewriting, and frozen on, because I got to this point where the character(s) are stranded in the void, nothing around, no stars, no plants, and I've always been thinking "well, okay now what"but now i'm like ... what do you mean "now what"as if space has rules?
