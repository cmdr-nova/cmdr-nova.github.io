death/dead body talkI didn't know how desensitized to ... well, I guess most things I've become, until the photo of the dead shooter got pushed all over everything and I was forced to see it at least 7 times now and I'm mostly just wondering why tf this is being freely posted, especially in Youtube videosYou can put a dead body on Youtube but not bare boobies?
