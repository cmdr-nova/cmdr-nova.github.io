Basically raced to create a new masto account, uploaded my following csv and then busted out the door to work lol

But, I wanted to move back to Mastodon because I have a script that shares new posts from my RSS feed and I wanted that to share on the account I’m actually using and as far as I can tell Akkoma has no API access
