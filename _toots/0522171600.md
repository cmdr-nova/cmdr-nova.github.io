Listening to Let’s Read and this UK college student rented out a room in this couple’s home, the husband started being creepy, so she told the wife, then later the wife tried to harm her and she goes “I couldn’t believe it, after months I thought we could trust each other”I might be weird but I wouldn’t trust a stranger just cause I’d been in their house for a couple monthsIn fact I wouldn’t even do that lol
