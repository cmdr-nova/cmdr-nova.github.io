Since I'm constantly writing right before midnight, I sometimes accidentally fugg up the timezone syncing, and then my blog posts don't automatically push to Mastodon.So, today, I'll be sharing this one manually.Today on Nova Prime, I write about how and why you should maintain a website, why I do, and how you might stay invested in doing so, far into the future, much like I have and continue to do.https://nova.mkultra.monster/webdev/2025/01/15/to-build-a-website-and-remain-invested.html#webdev #indieweb
