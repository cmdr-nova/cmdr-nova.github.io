I'm not sure I could ever dedicate myself to only using Bluesky, because I've got pieces of Mastodon baked into my website that updates like a billion things dynamically depending on what I'm doing on Mastodon lolI'm sure you could somehow get Bluesky to do the same thing, but it just wouldn't feel the same
