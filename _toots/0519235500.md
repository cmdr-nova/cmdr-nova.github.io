When I talk about the debt I'm in from these vets, I say it's like hundreds a month just siphoned from my accountSo to paint a clearer picture, imagine paying 50-80 dollars a month for something, but doing it 6 times as monthThen have car payments on top of that, that are also sorta astronomicalIT SUCKS BRO
