I feel like I should put a main array on my site that shows my latest post, note, log, toot, and skeet, and then have links on the sidebar that go to a custom paginated page for each type where you can see them all

Probably is, I think Jekyll pagination (at least the version github lets you use) only works with _one_ feed, which is why the current feed is everything from everywhere all at once
