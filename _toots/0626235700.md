One of the reasons I haven’t written anything for my book in half a year, is because I’ve setup this story where the main character is marooned in space, in a universe that is deteriorating and … despite that being really awesome and epic, I don’t know where to go after she gets to that point lol… but then I discovered the concept of liminal dimensions outside our own where extra dimensional beings prey on the psyche of humans who unfortunately end up lost there andI think it’s time to start writing again
