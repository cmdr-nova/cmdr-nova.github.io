I told myself that I wanted to spend a little bit of today trying to find new work, so here we are:I currently work for W**mart, and I should not be in retail. I should not be doing this for the rest of my life!I've been into web development since I was a teenager in the early 2000s. I could write you some HTML and CSS on a piece of paper in a coffee shop. I'm also pretty knowledgeable on JavaScript, and have been screwing around with Python for the past 6 months.All I need is something steady, preferably remote, and for at least around 60k a year. Get back to me.#getfedihired #webdev #webdeveloper
