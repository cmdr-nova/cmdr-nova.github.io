So I post in the GW2 Discord guild-recruitment ads channel like "hey, i'm looking for a guild, here's what I can do, and what I can't"one of the mods comes out of hibernation to scold me, and says I can post that sort of thing in the LFG channel, but guild recruiters don't look in the LFG channel, and you also can't post about looking for a guild on the main GW2 subreddit, but you can use the guild recruitment subredditlolBro, if the recruiters aren't looking at the LFG channel, but they *are* looking at the guild-ads channel, then why would you reddit-mod your way into forcing people to basically leave your server to find a guildFrikken, who puts people like this in charge of things
