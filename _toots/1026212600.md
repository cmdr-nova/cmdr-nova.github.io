I was trying to get the right sidebar on my site to auto align to the right, and keep all the new responsivenes I've made, and failing.I decided "hey, what if i put some stuff in a footer and move it to the bottom?"So I added the additional footer.html document andIt went to the right side of the page, and became responsive to the rest of the content.Entirely because it's separate from the header and the home documents that Jekyll usesHoly farts
