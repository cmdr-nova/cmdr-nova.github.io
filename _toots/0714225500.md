Trying to figure out if I want to keep my sim in Second Life. I still hang out in SL everyday, even if only for an hour, but I don't know if I can ever build a community of people who bustle in and out and create basically the life of the city I built.It's hard for me to think about permanently shutting it down, because I spent months and months building it, and it's my own space. But also, LL charges far too much money for personal serversI just don't know though. If I were to get promoted or find a higher paying job tomorrow it wouldn't matter
