Neo Machina: Not Closed!Hey, what do you know? I changed my mind (previous post has been set to private). Basically, the past ... I guess five months, I've been having a lot of financial anxiety. Everything's expensive, credit cards don't ever seem to be going down. I told myself I was going to close Neo Machina until I pay down a few cards, and then reopen it.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/04/neo-machina-not-closed/
