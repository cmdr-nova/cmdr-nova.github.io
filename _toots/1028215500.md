Like, I'm not trying to be a complete Luddite, even tho it's completely reasonable to be so in 2024, but there are uses I can think of for AI that I'd like to have it forLike intelligent reminders, because I have a bad memory. Intelligent GPS, so Siri stops navigating me through places I've never been before to get to the same destination every single day, because I don't drive without GPS onIntelligent notes that ... uh, do something, I guessBasically, I'm interested up to the point that Siri is usefulBut these companies, or the government, have go to address the issue of polluting the planet with this stuff immediately because Sam Altman doesn't give a shit and I think he belongs in jail regardless of what happens
