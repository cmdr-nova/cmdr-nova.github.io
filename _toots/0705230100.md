So the back and forth between Threads and Mastodon works, but it's very poop right nowA reply from Mastodon takes 5 minutes to reach Threads, and then it shows up as a "click here to view the reply" and the Mastodon reply shows up in a popup boxI hope that's not how they envision integrating the fediverse over there lol
