Drew Gooden makes great content but he keeps mentioning in most of his videos "so I was scrolling Twitter"and every single time my brain sauce is like "WHY are you still on twitter?? why are you talking about it like it's something normal that people still do?"I get stuck in this thought process that youtubers are so busy being youtubers they're oblivious to what's going on around themhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56EyKNjhUDY
