unlessssssss ...but yeah, i copied the code from the person who made this possible. it basically takes an rss of comments from a post that you specify, which works great, and requires minimal fiddling, and I appreciate his work!but for whatever reason, a lot of the css styling wasn't working, or broken, and I absolutely had to change how comments were laid out and also remove the font-awesome icons (because I ain't paying you for icons FA)
