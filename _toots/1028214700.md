You ever look back at the 90s, and how 1990 to 2000 really did feel like a long time. We went from beige plastic boxes called computers that hardly anyone had with screechy modems and barely any mobile phones, to broadband internet, a PC in every home, MP3 players, and mobile phones you could call and text with, and even take video!And then you look at 2010 to 2020 and it seems like it was 5 seconds long, and 2020 to 2030 feels like it's coming fast2000 to 2010 was also a special case, but only because we got supercomputers you can touch with your fingies to put in our pockets
