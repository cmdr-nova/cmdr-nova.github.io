Trying to make a script in Second Life that detects people wearing that garbage "Bloodlust" HUD, but Second Life doesn't really have a whole lot of debuggingWhatever you do, don't ask an AI to look at itMe: there's a syntax error, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrongAI: *guesses*Me: No that's not right, try againAI: *guesses*Me: that's still not correct, try againAI: *guesses again*Me: You know what I'll google it
