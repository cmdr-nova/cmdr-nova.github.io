I'm trying to find a GW2 guild and there are a lot of themLooking through the GW2 Discord, I find ones that have strict times you need to show up for, which I can't do, because I work an unpredictable job. And then other ones that look really cool, but then they're like "Be a regular Discord chatter, be active" and again, I'm a recluse, and I have strange work hours lol why have these rules that sounds like they were made by Reddit moderators with a control-freak complex
