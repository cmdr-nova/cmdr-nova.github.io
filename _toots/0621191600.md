If we had a UBI in the states I would legit probably use it to kill my debt, and then I'd leave my job to pursue the content creator career I'm slowly chipping away at by filling up 97% of my time with just making things I want to make, and sleepingHell I WAS doing that, but in this day and age I'd need 3000 a month to be _okay_
