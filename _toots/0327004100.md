I guess these guys in Helldivers 2 couldn't hear me on mic, maybe I have it setup wrongBut I'm trying to talk to them, and I'm messing with my settings right lol so they ... drop a resupply on top of me and laugh as it squashes meYou know, like you doSo's I come back and murder them both immediately, and then continue on with the mission myself lolThey kicked me
