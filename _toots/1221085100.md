I think it's okay to setup a script that posts links and things you do, or enjoy, to an automated account of your own creation. I mean heck, I do it myself!But when you cross the line of using that bot to, perhaps, jump into the notifications of anyone who's actively posting on the fedi timeline, and especially for your own financial or personal gainyeah, it's gonna be a full ban indefinitely
