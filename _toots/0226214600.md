Prompt: My most ambitious projectDescribe the most ambitious DIY project you've ever taken on. Well, this is quite the prompt. Not because it's a complicated question, but more-so that the answer is the complicated one. I've been a sort of "DIY" person since I graduated high school, even if I didn't really know it at the time. It started with writing HTML for band fan pages on Geocities, and then that evolved into writing a book.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/02/27/prompt-my-most-ambitious-project/
