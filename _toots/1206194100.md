controversial opinions, separating the strong from the weak willedSometimes I share my controversial opinions to make sure I don't have people with weak opinions following me ðŸ˜‚ Billionaires don't deserve to live, fascists don't either. Veganism is for privileged people who've never had to make a budget. Climate change is real, and we've gone too far past the point of no return, to return. Ai generative art is slop for the talentless to feel special for 3 seconds. I would sho*t a billionaire if given the chance, and lack of consequences. Pizza doesn't deserve to be insulted with pineapple. I would dump the billionaire's body in the ocean. Cats are better than dogs. The entire government should be abolished and power returned to the people. The Trump assassin should've taken target practice, and not missed. Cheese gives me cramps. The only thing that's going to save the world is direct action in its most extreme form, because we had our chance for it to not be extreme almost a decade ago, and we failed.
