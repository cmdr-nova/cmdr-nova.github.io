It's kind of even more egregious that the response _on_ Threads to the official account seemingly endorsing JK Rowling was like 99% negative, and Meta just left it up, ignored the backlash, pretended it didn't happen and kept on postingLike for a while now I've assumed this is the new strategy brands are taking with their shitty posts on social media, but damn man, all flowery talk about building a place to be nice and on a whim you endorse Hairy Ploppers
