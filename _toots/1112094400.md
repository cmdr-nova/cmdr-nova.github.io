Thought about making a web frontend for my “daily Reddit report” that sends me trending threads in my chosen subreddits every morning, and finding a way to switch it to mbin/lemmy, so other people can use itBut I’m thinking this would require me to pay for an email service cause right now my VPS is what’s sending me mail lol
