Finally have an appropriate microphone and stand for streaming, moved the two games I like to play currently to my SSD so I'm not desyncing while live (the HDD falls behind the speed of my PC lol) annnnndd I probably won't get to actually stream until later tonight or tomorrow nightI need some real talk advice on how to maintain things like this while working an offline jobThe goal is to eventually not have to work for someone else and instead, myself, but goddang I'm freakin tired most of the time
