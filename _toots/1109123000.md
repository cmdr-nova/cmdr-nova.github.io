this MAY be confusing to use unless you're kind of advanced at doing this stuffI had to include a proxy server function in order for this to work because of constant CORS errors, and I'm assuming other people will run into this toobut, no matter! you can setup a proxy server on a VPS with like 5 dollars a month, and I also think there may be free ones out there? I dunno, I just hosted my own on my existing VPS that is running a ton of python scripts
