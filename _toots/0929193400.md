I decided to stick to using Apple Music, because I like how it's a bit higher quality, ultimately cheaper, and music and podcasts are organized way betterBut Apple Music basically doesn't interact with last.fm or listenbrainz at all, and I have to upload listens manually with scanningwish I could find a way around this
