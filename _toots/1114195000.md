Sweet, my scripts all shared my new post to different places as IT SHOULD, without issue lolNow if I can just figure a way for the post ID from Mastodon to auto-insert itself into a post once it's shared on Mastodon, so that I don't have do it it manually, I'll be completely to the point of _only having to write and click commit_
