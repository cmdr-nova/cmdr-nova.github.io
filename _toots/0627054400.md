I don't know why this person did a personal mention for this, but I want to point out that this Reddit state of mind is an issue I've been raising since I joined Mastodon in 2017Independent artists, musicians, and writers are not equivalent to commercial corporate entities, and if you're trying to privately suggest that independent creators will be muted if they talk about what they do, congratulationsYou are the reason people don't come here
