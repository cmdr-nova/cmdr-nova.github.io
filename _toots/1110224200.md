the article in-question: https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/25/24108872/bluesky-ceo-graber-federation-social-media-decoder-interviewI haven't fully finished it because I was pretty annoyed by the interviewer interrupting legitimate questions with the constant "what about jack dorsey" and "what do you think jack dorsey thinks"but they touch on the topic of bridgy fed and how mastodon kind of seemed to explode in opposition to it when it emerged, and i think that's unfortunate. it gave a bad impression
