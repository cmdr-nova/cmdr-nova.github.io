I dunno, even attempting to ignore Meta's insistance to inject AI into all their platforms, Threads feels hollow. You get interactions easier, so there's people to potentially talk to, but it seems superficial. The timeline is cluttered with people stealing content from others, copy/pasting viral posts, uploading tik toks they didn't make, all trying to get massive likes and sharesIt makes me wanna puke, kinda
