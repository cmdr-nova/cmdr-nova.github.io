bluesky, trans community, slurscasually scrolling through months and months of bluesky posts in the trans community and finding out the one person who was building a mute list based on who she liked and didn't like (and it was huge) got run off the site, or did something bad (not sure what finally broke the camel's back but I'd take a guess it was laurelai baily behind an alt account)one of the same people on there, who, when i first joined during the months that bluesky was still closed facilitated throwing me on numerous mute lists for asking her apparent g/f to give some kind of a warning when she's about to say tranny unfiltered there can be justice, one time, as a treat
