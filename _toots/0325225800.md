#ThreadipactAs some, or many, may know, a lot, or maybe even just a few instances across the activitypub fediverse have pacted to block federation with the corporate giant Meta, or to be more specific, Threads. Threads is a new take on the Twitter experience, meant to be a kinder, less hostile place to post. All-in-all, after about six or seven months, I might call it only really marginally better.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/26/threadipact/
