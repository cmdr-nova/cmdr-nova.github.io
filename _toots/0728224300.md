this was hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of work, and I remember deleting that old Wordpress where they were hosted and I bit my tongue, because I thought I lost all of that work foreverAnd I kept thinking that for OVER A YEARuntil TODAY, when it clicked, that I could just find them on wayback machine, and copy/paste them directly into my current website
