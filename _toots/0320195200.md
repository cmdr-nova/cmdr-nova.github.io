trying to get used to Gimp and holy shit it's such an obtuse programI paste an object into a project i'm working on, and I can't resize it or move it with any expected shortcuts, and if I try and drag it down my ... mouse grabs another layer and moves that insteadare we intentionally doing the opposite of what photoshop does in order to stick it to the man or can we design this better lol
