has anyone else who drives to and from work noticed lately that lots of people are driving way way worse than usuali've been witness to at least 7 near accidents in the past 3 days, and yesterday almost had a guy roll his truck right over me in a crosswalk and he didn't even react to me asking him wtf he was doing
