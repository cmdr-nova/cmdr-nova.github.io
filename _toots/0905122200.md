Violence, dreamsI had a dream last night that I disappeared a whole bunch of people myself, with my own hands, and as I was waking up I also dreamt there was a news anchor on my tv talking about something like “one victim, whose been missing for well over a year, may finally have a prime suspect”And I honestly stood in the shower thinking “I didn’t do any of that, right???”I’ve been listening to far too much true crime
