every time I see a grown adult who appears to be obscenely rich or at least very well-off, on social media, on _video_, failing simple math questions that have to do with addition and subtractionI think back to that time in 11th grade were my teacher in math noticed I wasn't keeping up, and instead of tutoring me and helping me, she put me in remedial math (a completely different class)And now I'm 39, most of my money goes to debt, and I'm writing code, and people who know much less than me are swimming in money, and can't calculate 2+2
