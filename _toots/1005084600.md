This 80 y/o in here at 8:30am asking me about the difference between extension cords and voltage and wattage, and me like “ma’am I’m sorry I’m not an electrician and I can’t give you advice because that’d make me liable if I’m wrong” and then she continues talking, I repeat what I said and she goes “how much do you make im about to get a job here”It’s too early for this lol
