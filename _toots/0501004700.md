youtube has a lot of neglectful, murderous parents true crime stories and the question remainswhy tf don't these people just put their kids up for adoption if they don't want emi don't want kids, if I had one I'm not sure what I'd do. maybe I would suddenly want kids, maybe I would decide it's not right for me and choose adoptionI definitely wouldn't become a life-in-prison sort of criminal
