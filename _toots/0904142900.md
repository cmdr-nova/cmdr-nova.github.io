Every time I read someone being like "I was asked to choose a server, and go over the guidelines and I just don't have time for that" Like, are ya hopped up on 17 cups of coffee? Are you working 4 jobs in a day? You can't read something for 60 seconds before you make a decision?Are you being for _real_?
