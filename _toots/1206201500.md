I've been in a back and forth with USPS for days now, because I keep trying to tell them that they lost my order from a website that needed signing, that just happened to come at the same time some tax collector jackasses sent me an envelope that needed signing, and because the people at USPS are utter geniuses, they somehow mixed these two things together under one tracking number and completely lost my order.And in their back and forth it's just "we delivered both of the items in your order, the document and the package"And I have to keep telling them over and over "the document was not part of the package. it was not part of my order. it was a mistake USPS made. you never delivered any package."I swear to god
