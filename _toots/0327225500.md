Prompt: Comprehension, and Einstein’s Theory of RelativityWhat’s something most people don’t understand? This is an interesting prompt, because there is no way in the world I could possibly know what the average consensus of people usually don't understand. I could say, "Most people don't understand that the genre of Cyberpunk is a warning, not an aspiration." But, is that true? Is that really something most people don't understand?https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/28/prompt-comprehension-and-einsteins-theory-of-relativity/
