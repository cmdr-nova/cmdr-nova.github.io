Today on Nova Prime: https://nova.mkultra.monster/scripting/2024/11/15/never-update-your-name-or-avatar-again.htmlThis morning, I woke up from three and a half hours of sleep after a long overnight shift, and decided I wanted to change some things on this site. The first thing I did was delete a bunch of fluff from the sidebars. The next thing I did was make some JavaScript that automatically updates my avatar and author name on posts (and other pages) with whatever I’m using on Mastodon, completely dynamically.
