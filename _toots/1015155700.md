someone on reddit just found out that kickasstorrents was sezied by the US gov't and i was reading the page, and it directly cites "willfull copyright infringement" as a crime that includes up to 250,000 USD fines and possible jail timeokay US gov't, so why doesn't this apply to Sam Altman and OpenAI
