and mind you, THIS is what's keeping me from finding a place to rent. The cost of living being skyhigh, and these goshdanged credit card paymentsThis is why I'm trying to go very hard on sharing my Patreon much moreIf I do this myself it'll probably take all year, and I'll be brokeIf I can find help in forms of support for the work I do, it'll be easier
