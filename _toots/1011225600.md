before i left work yesterday for my 3 day weekend, my boss found junk customers had shoved behind product on the shelves, so she threw it all on the floor and she was like "i have concerns i have concerns" and was clearly pissed and walked awaymy concern is, i desperately need to find a sane job that isn't ruled by complete chaos and unrealistic standards
