Realizing one of the main things keeping me from dating is that Iâ€™ve got it in my head that Iâ€™m too good for rejection, and that I work too hard, am too stressed to _deal_ with potential rejection.Like a pre-emptive, how dare you? Do you know what I deal with on a daily basis ðŸ˜‚Like, rejection usually isnâ€™t personal, happens all the time, but I refuse to speak to matches I get on apps because I just donâ€™t have the emotional space to be rejected
