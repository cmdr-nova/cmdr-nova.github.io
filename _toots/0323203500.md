Got myself a group of pawns in #dragonsdogma2 and by chance they all happened to be women, and to my surprise one of them made a remark about that lolAnd then about 15 minutes later I saved and quit to the title and the game got stuck on a black screen lolDefinitely, definitely a bit unstable, but cool!
