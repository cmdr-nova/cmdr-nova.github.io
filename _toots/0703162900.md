So back in the early 90s when I made my original jump onto a PC and then the internet, there was this thing called "usenet"We never had it in my household because it cost extra money, but I THINK I remember seeing pieces of it on compuserv or prodigyLo and behold, Usenet still exists today ... kind of as a way to share movies, but also apparently illegal shitBut the thing that threw me a little is, it _sounds_ like the concept of Mastodon, without the file downloadsMakes me wonder why the devs here call Mastodon similar to e-mail, instead of something more like, a social usenet
