RE: My latest blog postI really would like outside opinions on what others think. I have many conflicted feelings about Threads vs. MastodonMy love for the fediverse, open software, linux, and building a free future, while also being a content creator who has struggled to really build ... any kind of an audience here, while it's been so confusingly simple to do on Threads, even though that could collapse as soon as tomorrow lolI'm currently not blocking Threads, but using both simultaneously, and I want to know what people who interact with me on here think for real. Or better yet, how anyone on here has built an audience of thousands of people
