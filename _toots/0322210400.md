whoa wait a minute, Larian HAD plans for DLC for BG3, and then decided to scrap that, and then also any prospect of BG4Nah there's something else gotta be going on besides development fatigue You don't just treat Baldur's Gate 3, a critical success, as if it's BioWare's Anthem and then walk away thinking that seems normal
