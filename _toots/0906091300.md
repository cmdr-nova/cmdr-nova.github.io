is it a #bandcampfriday ? Ever since I left and deleted Twitter I've been completely out of the loop when these 100% sale days happenBut just in case it is! Recently, I had to spend a ton of money out of pocket so that my car would pass inspection, I cancelled most frivolous subscriptions, and am now trying to recoupI have 27 releases under #Eyeshadow2600FM - https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/musicAnd am slowly working on a new release under the new name, #PLEXX - https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux#bandcamp #music #darksynth #electro #synthwave
