I would hazard a guess that someone or some people are pissed about my militant anti-AI stance, because it would be very easy to take a picture I have up on here (like the avatar I'm using), select pieces of the subject with Photoshop's selection tool, and then provide a screenshot of that in an email claiming that you own itIn an attempt to damage what I'm doing here
