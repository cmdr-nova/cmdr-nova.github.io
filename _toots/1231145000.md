it was mentioned to me that using the same domain across multiple installations of mastodon, and with separate software even, could be destructive, or _is_ destructive (albeit, my sharkey instance was at sharkey.mkultra.monster, but still)and, after checking, it looks like other mastodon instances, including those that have been open since 2017, have no issue seeing my posts as they're posted, as of nowBUTWafrn, and/or a couple misskey/sharkey instances that I'm on, seem to be hours and hours behind federating with my postsHmm
