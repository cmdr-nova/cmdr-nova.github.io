over the past 3 months I gotta say I feel like toot.io's managed hosting is pretty legit. i still am not sure how they're crunching media storage so well, and I have some federation issues (probably because of the 2 previous versions of this instance on digital ocean being cached on activitypub) but aside from that, it's like I'm on mastodon.social
