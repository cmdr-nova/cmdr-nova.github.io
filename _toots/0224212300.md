ChallengesWhat is the biggest challenge you will face in the next six months? I think the most challenging thing for me will be establishing myself in a new place of work, and in-turn working through consolidating or otherwise lowering the amount of debt that I owe. Debt’s a troubling thing, especially when it comes from the loss of a pet, and the swindlers behind veterinarian offices.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/02/25/challenges/
