I finally got a reply from utoots.com, the new group of people who are scraping the fedi They talk about “developing tools” to remove accounts from relays they subscribe to, but as far as I understand they’re not using activitypub and this is just a scrapeWhich is highly evident from this person who had the audacity to generate a bot response for an email address I’m almost certain is maintained by like one guy
