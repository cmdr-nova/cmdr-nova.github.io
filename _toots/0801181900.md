I'm reading on how to create a simple dark mode toggle for my website, and ... is it just me, or are MOST of the jekyll tutorials incompletely written?This jumps from, "let's put some code into your index.html" to "okay, here's some scripts or something, and you're done!"thanks manthanks for explaining what the hell you're supposed to do with these scriptshttps://randomwits.com/blog/dark-mode-jekyll
