It's really a bummer that everyone is basically just being forced to use Patreon and only Patreon lolbut I mean, I HAVE had my Patreon since 2012 and it does have subscribersI just wanted a way to make my website my "own" PatreonCan't have everything though, in a corporate, capitalist system that's trying to keep everyone poor and sad
