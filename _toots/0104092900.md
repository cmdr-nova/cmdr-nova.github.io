So I started Squid Game 2 last night (finally), and within a 5 minute span in like the 3rd episode we have a guy talking about "I need to get out of here to check my crypto bro!", someone arguing with them about pump and dump scams, and then out of left field comes a trans woman without any issue whatsoeverSeems pretty good so farBut I do have to continually question why studios like Activision are making game modes out of the death scenes/games as if they don't understand what any of this is about at all
