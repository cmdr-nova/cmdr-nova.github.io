so I asked this question the day after the election and didn't really get an answer: does anyone think it'd be a good idea to have an instance moved from the US to somewhere overseas?I pay toot.io and I _think_ I can ask them to do that, and I definitely wouldn't want my server in Virginia to be seized for any reason
