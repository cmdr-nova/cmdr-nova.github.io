The previous iteration of this instance (that was hosted by toot.io) had a few users, one who was an active particpant for about a month and then she appeared to _completely_ disappear from MastodonSo if you're out there (I think you were lesbian breadstick, or something??), no I didn't delete your account (I relaunched and self hosted)
