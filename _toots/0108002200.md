I'm exploring Pillowfort, cause my brain is still kind of buzzing from more and more platforms going bust and it is a VERY closed-off community. Not in that people don't want to talk.But in that there is no mode of discovery unless you specifically search for what you're looking for.It's kind of mystical in a way, like you fell into the backrooms, but there's pillows and you're like "HELLO? CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?"
