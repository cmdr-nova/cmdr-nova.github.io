looking for more subreddits to add to my bot, looks like a handful of the anime subs have been taken over by insufferable mods with rules that are copy/pasted saying "no harassment over AI art, no yucking someone's yum"if your "yum" is glossy 7 fingered stolen work, the only thing you deserve is yuck ya doofus
