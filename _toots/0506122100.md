Trying to decide if I want to keep paying for my own mastodon instance (which has been much preferred, the moderator of my content and posts who knows best is ME lol), move to another instance (and potentially deal with bad mods who ban you if you talk back to bullies lol), or just post from Threads (wildly unpopular choice, I know)
