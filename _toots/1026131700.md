Talking about this cat I saw on the road earlier today and not about of people seem to care, but like, do people know that these animals, despite being primitive, they have feelings, they dream when they sleepTheir lives may be short, but they are lives that we coexist with and to see one ended because someone didn’t stop their damn car, It’s upsetting
