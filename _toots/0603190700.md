Sims 4 is like my legacy game, something I basically have to play lolBack in the day of being a bit isolated and only sitting in front of my computer, I only had the basegame and I was JUST getting into itSomeone on here, whomst I don't know if I should name anymore, bought me the vampire pack andIt all started there
