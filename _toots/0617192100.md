I keep seeing someone on here share vegan posts like "Unlike animal abusers, I eat salads" or some shiteAnd I gotta wonder if people like this are aware that animals die in the farming process, people are abused and underpaid for it as wellEat meat, eat plants. Doesn't matter, it's all unethical in the system we currently adhere to
