I mentioned this in my article, but this is a big problem, because I _just_ recently wrote a post recommending people who don't like the concept of Mastodon, to just use Threads.I don't know if I can recommend that now.Before, it was just Threads and Meta being their usual selves, which, I felt I could personally just deal with in order to spread the reach of my creative works.Now? Not so muchI think everyone should probably get more comfortable with the concept of not using corporate social media, even if it means playing the "content creator" game on Dark Souls mode
