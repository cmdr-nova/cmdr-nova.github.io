The Year is 1995You're sitting at a wooden desk in front of a mammoth of a PC tower. It's beige and blocky; the buttons are chunky. Its idling sounds like the low hum of an aircraft taking off, and the hard drive clicks like a woodpecker having a seizure. It's late November 1995, and you've just installed the new Windows ... 95. This was a process that took many hours, as you had to reformat your hard drive, and that is not a simple, or even quick task.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/29/the-year-is-1995/
