What if someone built the backrooms in second life, but instead of listing it as a place to search and visit, you only get to the sim through random teleportation that other sim owners put on their landSo that it’s like, a real backrooms experience hahaWould be really cool, if a sim didn’t cost 250 dollars a month lol
