Just realized I boosted the patreon of a mutual who's openly posting AI sludge. Gonna have to go and reverse that

Like, don't sit here and read about how bad and even tentatively fascist generative slop is, directly from my account, and then ignore all of that like some kind of emotionally-dead jerk, and ask people to boost your patreon
