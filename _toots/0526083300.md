For my birthday today I obviously want people to check out all of my work, and all thatBut I also want people online in-general to think about how they interact with others. To stop codifying apathy and anti-empathy into their political takes. I don't ever wanna be told that I'm "on my own" and "nobody cares" about my mental health and my struggles ever again, by anyone
