Whoa okay, so since they'd already flimed 6 weeks of BTTF with Eric Stoltz, they used all the same footage in the final cut, but just replaced the scenes with Stoltz with MJF and left everything else untouchedThat's wildThat means there are scenes where Doc is talking to a completely different MartyThis is more mind bending than was originally planned by the writers
