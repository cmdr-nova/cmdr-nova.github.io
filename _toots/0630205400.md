one of the biggest problems right now on Threads, aside from the AI all over the place and Meta saying they'll pay you for getting tons of views and then that not happening lolis the mass content theft, or, people copy/pasting popular posts to the point where the search for that phrase is an endless stream of people all saying exactly the same thingthis is not a problem on mastodon, will never be a problem on mastodonwhen i said engagement farming was a disease i meant it lol
