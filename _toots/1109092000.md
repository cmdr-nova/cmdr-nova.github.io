politics, safety, i don't understand peopleI just saw someone say "have a safehouse in another state" and maybe I'm interpreting that wrong, but if I'm not, I think _everyone_ in the United States could do with empathy training lolMfers don't say "have a second house" without being completely and utterly tone-deaf and blind to the struggles that are happening all around them
