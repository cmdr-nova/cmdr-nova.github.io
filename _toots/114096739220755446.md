Playing through KC2 reminds me of what it was like the first time I played Rimworld

I did what I thought I needed to do, and everything went bad ðŸ˜‚

In Rimworld, I led my people to cannibalism in the winter, and the final remaining villagers died in a shootout fueled by paranoia

In Kingdom Come 2, I try to help people, and end up a murderer. Five times. And suddenly your character is stumbling drunk back to bed in the only town nobody knows he's a criminal
