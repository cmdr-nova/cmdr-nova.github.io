relationship-ish stuff, or whatever it is lolso i met a guy in vr chat, and we've been spending all of or most of my evenings together playing games and watching movies, and in the past 3 days he's been like doing this one-word answers to things I say or askso yesterday afternoon I asked him what's wrong, why no talk very much, and he promptly stopped speaking entirelyI think if I was still 22 this would greatly affect me but at 39 i'm just not about these games
