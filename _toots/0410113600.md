one of the things I like about Kane Pixel's backrooms project is that it just has the howler entityand honestly that's all it needspeople on youtube getting hyperfocused on 999+ backrooms levels with all kinds of entities, some that are completely ridiculous, that takes away from the scariness and makes it feel kind of immature (just like tumblr fandoms lol)
