Bluesky, Fediverse, doesn't really matter in the end, because everything's gonna be federated at some point and where you're posting from will have little meaningBut it's still wild seeing posts like this on other sites in 2024 instead of 2016, at the launch of MastodonIt took years for Linux to be adoptable for the average person, let alone what kind of skills you'd need to compile a kernal.Stating that choosing a server and making sure it has decent community guidelines is harder than that, is just being disingenous
