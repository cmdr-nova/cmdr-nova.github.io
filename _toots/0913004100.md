In Kane Pixel's found footage 2, the camera person (kid?) stumbles upon a car that somehow slapped into the backrooms, and then a wall at high speedthis video in Kane's backrooms playlist shows how that happened, and I'm not sure how I didn't see it the last 3 times I watched this playlist lolhttps://youtu.be/a7ckzgIgx_o?si=2aju68DpNN6Bzlvl
