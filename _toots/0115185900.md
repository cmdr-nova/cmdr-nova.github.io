Listening to the Vanished podcast, this woman goes missing without a trace on a dirt/desert trail in a canyon. No footprints, no tire marks, no human waste, no body for miles and miles around the epicenter of her disappearance Bro, there’s gotta be some kind of “oops I slipped through a quantum tunnel now I’m in another universe” phenomenon
