When I was laying in bed earlier, and I should mention I'm still incredibly tired, and about to go into work, I was thinking about how I kind of feel like I only want to post on my website mostly, even though I continue to post on social sites

But I'm just tired of all the bad ideas, the bad people, the bait, the engagement bait, the annoyances, the people trying to steal your attention so that more of your time can be wasted
