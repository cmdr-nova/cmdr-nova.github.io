So I finished Squid Game 2 last night, and the trans woman in the second season is especially interesting to me. Because her story is an exact, and I mean exact mirror of what happened to me when I started transitionAnd it was like a mirror of myself, looking into myself, asking me when I think it's going to be okay to resume transitioning, if everA feeling and a train of thought that I complete block myself off from feeling or thinking aboutNot sure what life is going to be the next 30 or 40 years, and I'm not sure who I am, honestly
