2:30am watching someone actually break down the movie Gamer, because the couple times I watched it I was honestly distracted by the camera going in 50 directions every 30 secondsI did not notice the prisoner flying away into the sky unexplained, or all of the other errors. And come to think of it, none of the characters have any backstory or reason for doing what they're doingI still think that it was a movie way ahead of it's time. Should've been done better, and in 2024
