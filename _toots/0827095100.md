cohost, ai, little bit of a rantLast week I went on Cohost and commented on their latest update, and their weak stance on AI, and replied to someone saying something like "Understandable, it must be hard to moderate out potential AI users" and I commented that "actually it's easy, I run a Mastodon instance" and then they asked how many users I have, as if to infer that it's easy because I have a low number of people hereBut, actually, catching potential AI-lover signups IS easy, but also moderating the federated timeline is as simple as scrolling and hitting suspend.Why? Because not a whole lot of people are in on the grift, and making the ones who are disappear is very simple, and I refuse to believe Cohost can't have one community moderator blast them all into the sun. No, they just want to appease folks who throw sludge into their cycle of posts
