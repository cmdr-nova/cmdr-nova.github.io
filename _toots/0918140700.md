The Sims 5 isn’t happening, I’m glad because I’m attached to my many many save files in Sims 4 and I don’t want to start from zero with no content again, but at the same time I can see that EA isn’t doing Sims 5 because Sims 4 has netted them over a billion dollars (not hyperbole) and why get rid of it?
