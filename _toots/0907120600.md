My link page is turning into one of the most awesome things I've ever made, and, I'll detail this in my post on Buffer, but what I did was I ripped their start page, deleted all the link trackers, renamed all the CSS elements to something humerous, moved the CSS to its own file (because why tf do you have it on the same page as the content?), enlarged the avatar, dropped the gif at the top down a bit, removed the FA icons and replaced them with Phosphur, and replaced the static "update" box with a live feed of my blog ðŸ˜‚ https://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/
