alcohol relatedseeing someone talk about spending years drinking 25-30 drinks a day, and then having to ween themselves off, and thinking about how _bad_ alcohol makes me feel even after just having one drinkI've been sober for over a month, not even a single drink, and you know what, I don't know if I want to be drunk ever again
