via Gemini:"A terraformed Titan with a clear atmosphere would offer breathtaking views of Jupiter. It would be a celestial wonder, dwarfing any view of Jupiter we can experience from Earth.Please note: This is a hypothetical scenario. Terraforming Titan is a complex and challenging endeavor, and it's not currently within our technological capabilities."No frikken shit dude, do you think I'm trying to go out and terraform Titan right now?Thing is tho, I can't verify that any of this is actually true. I know Jupiter and Saturn are relatively "close", but I don't want to just be like "oh yeah, you could definitely see jupiter if titan didn't have a hazy sky" and then look like an idiot when I find out that's incorrect for some reason
