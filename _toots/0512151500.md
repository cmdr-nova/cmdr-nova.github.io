I remember early in my mastodon journey, probably like 2018, I had a guy helping me figure out how to navigate Linux, cron jobs, and activitypub installs. Don’t even remember what instance he came fromHe helped me a lot, and then suddenly a topic came up and he started talking about not wanting to raise his daughter around lgbtq+ people, and that my friends is why I dont touch Pleroma with a 70 foot pole anymore
