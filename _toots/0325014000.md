Prompt: Just Say NoHow often do you say “no” to things that would interfere with your goals? This is kind of an ambiguous question, at least for me, because I have a lot of goals. But by and large, most of my goals have to do with either learning new things, doing creative work in my free time, and advancing at work. In the past four years I’ve always said “No” to things that got in the way of my … work goals.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/25/prompt-just-say-no/
