Yeah I dunno if I fully agree with that one article I read on Veilguard, at least not yet. It has that whole "we're assembling a team" vibe, but less in the vibe of "the avengers" and more just like exactly what the theme was in Mass Effect 2, whichIf someone under 30 is writing articles like that, they probably haven't ever played it
