the cool thing about the POOLS game (on steam) is that it doesn't explictly say IT IS the backrooms, it says it's _based_ on it (and extremely online people like me know that the pool rooms are just another level beneath the infinity hallway maze)but also, there is a level in POOLS that is actually the backrooms
