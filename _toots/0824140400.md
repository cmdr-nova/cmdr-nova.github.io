About halfway to starting my weekend and lemme tell ya, my arms feel like they’re being held up by splints except those splints are my bones lolAbout to screw with my website for two days straight, but I also wanted to share my thanks for those who’ve helped out with these car repair charges, and that on Monday I’ll have to pay the other 800 usd for the final amount of workCheck this post for links if you can help: https://nova.mkultra.monster/fundraiser/2024/08/17/urgent-financial-help-needed
