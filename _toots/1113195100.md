I asked out this trans girl I've known for a handful of years, that i met through my job in the last building I worked at, but I dunno if she'll actually want to go on a date because it took me like 3 years and very sporadic texting to ask lolSuch is my nature, I stop talking to everyone for months at a time and then I'm like "oh hey what's up"
