I saw that this place was said to be a free speech zone, so I went into it expecting to see Trump memes and burning crosses everywhere but I honestly didn't really see that.I saw some people hollering about how great they think Trump is, but MOST of what I saw is people so deep into bitcoin obsession it's kind of scary
