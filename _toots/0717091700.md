Been spending a lot of time exploring Nostr and talking to people who populate the network. It’s not the bad place a lot of people think it is, as long as you treat your personal account like a mastodon instance and mute what you don’t likeThere is a conundrum though, the network has opened my eyes to what decentralization really is, and mastodon kinda sorta only really goes halfway there Maybe the ATProtocol/Nostr is what it should actually be. I know I’m not the only one shelling out cash for an instance just so I don’t lose everything to trigger happy admins
