politicsMy head kinda hurts and I just think that a lot of people in this country need help. But they need help away from society, they need help away from other people where they can't be a danger to those around them.This society is sick, and diseased, and I'm so glad I get to witness another national tragedy in the 20 some years its been since I watched the towers explode on live TV
