PoliticsI don’t have a lot of faith in the political system, mainly because we keep having to choose between no real change or outright fascismAnd it’s just wild to me that someone who is so plainly fascistic is even allowed to run, let alone walk free on the streets, to sit and be comfortable, and sleep soundlyThat is in and of itself not only a crime, but a crime against humanity, and decency
