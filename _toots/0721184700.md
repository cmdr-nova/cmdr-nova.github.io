watching commentary on videos of weirdos recording people in public for contentso like here's the dealif some jerkoff starts recording you in public and you don't like it, pull out your phone, turn on whatever apple music or spotify has right on the home screen (usually top of the billboard crap) and hit playand keep it on until the person recording stops lolnow they can't monetize you for content
