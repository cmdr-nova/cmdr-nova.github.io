All this AI bullfrickery reminds me of years back when I was out of a job and making music, trying like hell to make a living, and an indie film producer contacted me, wanted to use one of my tracks in his filmI asked him for a one-time 20 dollar fee (hundreds and hundreds of dollars lower than it should've been) and he decided not to use the trackAnd now we live in an era of rampant theft, huhInteresting
