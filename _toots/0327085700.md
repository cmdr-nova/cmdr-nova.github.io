bluesky, trans community, slursit's already confusing enough to not currently be transitioning, to not really know where my identity actually is anymore, or if i'll ever continue, or go back to who i was 4 years agobut to watch the community that i've largely not been able to ever really find real community in, turn into this weird mess of slurring their peers without any thought for the damage and pain this can causejust makes it more confusing
