Prompt: Failure and SuccessHow has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? In my lifetime I’ve failed many times, and I’ve had many successes. There are things I fail at more than others, but the one big takeaway is that failure precludes success. What I mean by that, is that I fully believe in the idea that, if at first you don’t succeed, try again.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/05/prompt-failure-and-success/
