I'm putting together a quick little bot that automatically posts my newest blog posts to Mastodon, but I have to make it so it archives every single thing in the feed that already exists into a json that acts as an ignore listBecause of the way Jekyll acts, sometimes when I update my website, my feed items re-push and re-share things that have already been shared (which is annoying)but if I force it to not do that with an ignore list, the problem is solved
