Being offered extra overtime to possibly work on a day off, and as much as I want to look good at work and put in extra effort, I don’t know how to explain to bosses at work that despite how far I’ve come in the past 4 years, I feel like I don’t exist and I feel like my life is going nowhere, and working even more won’t fix me
