Someone on Reddit commenting on my post about my getting started guide for Mastodon saying, basically, that if a guide like that has to exist, then Mastodon is a design failure But, listen, I could write a guide _just as long and in-depth_ about getting started on Bluesky, including with instructions on using your own domain I could write detailed instructions on how to get started on Twitter that are also as detailed (but I won’t do that lol)I think the real problem is that a lot of people have this unexplained internal bias toward the Fediverse and hardly anyone can coherently explain _why_
