speaking of connections, and people talking to me, i'm tired of meeting people in #secondlife who want to make a connection with me, whether friendly or romantic, but also don't want to put any effort at all into ... maintaining that connectioni refuse to be the initiator of all things lol i have other things i like and want to do, and there needs to be effort on other people's part
