Seeing random things on bsky, more things kind of solidifying that it hasn't changed one bit since its doors were closed (toxic, asshole-infested)It's wild to me that there are people out there who know of me, and don't like me and/or hate me based on things I'm completley unaware of, or things I've said in the past (because I don't mince words, I tell people to fuck off without a second of pause)I mean not everyone is going to like you, but to be mostly posting to myself with some pals on Mastodon and have a contigency of weirdos who seethe about an imaginary version of me I'm mostly unaware even existsis fuckin weird
