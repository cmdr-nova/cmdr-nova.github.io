watching someone's analysis of 10 Cloverfield Lane years and years after it's been outreally is a great movie, and despite critics, I really enjoyed Cloverfield Paradox too, mostly because it deals in weird space themes that hardly anyone else ever explores in moviesFound footage movies be danged, the 2nd and 3rd Cloverfields are a must watch
