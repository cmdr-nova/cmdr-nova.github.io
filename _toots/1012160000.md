Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsWhoops, Now I’m Sickhttps://nova.mkultra.monster/thoughts/2024/10/12/whoops-now-i-m-sick.htmlIt’s not every week, or even every month that I have off three days in a row from my offline job. It’s a chance to catch up on projects I’ve been slacking on due to lack of energy, a chance to think of new things I want to put out into the world, and a chance to maybe finally continue the manuscript for my next book. But, like usual, for some reason? I’m sick. I felt it coming when I was on my last day of work for the week, and then I got home, passed out, and woke up yesterday feeling week, and coughing. Yay!
