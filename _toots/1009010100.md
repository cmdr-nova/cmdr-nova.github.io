I gotta apologize briefly for getting beside myself with this random report against my bot that came from an instance but no user I can identify?I’ve spent days and days leaning to do things I’ve never done before, and one of them is a bot that posts automatically and at randomSome stranger calling it spam and demanding it do things that I don’t think are technically possible is ... well about what I would expect from some places around here, but damn let me revel in my creations for at least a day lol
