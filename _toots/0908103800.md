There's a lot of weirdness in the Minecraft movie trailer. Part of it is, yeah, this is probably mostly directed at kids ... even though Minecraft came out when I was still in my 20s (39 now lol)But some people are saying Jack Black in the role of Steve makes no sense, because he doesn't "look" like SteveMy rebuttal to that is: Steve, in actual Minecraft, has very little facial features, and ... I kind of felt it was obvious that Jack Black is playing a version of Steve that is decades into the future (if this is wrong then I don't understand this movie at all)
