Yeah I don't know if this would work, because if you setup a Python script to be a server/actor over ActivityPub and tell it to grab whatever's the latest post from your _posts directory on a Jekyll site, likenavigating to that link myself on my own site is a 403 forbidden link... I don't think the script would be able to see it either unless my brain is just juice right now
