Alright, the Warframe mission "destroy the narmer murex" is utterly impossible lolEither you fight through waves and waves and waves of enemies to fire your artillery at the mega ship, and then die as your shields melt away in secondsOr you ignore all the enemies to fire your artillery and then die in seconds
