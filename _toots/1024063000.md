Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsDestroy All Webp Imageshttps://nova.mkultra.monster/programming/2024/10/24/destroy-all-webp-images.htmlI started learning Python, because I wanted to solve problems, and maybe eventually make a Python game. I haven’t made it to being able to do the latter all that well yet, and maybe sometime here in the near future, we’ll get there. But today, I’m solving a big problem. A problem brought on by Google/Reddit. Or, I should say, I’m destroying all .webp images, once and for all.
