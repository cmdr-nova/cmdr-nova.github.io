So, the Mastodon feed JavaScript I found way back earlier in the year when I launched my site on Jekyll was pretty great, but I had one issue with itIt was just detached text that links to a post you've made in an infinite updating feed, which for all intents and purposes is mostly fine, and I greatly appreciate the author of the original script (I don't remember who I got it from but they're here on Mastodon, possibly following me lol)Today, I modified that script so that the feed on my website looks as though it's a direct feed of my Mastodon account
