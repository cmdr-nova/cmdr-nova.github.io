so this is interesting, under debian at least, i load up Firestorm, memory usage rises to about 4 gigs for FS, I go to a heavily crowded sim and it jumps to 8 gigsI travel back to the place where it was only 4 gigs usage, but it stays at 8 gigsThink I was right when I assumed the Firestorm crashing problems are a Firestorm problem and not a Debian/Linux problem
