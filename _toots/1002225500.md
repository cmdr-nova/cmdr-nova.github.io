also saw someone on reddit posting on some "linux sucks" subreddit making fun of people who are like "haha windows has all the vulnerabilities, malware, and viruses" and their example that linux users are hypocrites was the xz crisis, which I think was patched immediately?and, not gonna lie, I haven't been involved in linux for 30 straight years, and only started dabbling in like 2014, and I'm sure there have been other vulnerabilities. But to only _know_ of ONE THING, I mean that's pretty hilarious
