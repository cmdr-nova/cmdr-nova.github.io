I'm a little bit interested in Apple Intelligence. I just updated to 18.1 but they're making me join a waitlist before I can have accessMy real question tho, no matter how much better this makes Siri at answering things for me ...What are Apple using to power this? If it ain't nuclear power, it's probably fossil fuels and water and that still makes me uncomfortable
