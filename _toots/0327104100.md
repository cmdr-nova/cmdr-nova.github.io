I think the one thing I've learned from the garbage experiences I've had on Bluesky, is that I actually don't want to let go of who I was before I had to return to the offline workforceThis could be construed as a good thing, but also bad, because I can't do anything about that (I can't continue my transition, not until I have an income that can't be taken from me)
