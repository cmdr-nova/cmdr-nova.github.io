Prompt: What’s Your Morning Ritual?What are your morning rituals? What does the first hour of your day look like? On most mornings I find myself literally crawling out of bed. See, I sleep on top of a mattress that’s topped with memory foam, that’s also topped with more memory foam. I basically sleep in one gushy square of foam, so getting up out of it is kind of a chore sometimes.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/04/01/prompt-whats-your-morning-ritual/
