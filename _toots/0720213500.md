This is an idea I've stolen from Nostr/ATProtocol, but their idea is to have the whole social network based on keys, but I think that's also not the correct way to do it.I think hosting your own instance, or joining instances with communities should stay, and you should also be able to take ownership of everything you post.Call the update the Mastodon: Become Immortal update, and have a bunch of cyberpunk themed graphics on the github page
