This person having a meltdown because I pointed out to them that trying to sell their patreon to people where they’re posting generative slop is bad, going off like “baby’s first power analysis” and “every tool is a fascist tool”

And has the audacity to say I need to make an original thought

The cognitive dissonance, the narcissism

Kye, you can rationalize it any way you want, but you can’t excuse trying to sell sludge that’s violated the consent of millions
