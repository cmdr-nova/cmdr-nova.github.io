Now, if illegal content comes through the Threads pipeline then that IS a great reason to suspend itAnd by all means, anyone can block and suspend Threads if they wantI just don't see a good enough reason to do it myself, because I'm not living in a shell where I'm only trying to have contact with 5 people (I am a creator, and I must eventually find success, I will not give up on that)
