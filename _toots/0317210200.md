when I was a literal teenager in 2001, I used to post on the quake 3 forums. I was pretty cringe, and some of the older men on there were a bit trollish alsoBut, flip the script and fast forward 20+ years and now I'm the older person on the forum that somehow still existshttps://www.quake3world.com
