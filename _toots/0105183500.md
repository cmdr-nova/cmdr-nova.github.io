as a millennial, as much as I like having a smartphone and everything ever available to me in my hand at all times, there's always this part of me that can never become _fully_ accustomed to doing everything on my phonepart of me just has to have the keyboard and PC sometimesbut even then, there are people out there who DO do everything on their phone and I don't know if I could ever become 100% used to that
