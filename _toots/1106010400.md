It was already hard enough being crushed by debt, working a shit job that I can't get out of because all of my skills are self taught, and the job market doesn't exist, being entirely single, no spouse, no extra income, haven't been to a doctor in 15 years, can't afford the dentist, every time I take my car to the shop it's hundreds to thousands of more debtAnd now it's going to be worseI don't know how much more I can takeWorld just kicking the shit out of you until you say "fuck it, I give up"
