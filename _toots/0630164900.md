this girl i met when i started at where i'm working now, with whom i was immediately infatuated with, and spent an entire day with, and we became pretty good work pals until she left for another jobshe comes back in every once in a while, but the time that she did today she ignored me when i said heyI'm almost certain this is one of those moments where I've totally missed something I must've done wrong, socially lol
