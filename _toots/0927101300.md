So, revisited Deadlock. I think it's pretty fun. Problem is, I got into a match that was _literally_ a deadlock. The opposing team is overpowered, but not powerful enough to just win already, and so my teammates and I are dying here and there and waiting over a minute to respawn.Fast-forward, it's been 45 minutes, still no progress in either direction lol And there was a Deadlock dev on my team
