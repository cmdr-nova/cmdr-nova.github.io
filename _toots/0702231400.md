I went on Threads one time today and responded to a post about someone being disgusted with Youtubers who use AI in thumbnailsI responded with something like, "Yeah any time I see that, I take the extra second to tell Youtube's algorithm to never show me that channel again"And hours later out of thin air I get this dude who's like "And yet you'll watch Mr. Beast who is full of synthetic content, fucking bullshit" and it's likePeople on corpo social media are so starved for attention that they'll create versions of you in their heads that don't exist so that they can be pissed off at you
