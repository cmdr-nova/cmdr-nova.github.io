I go on the ATT website to check how many installmants I have left on the couple of devices on my plan, and they advertise stuff to meLike the Galaxy Fold and I see it has a little "AI is here!" button on itDoes anyone actually care about this lol "i'm gonna buy this folding phone because it has AI, hurrah!"
