Anyway, we got the work done and I was able to come back home on time, and now I need to research if it's policy or not, to say "None of you can leave until all of this is done"But, earlier when I shared this I got some dudebro from nostr commenting like "you're not being held hostage, step aside if you're not going to work"Like, I know what his problem is: He's one of those fascist weirdos who think everyone should sacrifice themselves for profitBut if the option is, stay at work until you're "allowed" to go, or leave, and be reprimanded/fired, then yesYes it is being "held hostage"
