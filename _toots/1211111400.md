Racing against the clock to put something new in my Second Life store, but I don't think I'm going to make it, because I have 10 minutes until I need to start getting ready for work, and I need at least another hour to upload and post to socials ðŸ˜‚ I REALLY miss the days when I was just working on things I wanted to work on ... even if those were some of the worst days of my life (broke, mental health crisis, etc)
