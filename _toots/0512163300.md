I like to read the antinatalism subreddit, not because I'm 100% against anyone having kids, but I don't know if I ever willMy cat is my son anyway lolBut so many of these people are so close to grasping what's wrong with our society, irt money, and capitalism. So close they could touch it if they'd just go a little bit further in their thinking
