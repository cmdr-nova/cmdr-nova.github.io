Maybe this is Apple's way of pranking people who want AI to answer everything for them, but also if you're gonna give me a google search I'll just defer to google next time? I dunno, but in my work environment if I need to know what kind of oil filter by brand and model someone needs (because obviously i'm a mechanic) it helps to have the answer fast so I can get back to work
