Today via Nova Prime, I see a lot of people on other networks (like #Threads, #bluesky)  saying they don't like the fediverse, they can't find any places that are #queer or #sexworker friendly, or BOTHToday, I bring you a little list I've curated over a few hours, with the help of some people who are credited within this new post (that will be linked on my #ActivityPub informational page)https://www.nova-prime.net/social%20media/2024/08/13/twitter-is-viable-and-bicycles-are-boats.html
