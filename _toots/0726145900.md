Every time I see someone talking about experiencing bigotry worse than on Twitter, here on the fedi, I investigate the instance they’re on and nearly every single time the instance in question has virtually no common sense moderation policy on bigotry and no suspension list to be seen (altho I keep mine private here just for the hell of it)It makes me wonder if this is a failing of these specific users, or the software not making it clear enough how to join an instance with decent policies
