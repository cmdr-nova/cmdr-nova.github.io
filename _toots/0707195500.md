I kinda wanna stream ZZZ but I do wonder if there's a wall with the progression where the game nearly stops you entirely unless you pay or wait for the 24 hour timerGenshin doesn't really have this, which makes it great for streaming, but I am interested in figuring out if ZZZ has an infinite gameplay loop or not
