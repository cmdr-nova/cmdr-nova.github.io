Someone on Melonland posted about #cohost going away, and another poster shares their lack of sympathy, citing that the team was paying themselves lavish amounts of money and/or giving themselves exorbitant raises through the site's operationhttps://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=3355.0I could be wrong, but in the post they quote, I don't ... think they're saying they were paying themselves nearly 100,000 USD per person
