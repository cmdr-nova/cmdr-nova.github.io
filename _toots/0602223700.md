cw for booze talk (this will not show anything to bluesky users, I'm sorry lol)I haven't had a drink in over a week now, and I didn't think skipping drinking a beer for a couple days to avoid nasty headaches would maybe lead me back into a sobreity journey, but I can tell I have a problem, because CRAVING a beer, or some kind of alcoholic beverage ... is badI don't know how I got this wayI told myself "one drink a day is no big deal"but it is a big dealyou become dependent on that
