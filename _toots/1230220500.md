I always remember things that altered me in some way throughout my life, at complete random timesLike back in the 2nd grade when I partnered up with someone in class, because we were putting together a class newspaper, and myself and the other kid were to draw a comic, rightSo we drew this little mural of weird monsters attacking a city and had all sorts of neat things on it, and I was proud of myselfThe teacher comes by and picks it up, then says, "I don't get it. Is this supposed to be funny?"Little things that change you as a person, like the butterfly effect
