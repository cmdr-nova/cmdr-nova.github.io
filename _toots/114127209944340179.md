I've kind of lightened my opinion on Bluesky, in that it can be fun at times, and there _are_ 30 million people there, after-all ... even if some of the people there, whomst I happen to see all of the time, make the timeline unpleasant

But I'm really curious how in the world they can claim to be billionaire proof

What's stopping a billionaire from snapping up Bluesky in an instant? It's not like the app is actually decentralized or anything
