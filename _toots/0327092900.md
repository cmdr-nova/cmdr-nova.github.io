dysphoria, trans stuff, slursI don't really know what my identity is anymore, and I've struggled for over a decade to just be comfortable with what I see in the mirror regardless of hormone therapy, or not, and I'm really close to thatBut I still have a lot of trauma and bad feelings connected to violence, and slurs, and to use "I reclaimed this" as an excuse to disconnect yourself from any responsibility for sending people into a spiral, is disgustingAnd it's the Bluesky experience
