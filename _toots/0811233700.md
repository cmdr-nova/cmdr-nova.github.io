spent the whole entire evening moving my store and second life apartment to a single parcel where it will stand now for way way way way less money than the sim was costing mewhich is greatbut man I wish Linden Labs charged normal server prices?Like I can have a Minecraft server for 9 bucks a month but Second Life charges 100
