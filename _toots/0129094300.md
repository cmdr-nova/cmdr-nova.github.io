Anyway, today I should decide what I want to do fediverse-wise. I enjoy running my own instance, and I've been doing so because I find it hard to trust random moderators/admins on other instances (in that, how do I know they won't take personal issue with something I post and then nuke my entire account, as has happened numerous times now)But also, I don't think I should be spending nearly 70 dollars a month just to post stuff online. I think I should focus on maintaining my website, and have fedi not be a thing that costs me a ton of money ðŸ˜‚
