Someone on Reddit arguing with me that Second Life creators should make their creations modifiable by default because the opposite means their work is more likely to be ripped off and stolen I don’t know, this is where I have a divided opinion amongst some people in SLVirtual customers saying they’re more likely to steal and ripoff if they can’t do what they want with something they’ve purchased doesn’t put any fault at the feet of the creator It just means people suck
