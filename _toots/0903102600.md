things i've mastered and things i find impossibleI've spent years learning and mastering web development, blender, fl studio, and all kinds of software, and I've still got more to learnbut one thing I find impossible to even learn is, how to build a community lol I don't know if I need to tone police myself, or advertise daily that I have a discord and a mastodon instance that you can just join if you want  ,  or if I need to cut out the financial aspects, like, obviously part of building a community is because I have things I want to share that also sometimes cost moneyI don't know. I did it ONE time on a trans community discord and then that was completely destroyed by L Bailey
