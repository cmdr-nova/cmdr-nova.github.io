I briefly (and maybe still am) considered figuring out how to dual boot Windows 11 on this system so I can play Dragon's Dogma 2Game cost 70 dollars and I can't turn it on for 10 minutes without it crashing my gpu drivers lolI mean I could just be patient and wait for Proton to fix it and NOT use up likely 100 gigs of space for Windows bloatAnd also I think on Pop_OS secure boot may be disabled?
