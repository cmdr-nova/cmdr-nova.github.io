I used to be good at building communities. Back in 2016-2017 I had a bustling trans community Discord server ... that came crashing down in-part thanks to L Bailey and her friendsEver since, it's been hit and miss. I build a city in Second Life for people to gather in and hang out at, make a new Discord, offer up even a small Minecraft server for people to join, but there's no talking, not really any hanging out. Feels like it falls entirely on me to get everything moving and I just have so many things going on I can't lol
