Now, if Primfeed (a Second Life social site designed by a resident) could give API codes, or have an RSS feed, that would be cool

But the developer behind it is more interested in having 40 ways to pay him for setting up a social site for Second Life rather than features that don't keep it a closed-off ecosystem
