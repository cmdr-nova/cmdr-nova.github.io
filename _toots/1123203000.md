Since we're using #mastodon4harris for visibility, I want to visibilize my website, the things I do, and what I offerIn 2017 I started a music project as an isolated trans woman, a project that is still ongoing, even as I struggle with what my gender identity even ishttps://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/dissolution-protocolAt the beginning of the year, I ditched wordpress, and built this site on the jekyll frameworkhttps://nova.mkultra.monsterI offer custom linkpages that you have full control over, with no monthly feeshttps://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you/I like to make shitty apps and scripts in pythonhttps://github.com/cmdr-nova?tab=repositoriesAnd you can help me be free of regular retail work by supporting what I do here: https://ko-fi.com/cmdr_nova and here: https://liberapay.com/cmdr-nova/Thanks
