It’s general knowledge I compose every single note in all of my tracks but this one especially I’m proud of because I composed the notes for a guitar and it actually sounds cool(This was supposed to be a link to the track Initiate the Protocol but I can’t fix it on mobile lol)https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/dissolution-protocol?t=6
