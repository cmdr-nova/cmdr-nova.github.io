Is anyone on [#pop_os](https://mastodon.online/tags/pop_os) or [#Ubuntu](https://mastodon.online/tags/Ubuntu) playing Monster Hunter Wilds on [#steam](https://mastodon.online/tags/steam)? Can you verify for me if they fixed the blank screen bug, or if it works? I’d like to get it but the open beta was completely borked on my system
