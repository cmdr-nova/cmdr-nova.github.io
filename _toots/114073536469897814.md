So, this is a really interesting repo

You could essentially use this to pull all of your posts on Mastodon into a folder on your website. And if you're running Jekyll, you could make it like .. a _toot folder, and then setup a Liquid format to include "toots" alongside posts, notes, logs, etc

Effectively creating a reverse feed that backs up everything you post
