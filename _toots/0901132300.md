I've decided I'm going to try some things. Cause, I'm in serious debt still, overloaded by what vets charged me 2 years ago, and I also just paid for car repairs out of pocket which slammed hard.So I'm gonna give Buffer a shot, see if it helps me actually share the work that I do, and also sub.club. Especially sub.club, because I'm seeing sentiment going around from some people on the fedi timeline calling creators trying to make money on the fediverse "commercial" or "corporate"I love almost nothing more than sticking it to rich tech dudes who think poor people making money on the fediverse is bad
