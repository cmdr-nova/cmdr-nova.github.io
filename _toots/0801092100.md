I see people say stuff like this on other social media sometimes and I dunno maybe I just don’t get the issueYeah you’re not gonna be an influencer on mastodon, and nobody’s gonna pay you for having views on your posts, and yeah, you gotta put a little thought into the server you pick Is that really so much of a hard pass that ppl would rather be exploited by algorithms and learning models lol
