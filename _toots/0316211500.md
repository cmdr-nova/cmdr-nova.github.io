Create a Bootable Debian Flash DriveIn my last post, I suggested you, the reader, abandon Windows, jump ship, get out while you still can, and dive directly into Debian. What I didn't talk about, was how to create a bootable flash drive so that you can install it! This is, of course, sparsely detailed on the Debian Wiki itself, and maybe across many different websites.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/17/create-a-bootable-debian-flash-drive/
