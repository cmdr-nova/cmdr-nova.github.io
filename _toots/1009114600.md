It was 7:30 in the morning, had just gotten to work, and was slogging through the routine feeling a bit extra tiredThen, like out of that pretend-90s horror game: a customer approachedHe wanted to know where a pallet of merchandise went that he wanted to buy stuff from. I told him I honestly didn’t know because I hadn’t been here yesterday. He asks me there’s anyone who does, and me, knowing that both people who would know are off, I say nah, unfortunately not.Dude about launches into a tirade about “of COURSE not, shouldn’t expect customer service at [big box store], thanks for the HELP”I mean it when I say this, but we need technology that lets you mute people in person 😂
