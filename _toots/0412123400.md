One of the reasons I’m choosing to federate with Threads (because this is an ongoing war, and some people only think in black and white terms), is because there are trans people there, there are other LGBTQI ppl there, there are cool people on ThreadsAnd if they can see that Mastodon is cooler, by having an open window to itThen good? Haha maybe more will come here? I mean I thought that was the goal
