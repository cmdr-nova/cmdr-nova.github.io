managed to get my footer on my website back to the bottom of the page where it belongs, but on mobile it's like 2 inches long, not spanning the whole screen and then the repeating, fixed page background is no longer repeating lolsecretly starting to hate spending hours optimizing the look of my website for mobile while it looks completely fine on desktop
