I mean, I guess my website IS sorta *fake* federated, in that I have a feed of my posts on a sidebar, and I have Mastodon comments on every post (which will persist permanently until I decide to delete old posts, if I ever have to), and then I have my python scripts posting my blog posts on here automatically (even tho the rss feed messes up the links if i happen to post between 10pm and midnight)
