mastodon needs the "hide for everyone" feature for replies to your posts, and even replies to your comments on other people's posts lolif there's anything to take away from Threads, it's completely controlling your social experiences as a user and vaporizing trolls and assholes directly into the nether as if they'd never spoken in the first place
