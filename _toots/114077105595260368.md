alright, now I have a cronjob on my local machine that grabs any new toots I've posted here, everyday, at 2am, and converts them to markdown files in a folder on my website

Now I just have to figure out how to display them on the site (which shouldn't be too hard, because setting up Golang was a massive pain in the ass lol)
