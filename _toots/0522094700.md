Yes, this means you can't play Valorant, because Linux ain't gonna let some dev studio install anticheat in the kernal or whateverYou also can't play Fornite, because the CEO is a douchebagBut these are VERY FEW trade-offs, to also have access to mostly almost EVERYTHING elseCyberpunk 2077, Counterstrike 2, Death Stranding, Apex Legends, Dragon's Dogma 2, etc
