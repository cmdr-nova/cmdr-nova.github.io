Trying to make a little extra money this week : Do you or anyone you know have a lot of links? Don't wanna pay indefinitely for simple features, such as having an avatar, or a background image?Want something built custom, for you, and hosted on Neocities?Look no further friend, khajeet has wares, at LinkGarden!https://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you/Starts at 80 USD (larger packages available with extended options)#website #webdev #custompage-----I've made this as a response to the ever-enshittening internet, where all fun or useful things are a subscription. This is a rejection to subscriptions, and it encourages you to dig into code and learn (if you should like, I can also make further edits at a later time via your request)
