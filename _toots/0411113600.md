I have the original spot that my store was on in #secondlife saved in a landmark, and the guy who stole it from me when I moved locations has been there for 6 years. this past week he went overdue on the rental, at which point I figured "Yes! I can get my spot back as soon as they kick him out!"Come back to find the rent fully paidmfer
