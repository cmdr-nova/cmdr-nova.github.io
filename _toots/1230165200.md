also on my vacation, I also want to decide, before I accept any new members here, if I want to keep running a Mastodon instance (and therefore paying for one), or if I want to find a fedi space that I like (that won't ban me for telling a troll to go fuck himself) where I can post to fedi and not be paying for itI don't knowI like owning my space, but my credit card bills are endless and never seem to get any lower
