Self harm, suicide mention, true “crime” podcasts etcSo many of these stories I hear where someone ended their life, or presumably did, there’s a lot of speculation of foul playBut honestly the “there’s no way, they didn’t show any sign, they were happy”As someone who deals with mountains of internal turmoil I rarely speak about, that’s kinda how it happens
