Actually, I think third person for this book will work just fine. I'm re-reading the opening that I wrote ... over a year ago at this point, below this CWOh man, what the HELL was I going to write next in this chapter? haha---“Strap yourselves in, ya frosty ass SPUs, get those trigger fingers ready.” A man fully suited up in black as the void armor spun around, hand on a cord in the cargo bay of a small planet-jumper vessel, “You get the team in, you get to the priority package, and then you get the fuck out!”The six of them all lined the starboard side of the interior, view-ports looking out upon Venus in their approach to the once-previously super-heated planet.“Penal colony TeraCom nine is no joke! This ain’t a training simulation! You get caught, you fuck up, you’re all dead!”
