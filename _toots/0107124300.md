Thing is, you can have all the standards you want to say that you have, but if the line is drawn at federating with Meta, and then stops right there and never thinks critically or analyzes bad behavior from INSIDE the fediverseI don't believe youI don't think you actually care about anyone or stopping bad behavior from within these walls
