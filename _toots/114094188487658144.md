I see people talking about how much they can't wait for the [#LadyBird](https://mastodon.online/tags/LadyBird) browser, so I figured it necessary to dig up a post I wrote on my website a year ago about some transphobia kicked up by Andreas Kling and why you shouldn't bother with it, ever

TL;DR: Dude is a neo nazi, and he forked LadyBird in a tantrum because people kept asking him why he wrote code that misgendered its users.
