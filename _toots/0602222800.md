So, I've basically been experimenting with Threads. Let's say, using myself as a human Guinea pig so that I can "report" on things for people who refuse to use itConsider me, informing you: If you don't suspend, or limit Threads, it will be like having Twitter viewing posts coming out of your instance. You will be blocking, muting, suspending people, a lot. Every day.
