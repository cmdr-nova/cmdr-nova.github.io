Still absolutely zero correspondence from tumblr irt my accountI realize I probably won’t get it back, but it’s really unprofessional to just nuke someone’s account without corresponding anything I have an account on Threads with half a million views and thousands of likes and shares on a post irt Luigi Mangione and my account is fine How is meta better than tumblr
