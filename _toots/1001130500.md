Kinda sad I had to block someone because they saw me in an argument with someone and called it harassment, even though I was mostly just explaining how calling generative AI a "tool" is a red flag, and the person talking at me screenshotted the definition of "tool" as if that meant something in our back and forthBeing angry and explaining how your argument doesn't make sense is not harassment
