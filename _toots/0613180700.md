I'm sure people see me on my instance doing a lot of anti-AI talk, even directly opposing even miniscule instances of itI don't know if this is annoying to some, but it's what I feel is required in order to maintain some semblance of an internet space that isn't overrun with sludgeI like to think of it as if I'm holding up a lawn mower in front of me and just running through a field of 10 foot grass that's shaped like garbage
