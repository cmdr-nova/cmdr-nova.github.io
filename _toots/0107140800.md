This is probably the 4th or 5th time I've spoken about the behavior of people over at h.t, and it'll probably be the last time.I tire of speaking of bad things that people have done to me and nothing ever happening. Nobody ever apologizes, nobody ever speaks, nobody ever answers for any of the things they've done.It's a trend, it's trendy, and it's annoying
