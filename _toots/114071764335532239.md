I _am_ interested in finding out if people who subscribe to my RSS feed through a reader, or e-mail client, experience any repeated notifications of posts they were already notified of

I _thought_ I fixed this issue, and I might have, but I have no way of knowing for sure even though I monitor my own feed through Vivaldi's feed subscription interface
