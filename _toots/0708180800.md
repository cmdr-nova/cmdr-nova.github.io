As bad as the NFT scene is, and having unfortunate personal experience with it, I gotta say I feel like AI is even worse lolNon fungible tokens were admittedly a ridiculous idea but I guess at least they weren’t scraping the entire internet to destroy human creativity as we know it haha… even though I legit believe AI arose from NFT bros who wanted to easily generate thousands of tokens (which they definitely did and still do)
