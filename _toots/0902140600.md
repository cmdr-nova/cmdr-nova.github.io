I was reading some faq on github pages and they actually prohibit the sale of items, or making money on github pages whatsoeverso kind of the attitude you'd expect from foss, "making money bad, unless you work for us"meaning, obviously i should probably stick to neocities as my host, but goddang the CLI needs a way to specific exactly WHAT to upload, rather than overwriting the entire website over and over
