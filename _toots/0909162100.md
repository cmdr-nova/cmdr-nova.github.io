I see a lot of people commenting on cohost’s closure notice saying things like “this was the only place I could express myself or feel safe”I cannot stress this enough, make a website, put it on a free hosting service and enjoy the ability to do whatever you want, without harassment, and about 9000% less server cost (free)
