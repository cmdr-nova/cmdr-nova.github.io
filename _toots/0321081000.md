I keep seeing this "#fedipact" thing jump onto my timeline, people trying to aggressively pressure other instances into "joining it" in order to signify meta is blocked on their instancesThe thing largely seems like an ego booster and someone who wants to have imaginary power over othersI say, just block meta yourself and don't worry about instances threatening to limit and suspend you if you don't join their cult-pact
