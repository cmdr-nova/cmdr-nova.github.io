Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsWebsite, I Command You, Be Responsive!https://nova.mkultra.monster/programming/2024/10/27/website-i-command-you-be-responsive.htmlToday, I got home from work, and for once wasn’t feeling too tired to even type on my keyboard. So, I logged into Second Life and acquired some land, and noticed I could hold a little more. I shot off a ticket to Linden Labs and asked for some more space, because … I’d like to build things. While I sat waiting for a response to this ticket (which I’m still waiting on) I did what any normal person would do. I fully redesigned the way my website responds to different screens.
