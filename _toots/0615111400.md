I've actually been thinking about this a lot, and not really because of unoriginal dudes on instagram using ai to write text for them, but mostly because I look at how people are showing or advertising their content and they make specific accounts and pages with JUST their music, or whatevernothing else.In 2024 I'm not so sure that's the way to bring in attention anymore
