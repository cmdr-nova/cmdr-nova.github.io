Mastodon's internal administration system warns against letting trending hashtags just come in on their own without prior approval (this is a daily thing that you have to do constantly), but I've had approval turned off for like 3 months and I've yet to find anything bad trendingProbably because I moderate the absolute hell out of strangers and bad instances that pop up lol
