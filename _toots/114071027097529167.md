My website links here on Mastodon keep referencing my bot over on mastodon.social as the verified creator, instead of this account, which I've made sure is referenced in the HTML on my site

So either the fedi needs a cache update, or I'm missing a verified creator code laying around somewhere on my site that's referencing the wrong account
