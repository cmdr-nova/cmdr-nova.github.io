love my little m1 macbook that can run my browser, vs code, and second life at once with only slight degredation in performanceof course, my linux machine is powerful enough to do more than that, but it just goes to show you don't need to buy every iteration of macbook as they're releaseda COOL christmas gift tho, would be an m4 (m3?) macbook hahabut ain't not no one gonna spend 1500 bucks on me
