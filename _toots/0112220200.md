Zuck got one thing right: Apple hasn't technically invented anythingThe thing(s) he got wrong (aside from all of the other things he's said since the beginning of the year), is that Apple _is_ responsible for the smartphone every single person is holding in their hands. Apple is the reason tablets took off (even though these things technically existed as far back as the 80s), and although Apple didn't _invent_ the smartwatch, they're the reason anyone even wanted one.SoZuck just continues this weird Meta vs. Apple grudge that nobody understands
