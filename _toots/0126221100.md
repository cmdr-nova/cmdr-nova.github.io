like, imagine a story where a bunch of people are on a ship out in deep space, and their mission is to discover new life, and new planets, but something goes wrong with their systems and just as they're approaching this planet they've never seen before, the whole thing malfunctions and becomes a smoldering bullet in the sky of said planet, and down below is a whole species of dinosaur and then the end of the story is the beginning of new life on earth*inception sound*
