Was maybe being followed on the way home from workSo, I'm 99.9% certain someone was following me on my way home from workI'm driving like usual, turning down the road that goes to the other road that eventually leads to where I liveI pull up to a traffic light and I notice out of the blue, this dude in a black car is right on my bumperLight turns green, so I go, and like I do, I indicate and merge into the right lane, cause that's where I wanna be. Guy behind me does this creeping slow merge into my lane without any signaling.Okay, weirdFurther down the road, still behind me. I turn onto the back road that leads home, guy also turnsGetting this overwhelming sense that I might be being followed. Question is, why would a random stranger follow me?I don't take any chances. I gunned it through a yellow light and lost him, turned into the development where I live, parked, and flipped off all the lightsSa'll good now, I think? lol
