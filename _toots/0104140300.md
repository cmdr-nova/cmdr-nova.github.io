Trying to figure out how I can reduce the cost of this instance, and/or considering moving to another as a userI really want to keep mkultra.monster, and continue posting in a way that I can control how people interact with me, and not accidentally join an instance with overzealous admins/modsBut also this is costing like 50-60 a month, primarily because of the addition of elastic search and backups lol
