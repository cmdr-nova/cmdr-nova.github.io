I moved my #secondlife business to a parcel that runs along Route 12 (a linden labs protected road), and noticed there were smaller pieces of land for sale, okayeach piece of land gives me a little more space to work with where my store's at, and I noticed one of the parcels for sale had someone's store on itso, like a ruthless business person, I bought the land and deleted this stranger's store ğŸ˜‚ ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
