was reading an article about indie studios who are now using AI, because "abloobloobloo we can't afford artists"I said it on Threads and I'll say it here for the people who don't want to use ThreadsIf you can't pay employees, you shouldn't be in business. Just because you have an idea, doesn't mean it deserves to exist at the expense of everyone around you.
