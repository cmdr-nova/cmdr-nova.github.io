I don’t think I’ve talked about this situation a whole lot tho, but it was damn terrifying I was using what little money I had to buy cigarettes, driving someone else’s car, and seconds before I closed the door to the vehicle this man (while shouting slurs) was rushing for the doorI slammed on the gas and got out of there, but I don’t think I ever really processed it
