It sucks a lot though, because after I was wrongfully banned from hackers.town a year ago, and after I had people dogpiling me on Bluesky for asking them to CW the slur "tr*nny", I went to Threads as a brand new platform. I made a handful of friends and I found a place where things could actually be kind of nice, instead of constantly rude and vitriolicYou, know, but then I kind of yearned for the inguinity of launching and running my own Mastodon instance, and returned to thatAnd you might be thinking like "wait, Threads was nice?"it WAS!Not anymore, not if billionaire dickheads have anything to do with it
