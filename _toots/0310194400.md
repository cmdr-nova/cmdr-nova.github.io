so, I can get a frankly super beefy popOS pc off system76 for 1599 (which I think is discounted) :: 1 tb ssd, 64 gigs of ram (WHAT??!?), an 8 gig amd gpu (not bad, that is at least passable)my question is: anyone out here using popOS? is it cool? would I like it as someone who'se been using debian 12
