These studios lately, CDPR saying 2077 is done, no more DLC, when there could be so much moreBlizzard calling Diablo 4 a game that you won't play forever, kind of killing its staying powerNow Larian saying they're never making another Baldur's GateIt'd be like if BioWare made Mass Effect 1 and said "Nah, there's no need for any more of that"
