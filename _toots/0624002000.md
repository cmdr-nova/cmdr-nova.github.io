Cyberpunk 2077, something I never understood from Johnny's perspectivespeaking of 2077, I never understood exactly how the events of Johnny bombing Arasaka tower unfoldedFirst you're in a helicopter gunning people down on the roof, then you're inside and setting up the bomb in an elevator that presumably detonates when it hits the first floor.Johnny stays behind and fights Adam Smasher, all the while this bomb is still presumably going down to the ground ...Flash forward and Johnny is at ground level on a stretcher in front of the building, still not explodedFlash forward again and Johnny is apprehended miles and miles away from the explosion that has finally happenedJust how tall is that building???
