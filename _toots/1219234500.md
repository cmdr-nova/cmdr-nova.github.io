I'm re-reading the opening that I wrote ... over a year ago at this point, below this CWWhat was I smoking when I wrote this---“Today we’ve accomplished the impossible.” His drink canister tapped against the granite white desk in front of him, “And tomorrow, we deliver infinity.”After much needed and perhaps deserved celebration, they began to collect their things, ready for a night stuck in virtual chambers, at ease, in rest. It truly was the impossible that they had accomplished, but they hadn’t known yet the cost.
