linden labs, transphobia?saw someone on bsky say linden labs is banning trans people who use avatars with flat chests in SL, and of course i'm not going to challenge that on bluesky because ppl on bsky are twitter users who like to dogpile pplbut, as someone who came out as trans, created an identity for myself in second life, and then went back into the closet for the time being, still in second life, 13 years laterI and many others I know aren't banned? I think I need to see these avatars
