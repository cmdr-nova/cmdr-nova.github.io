Sex talk, self harm talkI doubt I’ll use a blog post to write about it but like my first poly experience was 2 years dating someone who had another gf, and then one day we slept together at her place and before I left to go home she said I wasn’t dating material and we stopped speaking lol Not abusive but all-around shitty, to just throw someone away after 2 years for no apparent reason, which made the whole experience feel detached, superficial, fakeTWO YEARS
