Kind of dissapointed by this video lolGuy bought an Intel Celeron 450 for a penny, a processor from 2008, proceeds to install a version of Windows on it that is much, much newer, and then tries to play GTA5 ... a game that came out in 2013I'm only 8 and a half minutes in but bro, with a chip like that, and a whole system you've got to run it, why was Windows the first choice? (hello? linux?) and you're benchmarking it with a game that would be completely obviously unplayable ðŸ˜‚ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3NK2BFs2f0
