I see the Linux fox guy is out here posting random words that come to mind he thinks people will agree with like “of course people don’t hate rich people, they only hate billionaires”Binch I do, I hate the richI don’t wanna be rich, I wanna be stable enough to have a place to live that isn’t my family’s home
