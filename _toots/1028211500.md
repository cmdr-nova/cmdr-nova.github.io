Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsGuild Wars 2, I’ve Returned!https://nova.mkultra.monster/gaming/2024/10/29/guild-wars-2-i-ve-returned.htmlIt’s been years since I’ve seriously played Guild Wars 2 in a way that constitutes actually completing content, and leveling up. In fact, I haven’t really played it much since the years that I spent outside of the traditional work-force. And that was back around Path of Fire, and now there’s at least three expansions I’ve missed, and need to catch up on. So I logged the heck on.
