the ceo of spotify thinks it costs zero dollars to make some musiceven if you're like me almost only using FL studio, the base FL costs 70 dollars, and then the computer you're putting it on costs 1000-2000, and then plugins (if you go legit) cost 50-600 dollarsAnd then it also costs monumentally huge amounts of your timeI spent 8 years learning how to make stuff that sounds good SOMETIMES
