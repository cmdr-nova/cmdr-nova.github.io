What if a Python script fetches Jekyll posts from your links as they're created when you post them (via a VPS), and converts them into statuses that are then posted via an "actor" on Mastodon over the ActivityPub protocol using Nginx and FlaskWould that really be any different than the script I have running that just posts the newest items in my RSS feed lol
