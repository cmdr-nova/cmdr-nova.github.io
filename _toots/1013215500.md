i missed playing CoD when i have nothing else I wanna do, and at this point it's like one of those guilty pleasures that you're not supposed to enjoy, but you do anywayI've decided that as soon as this game works on Linux I'm putting Pop_OS or Debian back onto this system full time, I gotta have my senseless violence and I'm not going to pay Microsoft for Gamepass on an Xbox
