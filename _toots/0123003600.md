I'm in my first month of a different position at work, and the top of the store management, or manager I should say, is breathing down my neck to have things changed and/or operating more efficiently, now, while I'm still like, in the process of figuring out things lolIt kinda pisses me offIt kinda makes me want the hell out of this company even moreso than I did 3 months ago
