It looks like, if I want Jekyll's pagination to show potentially thousands of posts, toots, logs, and notes to navigate through, I need to install the v2 plugin, except that doesn't work on Github

But, if I abandoned Github and fed the generated _site directory to Neocities, it'd be fine

But also, Neocities doesn't have a quick seamless way to upload your site (I've tried doing it manually from my hdd before, with the site mounted)
