I have to figure out if I'm going to keep paying for my homestead in Second Life, or finally shut it down, save my money, and move my store to a static parcelMy discord bot says there are people constantly visiting, but even if it's only 100 bucks a month (I shouldn't say only, that's still freakin expensive), I'm not making even 1% of that backSince I began trying to make some kind of financial freedom or income stream from Second Life, despite all I've learned and everything I've done, it's ALWAYS been ... at a loss, it's never been "profitable"
