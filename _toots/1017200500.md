Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsHeavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, Comin’ At You?https://nova.mkultra.monster/gaming/2024/10/17/heavy-metal-f-a-k-k-2-comin-at-you.htmlWhile I’m on this kick of looking back over the years at old games that are still mega-popular, I also want to look at games that maybe nobody remembers, or even knows about. No, I’m not talking about Daikatana. That game is pretty cool, and I’m pretty sure it’s also very well known. I’m talking about Julie and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, a game that came, then said, “Hey!” and subsequently vanished into the ether of game development … seemingly, forever.
