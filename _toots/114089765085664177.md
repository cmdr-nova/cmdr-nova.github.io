Well, finally got my dog back in [#KingdomCome2](https://mastodon.online/tags/KingdomCome2) after fighting like 4 wolves at once, ending with like 2 percent health? And then ran for mile and miles to run into another pack of wolves attacking someone, and nearly died there

I feel like there are a lot of wolves in KC2
