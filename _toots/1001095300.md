youtube keeps thinking i want to watch the WAN show (LTT) because i have it on all the time, but the only reason I have it on all the time is because Youtube keeps auto-playing it while I'm asleep, and then the algorithm on the website itself starts thinking because it autoplays every morning, I _must_ want to watch it lol
