`Apparently I owed 100 bucks in taxes to the state, so they sent me a threat saying that if I don't pay them by the beginning of next month they'd garnish my wages lol... for 100 bucksanyway, this kind of thing would be avoidable if mistakes during tax season were avoidablenow I gotta find a way to make 100 bucks cause I wasn't factoring paying the state what is essentially now just lost money
