Today on Nova Prime ... #blogging #tech #socialmedia #thoughtsCORS Light, The Drink of the APIhttps://nova.mkultra.monster/programming/2024/11/05/cors-light-the-drink-of-the-api.htmlI’m a little bit delirious. Last night I fell asleep on my couch the entire night, and then woke up at 6am to my cat begging for food, and then I stayed up, and went to work. I got home, and yes, instead of watching the new Deadpool, I switch on the code machine and thought, “Why am I routing the Tumblr API through a github secret only to get static results that don’t update unless I push changes to my site? The heck?” And I thought, “What if I just use a proxy server on my VPS that the JavaScript accesses to give a fresh perspective every time someone refreshes my site?” Boy … oh boy.
