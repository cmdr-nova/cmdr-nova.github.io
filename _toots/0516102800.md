it's been brought to my attention that mastodon.art is using and apparently also sharing their instance blocklist, which is largely consisted of: personal grudges, transphobia, anti-anarchismregular reminder that you should never, ever trust someone else's blocklist (and this is also why bluesky and its 'user moderation' methods are bad)
