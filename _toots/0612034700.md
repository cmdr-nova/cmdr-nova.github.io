In the age of AI, I feel like the topic of piracy just got more complicated. I think taking from corporations, especially corporations who are making it increasingly harder and harder to actually own anything, or those that don't pay anyone and essentially embezzle, is always correctBut when it comes to independent artists, creators, etc, it is always better to just ask if you can't afford their work
