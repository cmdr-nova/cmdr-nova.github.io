This is the house I lived in when I was 16I don't know if it's possible to detect negative or supernatural energy through a photo, but I remember one time my family and I were leaving and we could see the faces of occupants who passed standing in that glass doorway. Also in the sunroom window.If I had the money for this place, I would repaint it, fix the foundation
