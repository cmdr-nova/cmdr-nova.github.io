I don't know if it's gonna work out with this second life wife lol over the past 10 years i've kind of developed a need to not talk, and not do things i don't wanna do when i'm not at work, and the not talking part upsets herbut i just don't want to interact with people, and if this extends to be i'm close to then I guess I"ll just have to not be with people lol
