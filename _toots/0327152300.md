But through Threads, funnily enough, I started relearning how to just talk to people instead of trying to get follows at all timesAnd it made social media more fun to use, although, I’m finding out some are just not ready to go back to using social media to be social … if the way some ppl react to me speaking to them is anything to go by lol
