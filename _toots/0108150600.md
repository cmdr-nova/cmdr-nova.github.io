Now in the navigation menu of my website, you can find my 3-point fediverse tips section, detailing how to find an instance, what to look for before you join one, what you need to setup, what to do if you want to move, and how to treat the network over-all.(as of right now, these tips are specific to Mastodon)All of this, to hopefully answer some of these constant repeating questions and issues that non-users seem to talk about _all of the time_.https://nova.mkultra.monster/pages/feditips/#mastodon #fediverse #tips #feditips
