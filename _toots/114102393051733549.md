So, Ubisoft Connect updated about 2 weeks ago, and stopped working on Lutris completely, saying something like "this is no longer compatible with your system"

I had pretty much given up on it, until just now when I thought, "Hold up, what's it say in Wine configuration?"

So anyway, it works now. Lutris had Wine set to Windows XP
