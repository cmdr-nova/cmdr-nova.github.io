LGR does really great retro content, and I love when he does that stuffBut as far as his Sims content goes for the past couple years, it's pretty obvious that he just doesn't like it at all, and I haven't watched this video yet, but in-general I'm not sure why anyone would like a potential Sims 5 if they hate Sims 4
