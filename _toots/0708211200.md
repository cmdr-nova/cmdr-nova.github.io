man what's with tiktok/reels creators sucking ass in their content lately lolfirst it's one i see pretty frequently making a CSA/incest joke, and now this other one mocking killing a jumping spider because "bro they don't have feelings hope that helps"yes they do, jumping spiders DREAMjust cause something's tiny doesn't mean it's absent of thoughtlike there's literally 2 spiders in the US that can seriously harm you and a hospital visit fixes it, I don't get being scared of little spiders lol
