kinda sad I for real have to get rid of my second life sim (the city I built)months and months of building and designing, a place that was completely mine, that i could use as I wish, especially as a place for my storegone in a few dayscourse I could bring it back in a couple months as long as linden labs doesn't delete it from their database, but it would also be great if they charged normal server prices rather than 120 dollars a month
