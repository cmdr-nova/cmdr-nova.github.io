Mercury must be in a tardigrade or somethingI’m walking across the sales floor with a full pallet, this customer stops me and asks “hey do you work electronics” and I say “I don’t but what do you need?” And he goes “what do you MEAN what do I need???”So I call for someone to come help him and he repeats “what do I NEED??” I gave him a weird look and walked off lol
