Chapter 1.2 / A Routine Assignmentthis story, though, has been sitting in side of my brain for so long, that once it's all finally out, i don't even know if there's going to be anything to _take away_ from the storyi don't even know WHO the bad guy isI had this idea for some gravitational beings who exist on a dimensional plane higher than the 3rd dimension. a species that is murderous and hell-bent on eradicating the human species after their accidental erasure of most of the universebut also the human species, in this story, is governed by a fascist Authority, so they're kind of ALSO bad guys
