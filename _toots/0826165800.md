I'm writing a new post for my website about my instance and things going on with it, and this is definitely going to be in itbut how come nobody at veganism.social asked permission if they could scrape all this information about whether or not servers are federating with Threads, and how come nobody has challenged that? lolhttps://fedipact.veganism.social/Not that I won't say "I am soft-federating with Threads based on some goals I have", but if we're going to come down on tech-bros randomly deciding to scrape millions of servers, this shouldn't be an exception to that rule
