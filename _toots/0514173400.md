Randomly remembering a time in the 2nd grade our teacher asked if any of us could spell “vagina” and this kid, we’ll say his name was Chris, raised his hand and started spelling “Virginia”I piped up and said that was wrong, but the teacher interrupted me and said “no, he’s right. Keep going, Chris”Ever since, that situation has haunted me … for some reason lol
