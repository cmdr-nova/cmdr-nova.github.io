How do you go about becoming a professional writerIm almost sure I could write less depressing things than Joan Westenberg like “don’t bother trying to make a good content, you have to be famous before you do that”Coming from doing things like writing and music and so on for years and years, yeah I mean that’s kinda true. Grabbing attention for your work is like Dark Souls, but I don’t need a reminder lol
