I know it's cringe mostly for most people to say "Breaking Bad is one of my fave shows" but after BB and BCS and El Camino, there is just one thread that could easily be a return series, or a second movieAnd I'm THAT nostalgic for the past 10 years that I would definitely watch a show or movie about a detective who has found a lead on Jessie Pinkman's whereabouts
