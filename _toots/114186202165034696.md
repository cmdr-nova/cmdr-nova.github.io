End of Dragons is a pretty good expansion so far, altho, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed, because the only content I've actually completed on any character in the past decade was the origin story and the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire expansions lol

There is SO MUCH my character needs to do, and even more since I switched to a Necromancer
