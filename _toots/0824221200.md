I'm trying to find the old Windows 95 install videos, and all youtube wants to give me is the Friends related stuffBut i'm talking about the videos embedded in the installation, where there was like a mime or a clown acting things out or being weird on-screen as you clicked through thingsI know this exist because I remember it, but I'm nearly convinced it's just lost media now
