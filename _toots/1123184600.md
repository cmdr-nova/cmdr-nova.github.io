Keep seeing people say things like “Mastodon is a pointless endeavor where you’ll never reach a real audience” or “Bluesky is a ticking time bomb and must be opposed at all costs” I can say that Mastodon has been one of the only places I’ve ever had any real support for the things I do. I can’t say the same for Twitter back when I was making music much more frequently. I was tolerated in that scene for who I was, and ejected when I became inconvenient. And I can also say starting from zero on Bluesky trying to make people care about what I do for a 3rd or 4th time online is just ... well it seems more pointless than mastodon
