Would it be plausible to setup a gofundme asking for help to pay off the debt I incurred a year and a half ago when I had to put my cat to sleep and got charged nearly 4000 dollars (that I'm still paying on, with no end in sight)?This is one of the major things keeping me from being able to rent an apartment (as overpriced as many of them are)
