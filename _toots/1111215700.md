Today on Nova Prime: https://nova.mkultra.monster/linux/2024/11/11/ten-months-without-windows.htmlI’m sitting here a little more tired than I’d like to be, but that’s the life of working a manual labor day job, and code-jacking at night (what the hell is code-jacking). Today I want to sort of look back over the past year, and reflect on what it’s been like to mostly abandon Windows (with a slight hiccup of returning for a week).#linux
