The most unbelievable part of some of this Backrooms fan content on Youtube is that if you get lost in the backrooms/complex for multiple days, you aren't going to suddenly escape feeling fineyou're gonna be starvingin fact, a lot of the backrooms fan content doesn't seem to ever go "hey people would die in here pretty quickly cause it's just rooms and there's no food or water"
