you know, I've had the portable SSD plugged into both my Macbook and Debian machine, and on the Macbook, there's some issue with it where it causes beachballing any time the system tries to directly access itlol I wonder if having that plugged into Debian is why the system was freezingthe portable SSD is corrupt and it was the culprit? maybe???
