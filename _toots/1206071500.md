Trying to get in early on #BandcampFriday I've got lots of bills, also got charged 100 bucks for another bill I didn't even know I owedI have 20+ releases under #Eyeshadow2600FM, which started in 2017 while I was pretty isolated and suffering from mental health issues. In 2020 I had a bestseller on #darksynth Bandcamp (Ride Eternal)Link: https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.comI also now have a secondary music project where I've been working on my next album, 'disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX', which I may finally have a new track for soon! I also put it up for preorder WAY early thinking I would have it done, but work has been draining and eating all of my time.Either way, that's here: https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux#vaporwave #synthwave #bandcamp #music
