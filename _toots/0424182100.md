Gotta admit I don’t like tik tok cause I just mostly find it annoying and a social media app where you HAVE to post a video is a terrible way to exclude people who don’t wanna do that lolBut it’s also unconstitutional to ban it and is actually exactly what the first amendment is about, contrary to what nazis thought it meant
