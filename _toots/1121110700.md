Mastodon for sure has its issues, like larger instances that don't properly moderate anything and whatnotBut on other social media, that's not even what people are concerned about when complaining about the signup and usage process of MastodonIt's always, "I don't like how I have to pick a community, and that there are some unwritten rules about tagging certain topics, like politics"Like from the inside looking out, it seems the biggest problem from people who refuse to consider the platform, is that they have to think about other people when they do things. And I can't emphasize enough how much that mindset resonates with your typical influencer, and influencer-wannabes
