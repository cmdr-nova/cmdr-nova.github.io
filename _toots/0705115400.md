In the past 3 or 4 months that I've been paying for Mastodon hosting on toot.io, they've somehow managed to keep my instance's media storage at or around 17 gigs, no matter how many instances and people I federate withI think it's safe to say federation here has reached into at the very least the couple hundred thousandI definitely think mkultra.monster can exist for a long time
