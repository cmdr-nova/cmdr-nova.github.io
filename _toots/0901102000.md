Like, obviously Mastodon was not the first piece of software to connect over ActivityPub, and I'm at least 99% certain nobody involved in developing it has ever spoken like they were the firstBut then I go on Bluesky and the devs just have this air about them, like they feel that none of this has been done before, and they're the first to break away from the iron grip of sites like TwitterIt just makes me not want to use the site, but more aggressively (even though this post will go to Bluesky lol)
