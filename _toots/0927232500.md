huh, well, viewing the open positions at Automattic, while not a place I think I want to work for no matter how desperate I am to finally break into a tech field (I am not working for Matt "Hammers' Mullenweg)I did glance their applications and they suggest listing projects you've contributed to, like open source stuffThat's a great ideaI should contribute to stuff on github and then add it to my resume
