The Classrooms looks like a cool liminal (backrooms-ish) game, but despite Insym loving it, I feel like it misses the point of liminal horrorLiminal horror isn't about being constantly stalked by entitiesIt's about the horror of unfamiliarity in endless space where living causes anxiety, and _sometimes_ produces an entity based on your own fears, paranoia, and possibly delusions
