the only time i've had a bad time on mastodon is when admins and moderators don't do their jobs correctly, and i have unfortunately had to abandon like 4 or 5 different instances since 2017 because of thatbut when you're in a place where admins/mods aren't running a cult, or doing their jobs correctly, there are no issues
