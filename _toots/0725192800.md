I decided to try adding utterances as a comment section on my posts on the website and i'm 80% successful lolit puts the comment box on every post, but the post itself on each post, is gone ðŸ˜‚ i'm sure there's an element i'm missing in the "post.html" layout that puts the text of a post back where it belongs
