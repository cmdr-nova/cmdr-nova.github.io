I mean I hardly understand quantum physics, but if your CPU is doing something in minutes that would've taken an older chip 1 septillion years to complete, then you're very actually messing with spacetimeThat's got to be faster than the speed of light or somethingYou're breaking the laws of physicsI don't believe Google is doing that
