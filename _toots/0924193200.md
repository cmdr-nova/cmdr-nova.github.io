fedi metalook, I don't really know how I feel about VantaI think creating a campaign to use peer pressure to get other instances to block Threads is weird, because I feel like instances should be able to choose for themselves what they wanna do, because ... it doesn't affect youBut I agree with a lot of other things Vanta says or does, and the only thing Ginny's ever done is exactly what she's criticizing in this post, and she also booted me off of her old instance when I was having a severe mental breakdown back when I was still heavily isolated and being abusedSo take that for what you will
