All my life I've been a "learn as you go" type of coder. Wouldn't call myself an expert in anything, not even the stuff I've been doing since high schoolBut I'm like, "okay google where do i start if i wanna make some cash with code right now" and it f*ckin recommends fiverr hahawhich is where i literally have myself, ready to hire, for anyone who wants a website, where my only messages have been from scammers trying to get my personal info
