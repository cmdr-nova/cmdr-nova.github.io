I have my criticisms of Mastodon, or in better words, the way some of the people on the fediverse think, and how they treat creators, and I definitely have huge criticisms about the venture capital behind BlueskyAnd then I see people who just have no IDEA what they're talking about ðŸ˜‚ "Mastodon is a company"
