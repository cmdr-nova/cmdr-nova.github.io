To this day, over a year since I launched an instance (before I moved over to managed hosting), people are launching new instances RIGHT NOW, and they're running into the directory permissions issue, i.e., wherein you need to do this in order for your instance to literaly function:chmod 755 /home/mastodonchmod 755 /home/mastodon/livechmod 755 /home/mastodon/live/publicI want to know WHY this is so _badly_ documented that something THIS important would be missed so often lol#mastodon
