having some dinner and watching people's thoughts on youtube in regard to Kane Pixel's 'Found Footage 3'I hope sometime there's an answer as to what the monster chasing Ravie wasI suppose it could have been the man he spoke to in the house that seemed to be able to hear him from the opposite side of the pocket dimension (the complex), but that would have to assume that the Backrooms distorts time and space (it probably does)
