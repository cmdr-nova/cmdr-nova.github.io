I do sometimes wonder if there are a bunch of instances that have me muted or not, thoughBecause recently someone told me there was some kind of callout post about me after I was banned from hackers.townBut I mean that really tracks with some people's mindsetHave a trauma related mental breakdown > get called out by people who don't take any time to investigate who they're slandering
