is it too late to return to #guildwars2 i've kinda decided i'm sick of paying for world of warcraft when i spent maybe an hour playing per week (because i do a lot of other things), and i have launch-day characters in GW2 that would be cool to return toas long as they're not gearing up to release guild wars 3 next week or something lol
