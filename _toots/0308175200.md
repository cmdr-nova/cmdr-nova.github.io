So, before I left for work, I reinstalled Discord (on Debian/Gnome) from their official .deb file instead of the flatpak (because the FP version wasn’t seeing Firestorm)And then added one of the Firestorm processes as a “game” that Discord could displayThen Firestorm/Second Life started crashing in intervalsHMMMMMMMMM
