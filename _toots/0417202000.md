There's this thing in Second Life where creators will make template mesh clothing you can buy and customize, texture, and then resell as a fully realized product, which is kind of like buying beats as a musicianAnd there are people who have a real problem with this (mostly customers and snooty SL events)But AI is spreading like the plague in Second Life and I would pose, what's the big deal with paying an artist for some pre-rigged mesh when ppl are out here using theft machines
