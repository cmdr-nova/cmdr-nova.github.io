I’ve written numerous times about what happened with Twitter synthwave, what happened with social groups here on mastodon but I haven’t ever really written about how Laurelai Bailey spent years trying to gaslight me into believing I’m a sociopath Still not sure if I should but maybe it would bring some of the people back that cut me off when she was holding me metaphorically hostage
