They should reboot Star Wars in an alternate universe where the force still exists but it’s much harder to use, and you can’t do it often. Also space travel takes time, a lot of time, and warp costs a lot of resources. Most planets are uninhabitable and a war against the freedom fighters and the empire is brutal, slow, and horrifying
