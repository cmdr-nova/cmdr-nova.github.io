I thought I would feel more sad having to shutter my SL store but, it's honestly kind of a weight off my shoulders.I just don't have the energy anymore to pay Linden Labs for in-world hosting, and the right to do so, and the ability to have groups, and the ability to do this, and to do that, and pay more feesLike, nahI'll learn Unity and become a VR Chat mogule
