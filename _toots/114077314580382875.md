Alright! Very much thanks to [@shellsharks](https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks) for pointing out this repo: [https://git.garrido.io/gabriel/mastodon-markdown-archive#installation](https://git.garrido.io/gabriel/mastodon-markdown-archive#installation)

because my website is now functionally an archive of every single thing I post here, on my Mastodon account, in reverse syndication

All I have to do is run the backup script in a cronjob once per day, and build my website whenever I feel like it

You can see my toots from here, there, now: [https://mkultra.monster](https://mkultra.monster)
