I kind of want to launch a Sharkey instance on DigitalOcean and then swap my domain over and retake full control of my own social media hostingBut I don't know how much of a monster Misskey/Sharkey is, such as, is it enough to have cloud media storage? Or are there other issues that may cause massive monthly charges accidentally
