Reading even more into the history of the chaos behind the BTTF movies, and I already knew that Crispin Glover was screwed over a bit by Zemeckis, but I didn't entirely know that Glover didn't like the end of BTTF1 because ... "it teaches people that money buys happiness"I mean, they shouldn't have used his likeness in BTTF2, but BUTmoney DOES buy happiness, you can see it all around youalso, the message at the end of BTTF was that George was confident, and put his life togetherUh, I thought it was about being confident in what you wanted to accomplish
