I think I've decided that I'm just going to concentrate on keeping what little resources I have maintaining this instanceMedia storage hasn't really gone up a whole lot since the relaunch and I think that's because it's finally evening out, and I think I've mostly solved the issues it was having with launching and then relaunching software on the same domain lol (albeit, there are still some non-Mastodon instances that seem to be having issues federating with my posts)
