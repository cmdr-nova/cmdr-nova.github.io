This new guy at work, who is essentially a kid in comparison to me (like 18 or 19), was talking about coding and webdev, and I was throwing back some stuff I know, and we were having like a real conversation about this stuffAnd somehow it got into me being like "Yeah, I started reading some beginner tutorials on Rust, and dang it really gets involved"and he says, "Yeah it's harder to learn stuf when you're older"Still thinking about that, never mentioned I was having a hard time learning ðŸ˜‚
