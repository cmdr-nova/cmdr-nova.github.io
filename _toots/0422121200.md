just made a new, larger post on my website, and it looks like the failure point (where my website would crash) was at the point of publishing and subsequent federation.I'm noticing a fair amount of website lag after posting, but so far it hasn't crashed my website. I'm going to assume this is because of the enormous amount of sudden connections
