drug talkTo each their own, and you can do what you want butI really don't understand how anyone enjoys getting highMaybe I'm built different, but I HATE how weed makes me feelI hate the tunnel vision, I hate how it makes my mind completely shut off, or how it makes me feel like I'm third personnoI'd rather be drunk and dealing with a hangover lol
