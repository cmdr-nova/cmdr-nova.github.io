neighbor spoke to the firemen outside, asked what was going on, they say "small electrical fire in the upstairs of [the house]" and then he asks "you think 13 fire trucks is a bit much for a small bit of smoke?" and fireman tells him "you never know what to expect on these calls"bro i have never seen 13 firetrucks show up for any fire, ever
