politics10 years ago I said that the republican party was done, and would likely dissolve I was wrongIt's the democratic party that's over. The party of "let's not rock the boat" and "we'll just compromise over and over"The party of no chances, no stakes, no real ideals. Just pandering and saying what you think other people want to hear, so they'll vote for you.And it has failed over and overIt's time to replace the democrats with an actual leftist party that is willing to make changes.
