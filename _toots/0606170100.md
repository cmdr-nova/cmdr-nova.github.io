It bothers me that, even after writing about what those twitter-synthwave people did 4 years ago, for ... the 4th time? That it's still nothing but smokeThey've done this to at least 5 other people, 3 or 4 of them trans womenAnd trying over and over to make them face what they've done is like spitting against a brick wall
