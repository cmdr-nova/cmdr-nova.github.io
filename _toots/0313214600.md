You know I wonder if it's my Dell USB hub that's been causing problems in Debian lolRunning a keyboard, mouse, and audio essentially through "one" USB port is maybe causing crashes, issues?Don't get me wrong, if this is the issue, I'm slapping myselfBut I still think it was a great idea to buy a new PC lol
