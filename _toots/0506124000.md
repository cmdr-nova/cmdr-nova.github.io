How did I end up reading a Yale article about “why people won’t stop talking about polyamory” Was mostly agreeable, like it’s fine people can do what they wanna do, it DOES get annoying when you have to read about it nonstop when you are wholeheartedly not interested in it (every poly relationship I’ve tried ended up manipulative or abusive, but deff not indicative of EVERYONE, of course)But definitely not something I would expect to be written by someone at Yale
