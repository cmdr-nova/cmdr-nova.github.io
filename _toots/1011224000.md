people go on the big social media sites and talk about how much better everything was in the past, and their point of reference is stores, or the act of buying thingsnot gonna lie, i _do_ think the 90s and early 2000s were better, but our fondest memories of society before it got cold and grey shouldn't just all be about consumerism?like what about when going online was an adventure, or when you _didn't_ know what your friends were up to 24/7, how gaming was better cause it didn't take 13 years to make a game, how even facebook wasn't some garbage dump of slop and kind of a normal site that also wasn't tracking you lol
