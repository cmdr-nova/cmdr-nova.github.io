very cool how Threads appears to cut out the link preview for my websiteSee, I'm trying to keep one foot in corpo social media, cause that's where a lot of the people are who don't think about security or information privacy, which is A LOT  of people, and I still need some kind of reach in their directionbut corporate social media is so egregiously hostile to you if you do anything besides post and log off
