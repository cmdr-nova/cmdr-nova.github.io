Remembering back tho, when I was a kid in like 1999/2000, learning app development, how to tear down PCs and put them together again. It was the greatest class. And the only reason I ended up in a different school, in another district, shoved into a Microsoft Office class, is because I was bullied so hard, kids were throwing batteries at me, name-calling, bullying in-general, to the point that I eventually snapped and had a school-wide outburst in the lunch cafeteriaI remember my parents being mad at me, having to move, having to reintegrate, and not seeing most of my friends ever againMore people on a long list who never apologized for their behavior, but also? Thinking about this at nearly 40 years of age, that's really fucked up. Really fucked up that the school district allowed that to happen and then come to pass, and that anyone was mad at ME? And that _I had to move because of it_
