Alright, the Linden I was talking with came and cut out a little bit more land for me.Easy peasy, now I can start building!I do think it's kinda funny tho, you can pay ... 30 dollars a month? And have just 500 land impact shy of what you get for 110 dollars a month on a homestead, by just buying up mainland spaceDownside is, I'll potentially annoy people by building a dystopian industrial city right next to their resorts and vacation homes, but they can move (and then I can buy their land wahaha)
