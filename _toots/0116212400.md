The weird little aggressive guy who had apparently stalked a 17 y/o while he and I worked in the same building (I transferred) finally (told by a friend) quit his job today lolStill blows my mind they refused to fire him the many times he had steroid-rage-attacks, or the times he threatened people and almost got into fights Had I been his manager at the time he’d have been gone a long time ago
