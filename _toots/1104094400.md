This is the Bluesky bot template by the wayhttps://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/botsIt's pretty neat that they just tell you how to make one so you can be up and running in 5 minutesBut yeah brother ew, I dunno if it's a good idea to just store your username and password in an environment file on the server
