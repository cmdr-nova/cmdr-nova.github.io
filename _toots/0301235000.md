Prompt: Is fate real?Do you believe in fate/destiny? Today’s Wordpress prompt is all about a theme featured in one of my favorite movie franchises: The Matrix. Are our fates already foretold? Normally, I would say, no. Absolutely not. The universe exists in total chaos and we, the human species, exist entirely by biological accident. But then again, maybe that’s incorrect? There are already theories about potential for a multiverse to be a thing that really exists.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/01/prompt-is-fate-real/
