I kind of want to write about the downward path that Bluesky is obviously heading, i.e., deployment > venture capital funding > massive user influx > rightwing extremists > failure of moderation > ??? > ads > revenue generation > trackers > muddy moderation policies > enshitificationI can see it coming from a mile away, and it's kind of sad that it's blown up so much because so many people are convinced that it's the last bastion of hope for a social web ... for some reason
