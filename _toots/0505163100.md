Haven't had much luck with traditional dating apps, unless I'm on there to be scammed and instagram profile spammedI'm looking on reddit to see if Grindr is viable to meet trans women in my area, or at least gender nonconforming people and then I read thisPeople gotta get out of the stone-age with how they think about being trans, but I also blame the reddit transcommunity for being just in-general a horrible shitty place
