Speaking of shuttering things, and re-prioritizing my life and the things I'm paying for, I've decided I WILL keep my Mastodon instance. I have a job, after-all, and if I can't pay one little 39 dollar bill per month for something I WANT then what the hell are we doing here lolBut in that regard, I will no longer be posting on Threads, and will relegate all of my activity here, because I may as well get my money's worth, ay?
