Chapter 1.2 / A Routine Assignmentthe impasse I originally came to in the story was where I got to this point where the story doubled-back to the flash forward of the prologue, and the character was faced with isolation, in a nearly empty universe aboard a ship, and it's like "alright so where do we go from here"
