Some scammer/s have been trying to gain access to my Microsoft account, which is basically impossible, cause they need my face to do soRegardless, I changed my password, and RIGHT when emails went out to my other accounts that my password was changed (because I did so), I got a call from a potential spam number lolF*ck off "microsoft tech support"
