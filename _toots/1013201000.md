but i do still think about those years i spent trying to work for myself and not really making an income that really got where i needed it to beand i think in the 4 years i've been back on the job market, i've learned most of the skills i needed 5 years ago, to build an income on my ownnow i just need the time and energy to make it happen regardless of the day job
