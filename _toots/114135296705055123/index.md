Alright! I made a single Ruby script that ingests a [#Bluesky](https://mastodon.online/tags/Bluesky) RSS feed, and then converts it into markdown using a defined template within the script itself, keeps track of the last skeet ingested with a GUID, ignores reposts, quote posts, and replies, and also downloads any media attached to a "skeet" and then places them into a _skeet folder

Then, like with my toots, I placed them into my chronological website feed
