See, I’m getting good responses to the questions I posed with my blog post last night, but I’m also getting the nasty, bad faith, holier-than-tho trash who assume anyone asking “how do artists really actually fit on mastodon and how do you build an audience” are brand new to the fediverse and trying to engagement farmLike that’s not it at allI’m asking these questions because I’m sick and tired of working myself to death and I’m tired of playing the lottery of algorithmic social media, and I wanna know how anyone becomes _known_ on mastodon lol
