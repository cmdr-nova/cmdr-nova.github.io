People who excuse the use of generative AI will continue to balloon, as does the bubble that'll eventually pop.

And I do realize I'm on an instance that allows it as long as it's tagged and not the purpose of your account, that's fine. You can post sludge, people don't have to look at it.

That it's spreading like some kind of mind-virus where people just throw up their arms, give in and go "you know what, it's fine"

The same kind of weak-willed shite that put the US in the situation it's in
