kinda sucks that in the year i decide to make it a goal for myself to find remote work and leave the constant stress of retail, that the only "job" likely hiring is being a prompterwhich by all means, is easy. you don't have to be a genius to prompt an llmit's just that it sucks and you shouldn't do it
