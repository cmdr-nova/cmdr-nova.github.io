I mean, I _am_ technically publishing to my site, every single time I make a new, single post to Mastodon.

I _could_ rename "toots" on my site to "notes", and have them be part of my RSS, and essentially make Mastodon my website publishing software lol

But I also shotgun posts out on here like wild sometimes and that would explode an RSS feed
