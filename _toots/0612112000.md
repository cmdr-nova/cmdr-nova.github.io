I wish I would've saved the archives from the last two times I had a wordpress self hosted site. I remember some divisive LGBTQ+ topics I once wrote about years ago, that Parker Malloy called, to her followers (lol) "Mostly hyperbole, with grains of truth"Which _kind of_ killed my writing spirit then, because I looked up to her, and I wanted to enter the online reporter/writing fieldStill tho, I wish I still had those posts for historical reasons, at least
