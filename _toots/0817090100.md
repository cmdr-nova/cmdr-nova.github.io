It kind of sucks that Twitter has been destroyed to the point in that its useless for boosting genuine calls for help, but I deleted my account anyway and I'm not going to waste the finger strength bringing it back before the 30 day deadline is up. That account can stay dead, and I doubt I'd get any help there, anyway
