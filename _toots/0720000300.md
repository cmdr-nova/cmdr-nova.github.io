Like this one quest, you start helping out one of your companions in a little river-side game that civilians participate in. But something disrupts it and you have to investigate. Everyone's evacuated to the city, and then the quest continues in a challenge dungeon where you're met with the ghosts of the participants of the same game, but a decade ago.Monsters are devouring their essence and attacking as you make your way through. The essence of people your companion once knew, and another version of himself when he was younger.In the final fight, the boss transforms into someone your companion once knew, and he closes his eyes and makes the final strike.The quest ends with a sequence of his friends from the past on the shore of a beach with the sun going down waving to him.
