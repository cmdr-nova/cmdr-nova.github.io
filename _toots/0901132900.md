In all seriousness though, if anything's going to keep people away from Mastodon and stuck on websites like Threads and Bluesky, or even Xitter, it's the random people on the fedi timeline who spend half their time condemning people for making art, and music, and other digital things and trying to sell them, on the fediverseEliminate the need for money, and you will have your perfect society where nobody is trying to make it
