I feel like some people are misinterpreting that Bluesky AI opt out article, not saying that Bluesky has nothing to be criticized (they do), but I don’t see anything about them selling your data

Also, mastodon should have safeguards against AI, but I don’t see that. I see big instances saying “you can post AI as long as you say that’s what it is”
