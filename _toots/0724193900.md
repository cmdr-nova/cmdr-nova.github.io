I'm about to just trash this whole jekyll sitei have a full time job, I cannot waste 3 whole days of time to myself sifting through 10 different websites where the author badly explains how to get paginator workinglike i'm starting to get pissed off lolthis does not make ANY sensejekyll runs on MARKDOWNthe only html files are ones that call back TO THE MARKDOWNif you make the blog folder it suggests and put the code for page numbering in THERE, IT DOES NOTHING. I HATE THIS.
