I will say that any time I see an aggressive, nasty, unhinged post that looks like it's been posted only to get eyes on it and cause rage-response, it's a post coming from ThreadsAnd I'm wondering if this happens because there's no algorithm on MastodonI don't see stuff like that if I view my personal Threads timeline, but from here, the people who get off on baiting rage just come through like water in a tube
