Oh, I guess maybe it would benefit fedizens to know about this guy over on Fosstodon. Caught up on my blog spreading the evangelist #AI  point of view, and after visiting his profile, he appears to be someone who _literally_ makes scrapersEvery instance can have their own rules, or how they want to do things, but this is for the people who want to keep their information safe and who value consent and privacy.It is my opinion he should go back to Twitter
