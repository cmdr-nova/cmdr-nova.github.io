I've running my website on a self hosted wordpress site now for almost 6 months, which I think is longer than I've ever done solike back in the day when all my money was coming from Patreon and I had a site for a month or so (I don't remember), and foolishly shut it down _without backing up any of it_But it just feels normal to have now lol
