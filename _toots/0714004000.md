politics, violenceThe violence that happened today happened in my home state, and although I don't know how far from me this was because I haven't looked it up, it arose some conflicted feelings.I don't like either candidates, but I also don't want to live in the middle of an ongoing civil warI've joked about things in the past, sure, but I kind of do really think there are ... better ways to address grievances, and matters of political issues that doesn't involve pulling out a gun and firing at a politician and also a crowd of peopleIt's really no better than any other mass shooting in this country
