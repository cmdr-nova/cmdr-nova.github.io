NFTs, what if they didn't suck?Here's an interesting question: If NFTs weren't using up energy needlessly, weren't a concept filled to the brim with gamblers, scammers, and otherwise grifter types, and were _just_ a way to casually collect limited edition art, digitallyWould you find them interesting?I ask, because I saw someone else say it, but I do still think that's kind of cool? I mean we live in a digital age and people buy digital things all the time. The concept of a limited edition avatar, or piece of art, that you can be like "I supported this and it's special" is in its base, neat.But it's also blockchain, and rife with pump and dump crap, people trying to make millions and launder money.I dunno, you tell me
