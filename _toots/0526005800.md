I decided to pause 3 Body Problem and watch Adam Sandler’s Spaceman, and …It is very strange, and about a husband and wife, and a cloud beyond Jupiter, and there’s also a large talking spider. The funny thing is, this is not a new concept in fiction, because it exists in the book Children of TimeI wonder if that’s where this came from lol
