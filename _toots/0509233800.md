I saw someone explain why liminal spaces are so scaryBasically, liminal space comes from "transitional spaces", like hallways. You aren't meant to -exist- long-term in spaces like that. You're not meant to exist long-term at a gas station at 3am.So when you're forced to, nowhere to back away into safety, stuck in constant transitional space, that's where the fear comes from. There is no safety in always being exposed
