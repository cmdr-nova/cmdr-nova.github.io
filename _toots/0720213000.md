A mastodon instance should do what it does now, but it should also be an origin point for account keys, and those keys should hold access to your data, including followers, follows, DMs, and your POSTS, and you should be able to take all of that anywhere Every instance you’ve federated with already has your posts backed up, to the point where in some cases you can’t even fully delete anything I think this is the next thing Gargle should be focusing on
