So, I still have an Instagram account, hardly use it, but I see the tab, I click it, and my whole entire account is suspended.

Their "technology" (really big finger quotes here) decided that I was impersonating myself, and that I'm fake lol

I submitted an appeal but honestly their AI can delete it for all I care
