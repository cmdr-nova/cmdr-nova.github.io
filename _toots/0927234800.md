watching people on reddit who work at the place that I do in different states, posting photos of massive flooding, but the more worrying posts like, posting a screenshot of their phone with like 5 "do not go outside, do not drive, life threatening weather" etc, etc, and they ask "do you think i'll get in trouble if i call off"listen, if there are any people on here following me who are really young, or new to the job world, never ever ever put a job before your safetyi don't care if the next paycheck is what you need to pay your rent, i don't care if your boss is threatening to fire you if you don't drive in weather that the literal state is telling you _not to_none of this matters if you die because of a job that will replace you in 30 seconds
