imagine if you were running for president and in the middle of a debate with your opponent who's lying and spreading misinformation, you just take a giant gulp of soda into your mic that stops everyone dead, and then you're like "oh, continue, please"but then when he starts talking again you pull out your phone and start texting someone, and the volume is up all the way and being picked up by the mic and it's like "tic tic tic tac tac tic tic", and then you look up and you're like "excuse me, go ahead"and then your opponent talks for like 30 more seconds and then he looks over at you and you're scrolling your phone again and then you just burst out laughing like you forgot where you were, and then you look up and clear your throat, "you were saying?"
