Someone on my posts about that ai theft instance decided they needed to argue that, because they personally don’t really make any sales on their art, they’re not concerned with other artist’s work being stolen by LLMsI don’t think I believe that we’ve sunk this low beyond compassion, and I won’t believe itBecause people are helping me today, and the cost of these vehicle repairs are slowly shrinking, and that’s really enough to believe that there are people who do care about things
