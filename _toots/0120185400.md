I enjoy that a lot of people are making high quality Backrooms content on youtube, but also, it really seems like the process goes like this:Kane, makes backrooms videos of yellow hallways and offices with howler/bacteria entitieseveryone: *does that also*Kane, makes a found footage that isn't just yellow hallways and more like a lived in population complex that's more eerily abandonedeveryone: ohhhh, okay we'll also do thatThese concepts aren't that complicated guys
