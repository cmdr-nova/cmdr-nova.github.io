Neo Machina: ClosedSo, I already closed my city in Second Life back in November last year, but at the time, I wasn’t ready to put an end to it just yet. I thought maybe I'd give it one last blast to see if I could get it to really take hold in the broader Second Life community, and then I did the bold thing and upgraded to a full region.https://cmdr-nova.online/2024/03/02/neo-machina-closed/
