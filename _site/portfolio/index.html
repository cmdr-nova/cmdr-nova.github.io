<h2>websites:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="/" target="_blank">NOVA PRIME</a> : my personal website, a blog filled with hours, weeks, & months of written text, in the style of a purposely de-modernized theme with a slight mixture of actual modern code (think, if geocities met css & javascript).</p>

<p>the current iteration of nova prime was developed by deploying a build of jekyll's minima theme (via ruby) as a static site, and then i systematically dismantled it until it was my own site. see the <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/cmdr-nova.github.io/tree/master" target="_blank">github repository</a> for a look into the chaos.</p>

<p>░ <a href="/classic" target="_blank">NOVA PRIME (OLD VERSION)</a> : the old version of my website that came before what this portfolio is attached to. basically the same thing, but a bit more rough and brightly colored.</p>

<p>this version of nova prime as hand-written via many, <i>many</i>, pieces of frankensteined code.</p>

<p>░ <a href="/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">LINKGARDEN</a> : i recognized the need to have a landing page where people could immediately see my most important links, content i'm working on, and where to find me--without an entire website of novels-worth of text in their way. and then this gave me an idea: hey, self, this is something a lot of people use, and <i>also</i>, a lot of them are paying some service on a monthly basis to have something that's relatively simple to code, and display. therein, linkgarden was born.</p>

<h2>music:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">EYESHADOW 2600 FM</a> : a body of work created from the years of 2017 to 2023, from experimental garbage-electronic, to full-on darksynth, electro, & ambient.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">PLEXX</a> : my latest venture into continuing most of the same trends, with a dash of nineties liminal horror.</p>

<h2>scripts:</h2>
<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/the_daily_report" target="_blank">THE DAILY REPORT</a> : a python script that picks from a list of defined subreddits, and then sends you an email of the top 5 trending posts. this is best used as a cronjob, scheduled daily.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/reddit_bot" target="_blank">REDDIT BOT</a> : a python script that picks from a list of subreddits and looks through the top 50 trending posts (image posts only), and then posts just one, at random, to an automated mastodon account. also best used as a cronjob for continual posts, but can absolutely be used to post whenever you want with one command.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/blog-poster" target="_blank">BLOG POSTER</a> : a python script that reads your RSS feed, and posts new items it finds to both mastodon and a discord channel, and upon first run, adds all current items to a json in order to avoid spamming and posting old content.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/chatter-bot" target="_blank">CHATTER BOT</a> : a python script that posts random defined status messages to mastodon, and also replies to mentions with random predefined statuses.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/post_gen_bot" target="_blank">POST GEN BOT</a> : a python script that generates random posts for mastodon, derived specifically from google sheets.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/SL-Online" target="_blank">SL ONLINE</a> : a python script that reads online data from second life, and posts that data to a specified mastodon account. </p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/Anti-Webp" target="_blank">ANTI WEBP</a> : a python script that runs on a cronjob and converts any .webp images in your linux downloads folder to a .png instead.</p>

<p>░ <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/poast" target="_blank">POAST</a> : an absolutely convoluted mess of a script that runs via a github workflow, and then through python on a vps, in order to post your jekyll blog posts directly to mastodon.</p>
