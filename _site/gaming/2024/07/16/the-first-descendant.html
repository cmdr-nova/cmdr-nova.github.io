<div class="indent">
<p>Over the past week, I’ve spent a little time here and there checking out the latest game out of grindy, microtransaction game maker, Nexon. This is what I think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Hold up, haven’t I seen this before?</strong></p>

<p>Back in the olden days of gaming o’ yore, there was a time when Shephards saved the galaxy, and the Inquisition had only just begun, guards of the veil be damned. Before developer studios killed their community forums and moved communication to Twitter, and while we were all playing Mafia Wars and The Sims Social on Facebook, awkwardly flirting with sims created by our close friends. An age where the latest Sims game didn’t have swimming pools, and most of us were still venturing out Into the Future.</p>

<p>That time was 2014. A time before gaming was corrupted by an onslaught of nonstop subscription models and battle passes. When 30 hours to beat a game was perfectly acceptable. When loading into something brand new, felt … exciting.</p>

<p>But war, war has changed.</p>

<p>Warframe was released in 2013, and then later, for the Playstation 4, in 2014. This was mostly only an alpha, and all you could really do was jump down to a handful of extermination missions from a static solar system map.</p>

<p>Around the same timeframe, the first Destiny was released on consoles, and, at the time, didn’t even remotely touch a PC.</p>

<p>Both games shared (and still share) similarities. As Warframe evolved, it became a mission-hub, shooter-looter game where you built your character, played with friends, and spent the rest of your time sifting through playing-card-eque warframe modifications. Destiny, and then its sequel, years later, are really not all that different.</p>

<p>It’s a theme I don’t feel has really caught on all that much outside of … well, Warframe and Destiny. Sure, we have Helldivers 2, but, that’s kinda sorta similar, but also not <em>really</em>.</p>

<p>Warframe and Destiny 2 exist as “live service” games. Games that exist without a subscription, but <em>do</em> have expansions and microtransactions, and are persistent, never-ending. I think back in the golden age of gaming, we would call this a hybrid MMO.</p>

<p>They don’t really exist in a niche, but this genre has largely been overshadowed by MOBAs, and then survival games, and then battle royales. I think the battle royale genre still reigns supreme as one of the most popular format of games to play. Although, personally, it’s starting to feel pretty stale for me. Even <em>if</em> Apex Legends is really cool.</p>

<p>But, now we’re in 2024. Warframe has been out for about 11 years, and Destiny has been chugging along for around the same amount of time. And I guess Nexon decided to throw their own hat into the ring. For … reasons?</p>

<p>Enter: The First Descendant. Like if Mass Effect Andromeda had a child with Destiny, and then got cybernetically modified with implants from Warframe. It’s a game occupying a concept that already exists, so much so, they purposely or accidentally <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-first-descendant/nexon-statement-destiny-2" target="_blank">copied UI design</a> directly from Destiny 2. And, as damning as this may look, I decided to give the game a shot, regardless.</p>

<p><strong>Hello, I am now a bunny.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/first_des/bunny.png" alt="Screenshot from The First Descendant, depicting a woman with top buns in her hair wearing what resembles the blue and white plug suit from Neon Genesis Evangelion, of the character Rei." /></p>

<p>The game starts out kind of unremarkable, dropping you into a sci-fi universe where an evil big guy wants an artifact for his own evil doing and bidding, and you’ve got to stop him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The First Descendant is a third-person looter shooter powered by Unreal Engine 5. Become a Descendant. Fight for the survival of humanity. Descendants have unique abilities to tackle both solo and co-op missions. Up to 4 players use varied mechanics to defeat giant bosses. BE THE FIRST DESCENDANT!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It … kind of reminds me of the beginning of Destiny 2, paraphrased and rewritten.</p>

<p>You’re a descendant, and you can do really cool stuff with your hands, like shoot out ice, or electricity, and also fire guns at monsters.</p>

<p>My first impression, is that the gun play kind of <em>sucks</em>. It feels like holding a stick and going “pew pew pew” with imaginary bullets. Sure, they’re actually coming out of the gun, but there’s next to no <em>feedback</em> when you’re firing a gun, and when your shots are hitting your target. It just doesn’t <em>feel</em> like I’m shooting a weapon that kills things.</p>

<p>Now, the graphics are pretty slick, and, well, I don’t know if this is an issue with Linux, or what, but I’m running pretty <em>good</em> hardware, okay? And having the settings on high, I get great FPS … until I venture into an area where there’s a lot going on, or onto a battlefield where missions are happening. Everything slows down to a 15 FPS slug-fest. And, apparently, this is something that’s happening to a lot of people, and it <em>may</em> not actually be a hardware issue.</p>

<p>It’s been quite a while since I’ve felt the struggle of a poorly optimized game.</p>

<p>Within the first ten levels, I wasn’t really feeling like I was having all that much fun. I was feeling like I was just shooting a gun at some aliens until loot popped out, and repeating the process over and over until I was really powerful, and also had access to the Bunny descendant.</p>

<p>This is about where things start to get better. I <em>like the bunny lady</em>.</p>

<p>With my descendant now fully maxed out with all the gear you can wear, and equipped with modifications (that has an interface eerily similar to Warframe), I’m starting to feel like progress is happening.</p>

<p>I notice something though … this game takes place, <em>entirely</em>, on just one planet? Did I miss something? What happens when you’ve completed all the missions across the map? Is it endgame time? Do I get to go to space and see other planets?</p>

<p>I mean, this is what I’m expecting, since this is a direct copy and paste of Destiny and Warframe. But I’ve done almost no reading on the extended story of this game, and am speaking about it now from only first-hand experience.</p>

<p>But what about the voice acting?</p>

<p>The voice-overs in TFD sound like a typical dub in an anime. Some of them are alright, some of them sound like the person speaking has no emotional capacity whatsoever. It’s a very, Nexon-ish, Eastern grinder game. Which is fine! Grinding mobs for loot is something I’ve done since 2001, when I joined Anarchy Online.</p>

<p><strong>More issues, and stuff, and things</strong>.</p>

<p>From the jump, to level 14, I’m only really <em>now</em> starting to feel like I could enjoy TFD, and that’s <em>if</em> they continue to fix it, and put out new content, and aren’t sued by two different developer studios.</p>

<p>One of the issues I encountered while randomly playing the game, thus far, is that pretty much all the content is designed with having other people around you, in mind. Except, even though there are a lot of people playing this game, sometimes there is nobody doing the mission you need help with. So, you kind of just fail, and then fail again, and then either stand there and wait for someone to waltz in, or go do another mission and return later.</p>

<p>I’ve said it before years and years ago, and over and over again since then: A persistent online game where there <em>is only</em> group content, is a game I’m not that interested in.</p>

<p>Eve Online is <em>great</em>, until you find out you can’t do anything actually fun or remarkable unless you become a social butterfly and join massive corporations, and constantly collaborate with other people. I’m a recluse! I don’t want to do that all the time!</p>

<p>Albion Online is awesome … until you hit a wall and find out you’re gonna die, son. You’re gonna die and enjoy it, unless you join a guild with active players, and collab–You already know what the heck’s going on.</p>

<p>Black Desert Online is exactly the same, but it has more solo content than the previously mentioned games.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to get at here is, even if your game is online only, built around co-op and being massively multiplayer, you <em>still</em> need to have content people can do <em>by themselves</em>, or you’re going to annoy me. You’re going to bring a screeching halt to your entire game if for some reason a ton of people just <em>stop playing</em>.</p>

<p>I <em>will</em> give TFD a little merit, though. One of the reasons I don’t really play Warframe, is that their story and quests are ridiculously convoluted, and not very friendly to people who have day jobs. You’re telling me I have to grind <em>for a week</em> if I want a cool gun? Are you fuggin’ serious, dude?</p>

<p>The same kind of goes for Destiny. I like the theme, but I <em>don’t like</em> how a lot of the game kind of feels like a slog, until you get to the content you <em>want</em> to be in.</p>

<p>TFD, so far, you pretty much just blast through everything like a stream of water through toilet paper.</p>

<p>This could be good, or bad, depending on what exactly the endgame <em>is</em>.</p>

<p><strong>At the end of it all</strong>.</p>

<p>With my initial impressions down, and my extensive history of having seen this all before, and knowing exactly who Nexon is, as a company, and what they’re probably going to do (Hello, exorbitant cash shop prices), would I continue playing?</p>

<p>Probably. I kind of <em>do</em> want to see what the endgame is like, and just how deep customization and stat-building goes.</p>

<p>Would I recommend it to other people?</p>

<p>Uh … maybe? If you feel the same way I do about Warframe and Destiny? Give it a shot, maybe we’ll talk, and I’ll help you shoot some mindless aliens.</p>
