One of the issues I was having, is that it’s <em>really</em> cumbersome to have to generate a post, then make that post, then commit, and sync to NeoCities … <em>just to put up one Post, Note, or Log</em>. To me, this is useful, and really cool, but it also doesn’t <em>feel</em> like posting on social media. So what do you do?</p>

<p>Well, of course, you setup reverse publishing/syndication, and backup every single thing you post to Mastodon in converted markdown files formatted for Jekyll, that are then fed into a Liquid feed!</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://git.garrido.io/gabriel/mastodon-markdown-archive#installation" target="_blank">this repository</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you go through the process of getting this thing setup, and <em>make sure</em> you specify that you want to use a Jekyll template (you’ve got to set that up yourself), and point it at a directory on your website, so that you can effectively setup a cronjob that just backs up all of your posts, <em>daily</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s my bash script for backing up my Mastodon posts to a directory on my local machine, where my website is stored:</p>

<p><em>graboots.sh</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash

export MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here

PREVIOUS_SINCE_ID=""

# Function to delete posts containing the specified phrase
delete_posts_with_phrase() {
  local phrase="$1"
  local directory="$2"
  for post_file in "$directory"/*.md; do
    if grep -q "$phrase" "$post_file"; then
      echo "Excluding post: $post_file"
      rm "$post_file"
    fi
  done
}

while true; do
  SINCE_ID=$(test -f /home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots/first &amp;&amp; cat /home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots/first || echo '')
  
  if [[ "$SINCE_ID" == "$PREVIOUS_SINCE_ID" ]]; then
    echo "No new posts. Exiting"
    break
  fi

  command="/home/cmdr-nova/.local/go/bin/mastodon-markdown-archive --dist=/home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots \

    --since-id=$SINCE_ID \
    --template=/home/cmdr-nova/jekyll.tmpl \
    --filename={{.Post.Id}}.md"
  
  output=$($command)

  if [[ "$output" -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "No new posts. Exiting"
    break
  fi
  echo "Fetched $output posts. Continuing."
  
  # Delete posts containing the phrase "Posted via Nova Prime:"
  delete_posts_with_phrase "Posted via Nova Prime:" "/home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots"
  
  PREVIOUS_SINCE_ID=$SINCE_ID
  sleep 1
done

<p>But then, this isn’t <em>everything</em> you need to do in order to make this work, right? So, you probably <em>also</em> want each of these posts on your site to link back to their original location (for as long as they exist), and to <em>also</em> use the images include in posts that are backed up, <em>that have images</em>, right?</p>

<p>Okay, so run this script every single time you build your Jekyll site:</p>

<p><em>syndicate_toots.py</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import os

    # Construct the Mastodon syndication
    mastodon_link = f'https://mastodon.online/@cmdr_nova/{post_id}'

    # Read the content of the toot
    with open(toot_file, 'r') as file:
        content = file.readlines()

    # Check if the mastodon link is already present
    if not any(line.startswith('mastodon:') for line in content):
        # Insert the mastodon link into the front matter
        for i, line in enumerate(content):
            if line.strip() == '---' and i != 0:
                content.insert(i, f'mastodon: {mastodon_link}\n')
                break

    if os.path.exists(index_file):
        # Extract the post ID from the folder name
        post_id = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(index_file))
        # Find the image file in the folder (assuming only one image per folder)
        image_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(toot_folder, '*.*'))
        image_path = None

                break
        update_toot_file(index_file, post_id, image_path)

print("Toots updated successfully.")

<p>Now, <em>obviously</em>, this is going to take a bit more setup than just putting both of these scripts together. You probably keep your files in different places than I do, and you might not even <em>want</em> a Jekyll template. Furthermore, you also still need to construct your site in order to be <em>able</em> to include these markdown files <em>within</em> the Liquid feed that’s already included on a Jekyll website.</p>

<p>But, other than that, there we go!</p>

<p>Everything I post on Mastodon, will now post to my website (as long as I remember to commit and sync daily), using this cronjob:</p>

<p>This is, <em>essentially</em>, my answer as to <em>how</em> to make it so that I can post to my website from my phone, albeit, a little bit of an extreme work-around, but very simple once you’ve got it all up and running.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Webdev" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="syndication" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been doing a lot in order to get my website to act as a more central place where all of my thoughts and posts are stored.

<p>What I’m writing about today, is more on that same subject, and also in regard to someone I once looked up to.</p>

<p>I have kind of a … complicated history, in regard to Parker Molloy. Back on Twitter, almost ten years ago at this point, I was kind of a hopeful writer who wanted to be like her. I wanted to write for publications and make <em>that</em> my career. In retrospect, I still think it would be cool if that happened.</p>

<p>But … I wrote some kind of “article” piece on my website at the time, which was just some hacky Wordpress looking thing, about an LGBTQ+ topic (I don’t even remember anymore what that topic was), and then I shared it with her. I guess I was hoping to get some kind of notable mention, or a foot-in-the-door toward what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Instead, she quoted my post, and called it “Mostly hyperbole, with grains of truth.” To which I was made fun of, and heckled by her followers.</p>

<p>Flash forward, it’s 2025, and I’m quoting Parker Molloy from her Bluesky account, where she’s pointing out that the one and singular moderation team behind Bluesky has completely removed a post from being viewed by <em>the entire network</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="bluesky-embed" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:hf7ezrajxadu7v3tzcyij424/app.bsky.feed.post/3lj3uxy6ohs23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidabkqnp3uiuigwezilj6esiqy5dtth7f4t6yz675hfpekmafbphq"><p lang="en">It&#x27;s clearly newsworthy.

<p>So, it seems to <em>look like</em> the Bluesky moderation is protecting Donald Trump’s interests, and proving even more-so, that the people behind Bluesky understand “decentralization” much in the same way Bitcoin investors do: They don’t.</p>

<p>The content of the video is questionable, of course. It … well, <em>is</em> an explicit, non-consensual generation, deep-fake, AI … <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>The question is: Should anyone give a shit? Should anyone <em>give two shits</em> when this kind of thing is targeting two people who are absolutely tearing down and devastating not just the entire United States, but the <em>world</em>, at-large?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Is it <em>newsworthy</em>, does it <em>matter</em>, according to Parker, if it remains on the platform? I think it’s actually <em>more</em> newsworthy that Bluesky has, over, and over again, shown their real colors, by continuing to protect the interests of <em>fascists</em>.</p>

<p>So, in that respect, yeah, it <em>does</em> matter that they took it down.</p>

<p>It matters that an alleged twenty to thirty million people continue to use this network, despite <em>all of the evidence</em> that they shouldn’t, while an <em>actual</em> decentralized solution is directly in front of all of them. And their excuses for not distancing themselves from fascist venture capitalists, range from “I don’t like nerd shit” and “Choosing servers is hard.”</p>

<p>Well, I think, at this point, the bed’s made, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Yeah, I have an account on Bluesky, where I’m mostly feeding RSS updates. Just like I have a <em>mostly</em> inactive account on Threads where I occasionally log on to see if the influencers, who don’t talk to anyone, are still complaining about nobody interacting with them.</p>

<p>But, like I do, each time that Bluesky fucks up, I’ll provide a link here to a site where you can decide for yourself, if you’d like to <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net/?lang=en-us" target="_blank">join the ActivityPub network</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve probably heard it by now, or have seen my many posts on here about Bluesky, and their false claims of decentralization, or of what kind of social network they’re even trying to be.

At least, since I introduced writing Notes and Logs on here, in a quick and simple way to just <em>post something</em> without worrying about it sounding coherent and planned. It’s only going to continue, from here, though, when I figure out how I can do this <em>easily</em> from my phone. But, I’m not writing this to talk about how much I like shotgunning random crap into the world via my own website. I wanted to talk about RSS.</p>

<p>Sure, I could talk about Bluesky again, and how, no matter how much I try and enjoy or like the app, the feed keeps working <em>against</em> my interest and attention.</p>

<p>I could talk about how I’m entering day five of my offline job, five days after having one day off that I had after three days of work. A nine day stretch where I’ve had little rest, and hardly any sleep.</p>

<p>But, no! It’s RSS time.</p>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> RSS?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication)[2] is a web feed[3] that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. News aggregators (or “RSS readers”) can be built into a browser, installed on a desktop computer, or installed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank"><i>via Wikipedia.</i></a></p>

<p>RSS is something that “came out” a little over 25 years ago, now, in 1999, when Netscape was still a browser you could use. Fun fact! Did you know the corporate bloodsuckers destroying Mozilla own Netscape, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite#History_and_development" target="_blank">it’s called Firefox</a>?</p>

<p>Ever since its beginnings, it’s always just been this plain text thing that you can plug into a reader, and use to keep tabs on your favorite subjects, or people’s blogs. And that’s what it <em>remains</em>, today. But, as social media eats itself alive, and the options grow fewer (aside from ActivityPub and <em>maybe</em> Bluesky), RSS becomes <em>very important</em>, once again.</p>

<p>Fun fact, number two! Did you know that Youtube channels have RSS feeds? Did you know that you can subvert all of Google’s ads no matter <em>what they do</em>, by simply using <a href="https://freetubeapp.io" target="_blank">FreeTube</a>, an app that pulls from Youtube RSS feeds?</p>

<p>I’ve talked before about how you should have a website. How all of your data should <em>belong to you</em>, and not some billionaire jerk-ass who can and <em>will</em> delete everything you’ve ever done in the snap of a finger, just because. And I’ve <em>even</em> written guides on how to build one yourself.</p>

<p>But, what do you do <em>after</em> that? Well, … you setup an RSS feed, of course.</p>

<p>And it’s really simple, and maybe I’ll write a guide on how to do that, if whatever you’re using for your site doesn’t already provide you with one. You just setup an XML that reads your posts from a directory and then shoots them out into the digital universe.</p>

<p>I mean, okay. It’s a <em>little</em> more complicated than that. But! A lot of prebuilt blogging software <em>already</em> has this built-in. Wordpress has it. Ghost has it. Heck, I think Jekyll has a plugin, or a feature <em>built-in</em> to the software that generates one <em>for you</em>, but I made one myself. Because I’m not <em>just</em> sharing posts. And also, there’s some kind of weird timezone discrepancy I still haven’t figured out, that’s causing all kinds of issues.</p>

<p>You can see my RSS feed <a href="https://mkultra.monster/rss_feed.xml" target="_blank">here</a>, and, depending on what you’re using to view my site, it <em>might</em> show up as plain text versions of everything I post, <em>or</em>, it’ll look like a jumble of code with some words. Which is fine! Just plug the URL into a reader, or even your e-mail client (if it allows it), and voila!</p>

<p>Fun fact, number three! Did you know the <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">Vivaldi browser</a> has a reader built-in? And it’ll just automatically convert all of that weird code into a feed cloud that looks <em>a lot</em> like the Tumblr feeds of old (you know, that page you get when you’re viewing all of someone’s posts at once).</p>

<p>Say hello to long-form posts, without all the styling you have on your website (a great way for people to keep up with what you’re writing and saying, without having to go all the way to your site, itself), in a simple-to-read interface.</p>

<p>The thing is, you don’t <em>have</em> to keep it confined to <em>just</em> long-form blog posts, though. You can, essentially, use it as a mailing list. You can use it as a one-way social feed of your thoughts, to readers. You can use it to share pictures of your cat with <em>anyone who subscribes to your feed</em>.</p>

<p>Bro.</p>

<p>Welcome to social media, 1999.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, if you don’t want to do <em>any of this</em>, I would <em>at least</em> recommend finding a nice home on a solid server via Mastodon, or some-such ActivityPub app. But, if you want to get into the <em>really</em> hardcore nerd shit, definitely start using an RSS feed. And plug it <em>everywhere</em>. It’s like … a podcast, of your THOUGHTS! IT’S TELEPATHY!</p>

<p>For real though, as the infrastructure of everything crumbles and corporations destroy all that’s left that’s good in the world, you should have a contingency. Even if it means speaking to the internet the way that we used to, before Google destroyed everything.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><category term="rss" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a while since I’ve written some kind of long-form post on my site.

And, well, yeah. That’s exactly correct. For all intents and purposes, if you’re just online to chat, and make friends with random people, that’s cool. You can do that in any space you choose, and you <em>should</em>. That’s the way the internet used to be.</p>

<p>For people like me, I use the internet for this reason as well, even though I’m … <em>terrible</em> at making friends in my near 40s, as a closeted trans woman, who spends most of my life, nowadays, hiding <em>everything about myself</em> in public spaces, and just … surviving.</p>

<p>The other half of me is online, <em>still online</em>, attempting to share the things I do: The music, the writing, the art, the things I make in Second Life (even though I haven’t been paying much creative attention to that as of late), and it’s <em>rough</em>.</p>

<p>You’ve got places like Reddit that have this toxic mindset built-in, where the only people allowed to share their work, are people who have already made it big. Otherwise, you’re breaking the rules.</p>

<p>You’ve got Bluesky, where gaining traction with <em>anything</em> is like playing the lottery, and, like post-2020 social media everywhere, if you don’t employ manipulative engagement tactics, you’re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p>You’ve got Threads, which is exactly the same, except they’ve got <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/stories/meta-policy-updates-could-encourage-hate-threaten-democracy/" target="_blank">bigotry coded into their Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>And then you have Mastodon/ActivityPub (and other associated apps), where talking and chatting is highly encouraged, but building takes time. <em>A lot of time</em>. And some people <em>don’t even take kindly to those who are trying to build some kind of audience on the platform/s</em>. Which, is a shame. ActivityPub is probably one of the greatest things to happen to the internet. That it’s been partially colonized by the privileged who don’t or haven’t scraped by, or <em>needed</em> a helping hand, or even just <em>support for their work</em>, is a little bit of a minor tragedy.</p>

<p>But, it hasn’t suddenly become <em>more</em> hostile to creatives, online, though. It’s <em>always been that way</em>. It’s just <em>worse</em>, now. <em>Especially</em> with the rise of algorithmic theft from the un-creative, who seek to profit off of artificially generated slop, derived from people who <em>do</em> work.</p>

<p>Long ago, though, there was Twitter. The <em>real</em> Twitter. And, sure, the place was <em>always</em> toxic. This idealistic pretend idea that people have in their heads, that Twitter used to be some kind of amazing social utopia … are living in a fantasy world.</p>

<p>But!</p>

<p>Twitter was instrumental in my album <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/ride-eternal" target="_blank">Ride Eternal</a> becoming a bestseller (before the calamity of twitter-synthwave dudes having a meltdown over transness in “their” “scene”), and, apart from Mastodon (I have had a lot of random support via ActivityPub, sporadically, throughout the years), I made <em>a lot</em> of progress for my work on the platform. The loss of Twitter wasn’t just a loss of some central “community square” online, it was a loss in an audience of thousands of people I, and others, had connections to.</p>

<p>It’s all gone.</p>

<p>And, now, what are we left with? To sift and jump back and forth between different spaces, <em>hoping</em> that something <em>sticks</em> hard enough that you can stop jumping back … and forth.</p>

<p>For many, this hasn’t happened.</p>

<p>For me, that is why my website is now my own personal social platform. My most important thoughts, my writing, my announcements, my little shitposts, or random things I want to say: They come here, <em>first</em>, and then they go to the other places.</p>

<p>To me, this is <em>the only</em> answer to the loss of some central idea of a community square where you really <em>could</em> reach thousands of people who might be interested in what you do.</p>

<p>I will <em>never</em> put my work, my thoughts, and my words, solely into the hands of corporate overlords, <em>ever again</em>.</p>

<p>My website cannot be <em>taken</em> from me, it can’t be lost forever, it can’t be deleted by some CEO who didn’t like what I had to say, it can’t be mobbed and silenced by evil little shitheads with ulterior motives and fears over the marginalized occupying spaces in their industries.</p>

<p>As long as I have a PC, thumb drives, portable hard drives, a laptop, a <em>phone</em>, my website sticks around, no matter what happens to the server it’s hosted on.</p>

<p>And that’s <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>Even if the government becomes <em>fully</em> 1984, and blocks out all sorts of content at the ISP level, I’ll just take my website to TOR.</p>

<p>That’s why you should <em>own your content</em>.</p>

<p>You <em>should</em> post on these platforms, and try and see what sticks. But your most important posts, well, they should be on a website. <em>Your</em> website. In 2025, this is the <em>only answer</em> to the destruction of the digital social landscape, and you owe it to yourself to <em>at least</em> spin something up on a template builder, if <em>anything</em> (although I do encourage learning at least the basics of HTML).</p>

<p>It’s rough out there on the world wide web, and it’s <em>never</em> been harder for creatives to find their people, and their audience. But, it <em>can be done</em>. The first step, is to <em>own your content</em>.</p>

<p>Now, <em>of course</em>, some select few people might see this sort of idea as “nerd shit.” And they’re free to think that way. I remember back in middle and high school, when “nerd” was a legitimate insult that inspired all kinds of bullying. And, I’m thankful, that the internet is <em>not</em> high school, and that people who are mentally <em>stuck</em> there, <em>probably</em> won’t be a real big part of the future digital social landscape.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="creators" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see, sometimes, people talking about how they don’t really use any specific social media app as reinforcement of anything they do, or share, in regard to work, or art, and that if they did … if that was their main mode of deriving support, money, and so on, and so forth: They’d be screwed.

Now, I played a little bit of the first one, but that was years back, and I got confused or stuck around the beginning, so I didn’t really pick it up again. At the time, it was a game I never really saw anyone talk about, so I didn’t really assume much of it.</p>

<p>That was, until the second one released.</p>

<p>Long story short, I have it. I played through … the beginning.</p>

<p>Not to spoil too much, I <em>eventually</em> made it to the point where the game drops you off into the world, and pushes you in the direction of doing <em>whatever the heck it was you want to do.</em></p>

<p>Oh boy.</p>

<p>I got let out of the pillory (yes, you get arrested, for reasons), and my buddy, the stuck-up dude, well, he abandoned me. I’m not sure if this was a consequence of your own actions, or if it’s meant to happen. So, I’m just going to assume that this is <em>supposed</em> to happen.</p>

<p>A lady stops you and helps you out a little, mentions something about finding work.</p>

<p>See, I’m someone who comes from games like Skyrim and Baldur’s Gate. I’m pretty familiar with finding quests in RPGs.</p>

<p>Haha.</p>

<p>I think I spent about ten minutes running around trying to figure out who would pay me to do things, until I ran into someone’s house and saw a bowl of food. I figured, “Hey, nobody’s here, and I need to eat!” So <em>I did</em>.</p>

<p>Upon immediately turning around, there’s a guy staring at me, and you can probably guess what happened next.</p>

<p>I was back in the pillories.</p>

<p>Another day later, I’m notified that if I commit another crime, I’ll be marked by an executioner or something, and that my character is fed up.</p>

<p>I put my clothes back on and head back into town again, hoping that maybe <em>this time</em> I’ll find some work. I wander around for a bit, and almost get hit with multiple trespassing charges.</p>

<p>It’s at this point that I’m getting kind of tired with my bumbling self almost, or completely breaking the law. I ran all the way out of town into the woods, and fell asleep in some abandoned camp under a bunch of trees. Finally, I was fully healed, and eating an apple out of my pocket.</p>

<p>Yeah. I had food in my pockets that I forgot about.</p>

<p>But now it was night time and pitch black. I’m warned about carrying a torch, in that, it’s a crime if I don’t have one. Another crime!</p>

<p>So I ran. I ran and ran directly into more woods, until I stumbled upon another small village. Nobody’s around. Perfect chance to … steal a horse! Which, was pretty easy, but I’m assuming that because it was dark, nobody saw me!</p>

<p>I decided for myself that my quest was to find my dog, so I road off into the dark again. Fell off the horse a few times, got back on. Eventually, after fumbling with my map and not being able to see where I’m going, I make it to where my dog is supposed to be, and I’m stopped by some guy.</p>

<p>I killed that guy, and took all his money.</p>

<p>Then I found 125 moneys in a pot under another tree by a rock.</p>

<p>With my dog still missing, I figured I’d run around the lake and at least see if … I can find anymore dead bodies with loot.</p>

<p>No such luck.</p>

<p>I run into a pack of wild dogs, and after about three minutes of flailing my sword around, I am dead.</p>

<p>And back at the village that I ran away from.</p>

<p>The game is pretty cool so far! I’ve definitely been experiencing some sort of deliverance, that’s for sure. Delivering my own self into pillories and death.</p>

<p>We’ll see how it goes next time I load it up.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="kingdom-come" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been spending a couple of days sprucing up my site, adding things to the feed, making it more like … a social media feed, and then I got myself a copy of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

It’s a pretty useless app, now, but there are at least some ideas for things to write about. Although, I’m <em>almost certain</em> there are probably easier ways to get daily writing prompts in order to fuel my need to write things. Never-the-less, today’s prompt is all about just … describing your dream home. As a millennial, this is a pipe-dream. A far-away thing that will likely never happen. But, if I could <em>somehow</em> have a home, that I own, what would it be, really?</p>

<p>There is, <em>of course</em>, the old haunted house I lived in when I was sixteen, that I’ve always thought would be <em>really cool</em> to buy, and then renovate, and take care of. But, it’s not really my <em>dream</em> home. It’s more like, a link to the past that I could actively live inside of, as if that would provide some level of comfort as the past, and the way things used to be, gets further and further away from me.</p>

<p>It would make me think of things like, hanging out the window in my room late at night smoking a cigarette. Sitting in front of my hand-me-down 486 choosing a cool anime wallpaper for my desktop. My highschool girlfriend picking me up for school in her jalopy of a car, and the one time I accidentally sleepily dialed 911 when I was trying to call her (to ask how far away she was).</p>

<p><em>That was one hell of a morning, having an ambulance outside wondering what the shit was happening, and my Dad outside, just as confused.</em></p>

<p>Maybe … maybe, it wouldn’t be <em>that</em> great of an idea to live in a place that makes me think of things, and the ways I was, that will never be, ever again. I learned that a couple of months ago when I wrote to that aforementioned highschool ex-girlfriend, and sort of poured out my feelings and thoughts as to why I couldn’t be just some side-thing, like she wanted, twenty years after abandoning what I thought would be the rest of my life, at the time.</p>

<p>She didn’t answer.</p>

<p>And that’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>So, if we’re talking a <em>real</em> dream home, I think I’d go out somewhere, maybe in the midwest, far away from the bustle of <em>other people</em>. I’d go out into the woods and drop down maybe two shipping containers, and I’d have them conditioned for living. There’d be water nearby, so that I could fish whenever I want, and I’d have a studio for gaming and working on all the things that I do on a daily basis. The outside would be covered in camouflage nets and black paint, and the inside would be a sort of … rustic gothic.</p>

<p>Sword collections, a battle-axe over a side table. Another shelf on the opposite side of the living area showcasing all the little game and anime figures I’ve collected over the years. In the center, a gigantic flat-screen television and whatever the latest and best console is.</p>

<p>The kitchen would be a wood-burning stove with ventilation connected to the outside, but there’d also be a modern fridge with temperature display and voice-activated features. But all the smart tech in my home would be running on a reverse proxy that redirects their tracking software to some other location.</p>

<p>The bathroom would have one of those rich-person walk-in showers that you just kind of, stand in while water falls on top of you in kind of an open concept where the sink and toilet are just kinda, right there, <em>also</em>.</p>

<p>But, there’d be a more private bathroom tucked at the back of the master, and <em>only</em> bedroom. Of course, the bed itself would be made out of top-of-the-line memory foam and down-feather sheets or whatever, and there’d be a gigantic glass window in the ceiling that looks out into the stars at night.</p>

<p>Maybe it’d be smart, so I could dim it, or blend it with the ceiling during the day.</p>

<p>There would be a security system surrounding the property, and all of this would be connected to a secondary PC in my studio, with alarms, and footage that’s all saved to my home server, that’d be tucked away in a large walk-in closet. A home server that also has built-in custom water-cooling, and the best of the best technology. That all runs on Linux, <em>of course</em>.</p>

<p>The front door, and the <em>only</em> door, would be reinforced steel, along with the paneling on the outside. Indestructible and impervious to most things, including bullets, and maybe even a grenade.</p>

<p>Then, the best kept secret of my home, would be the bunker beneath all of it, filled with perishables, water, and whatever amenities one might need in the event that <em>something</em> happens. Zombies, nukes, the Night of the Walking Entitled Rich People, whatever. I’ll be ready.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t have a car. I wouldn’t need it. There’d be a secure mailing box at the edge of the woods where my actual address would be, and I’d just order whatever I need, at all times. Imagine ordering a burger on Doordash and you’re like, “Just drop it off at the big huge box on the side of the road.”</p>

<p>And maybe … <em>that</em> could be a dream home. A dream home that’s also future-proof, and ready for disaster.</p>

<p>Maybe it sounds like a prepper’s dream, and that’s kinda funny, cause I’m not really a doomsday prepper. But, if I <em>had the money</em>, maybe I <strong>would</strong> be. Who knows!</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="WritingPrompt" /><category term="writing-prompt" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I’m taking a prompt from the old Jetpack app that I’ve had installed on my phone ever since I still ran a Wordpress blog.

Not to say that software and technology in the 90s were perfect. But, it was a different time. So, short of installing a Windows 95 partition on your PC, how can you make its iconic startup sound play on-boot, and <em>on</em> Linux?</p>

<p>Easy.</p>

<p>Download the chime, <a href="/files/win_95.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>, first, and save it somewhere like, maybe, your “Music” folder.</p>

<p>Now, open your terminal and install MPV.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt install mpv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’re done doing that, you’re going to want to make a new shell script.</p>

<p>So, do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>nano startup.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then, in the text editor (I use Nano, but you can use whatever you want), type this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash
cd /home/$User(whatever your username is)/Music
mpv win_95.mp3
exit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, hit CTRL + O to save and then CTRL + X to exit.</p>

<p>Finally, type in:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>chmod +x startup.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your computer is <em>almost</em> ready to play the Windows 95 chime whenever you startup your PC. But, we’re not quite there, yet!</p>

<p>Now, I’m on Pop!_OS, and your way of accessing this <em>may</em> be different, but you’re going to want to open “Startup Application Preferences.” If, for some reason, this <em>isn’t</em> installed, you can do that.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install gnome-startup-applications
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To open it, at least on <em>my</em> machine, I just hit the Super key (Windows key), and type “Startup,” and then I click the result once it’s shown in the Applications menu.</p>

<p>Now, click “Add” in the window, and give the startup application a name, like, “Win95” or something. Click the “Browse” button and find your shell script, and select it. Once you’ve done that, just click “Add,” and you’re done!</p>

<p>Restart that beautiful PC, and listen.</p>

Dexter: Original Sin season 1 is over!  After watching the final episode, and confirming to myself that Dexter hasn’t been this good since <em>at least</em> season four of the original show, I think there’s one <em>real</em> question that needs to be answered: Is Dexter’s foster father, Harry Morgan, the <em>main</em> villain? In order to answer that question, we have to look at this through the same kind of window in which we viewed the plot of Breaking Bad.</p>

<p>And, we need to keep in mind the title of the newest show, “Original Sin.” <em>Who’s sin?</em> Dexter’s? Or, more directly, Harry’s?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/dexter-harry/Screenshot from 2025-02-15 20-13-52.png" /></p>

<p>In a society where healthcare is for-profit, and, <em>sometimes</em>, a life or death situation, is it bad to become a criminal in order to pay for your cancer treatment?</p>

<p>Obviously, I wouldn’t blame someone for robbing a bank, or selling drugs in order to pay for treatment that could save their lives. It’s the <em>actions</em> that Walter White takes, and the things that he does, that <em>make</em> him the antagonist.</p>

<p>Walter White was a product of his own selfishness and violent desire.</p>

<p>But, Dexter … Dexter is a <em>completely different</em> beast, as a character.</p>

<p>In a <em>corrupt</em> and unjust society, where killers and predators walk free, is it <em>bad</em> to kill them <em>yourself?</em></p>

<p>This question is something I’ve thought about ever since I started watching the OG Dexter series in 2008. <em>Everyone</em> says that what Dexter does in the show is <em>bad</em>, but, is it? Is it <em>really</em>?</p>

<p>As a fictional character, he, for sure, goes off the rails a bit and his “code” slips. There are ways in which he becomes and <em>acts</em> like just a normal, everyday serial killer (and we’ll explore further down if this is part of his <em>own</em> inclinations, or sins of the father). But, for the most part, his actions in both of these shows are things that are shown to have <em>saved</em> lives. So, I guess it circles back to the real world line of thinking that a lot of liberals hold, in that if you enact evil against evil, <em>you are evil</em>.</p>

<p>Which … I don’t believe.</p>

<p>If you punch a Nazi in the face, you don’t <em>become</em> a Nazi. This isn’t the Marvel universe. We don’t have some magical transference of energy that occurs when you hit someone hard enough.</p>

<p>If Dexter kills a child predator who buries his victims under a shed, he doesn’t somehow <em>become</em> a child predator. Unlike Walter White, Dexter doesn’t unconsciously “absorb” pieces of his victims into his <em>own</em> personality.</p>

<p>Dexter does what Dexter does. He uses police resources to investigate killers, collects evidence, and then dumps them in the ocean. And then he goes home with a splotch of blood on a slide, and eats a sandwich.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/dexter-harry/Screenshot from 2025-02-15 20-30-06.png" /></p>

<p>But, we can’t really piece together a full canvas out of these things, unless we also look at the person who <em>made</em> Dexter.</p>

<p>The man who sees himself as a <em>hero</em>, who <em>saved</em> Dexter from becoming something much more along the lines of a monster, like his own brother, Brian Moser. I am, obviously, talking about the character, Harry Morgan.</p>

<p>Walter White and Harry Morgan are more alike than Walter and Dexter.</p>

<p>Both operate out of selfishness, out of a need for vengeance, for their own twisted version of justice, and both are men of tragedy, who see themselves <em>outside</em> of social norms out of a sense of immense pride, immense, inflated egos. Where a regular person would concede, that if they don’t do their job properly, as a cop, killers might get away. Or, in Walter’s respect, a normal person would just take help from their rich friends in order to pay for cancer treatment.</p>

<p>And, in <em>both</em> shows, these men are framed in a way that make the audience sympathize with them, which, in turn, makes it <em>harder</em> to see that the person you’re empathizing with is actually committing some pretty heinous crimes. Because, if there’s any way to get groups of people to excuse bad things, it’s to appeal to their sympathy, and put them in the shoes of those who do bad things.</p>

<p>Because most people are capable of empathy.</p>

<p>Harry is a man who adopted a child from the scene of a murder, of a woman with whom he had an affair, and then molded someone he <em>believed</em> to have inclinations toward murder, into his own “arm of the law.” In order to enact justice against those who escape it.</p>

<p>In his own way, Harry is just another killer. He just can’t pull the trigger himself. In his own selfishness, he creates the anti-monster, out of a child who, and I can’t stress this enough, <em>may not have even ended up that way, as an adult</em>.</p>

<p>That’s right. There is <em>nothing</em> in any of the shows that currently exist that suggest Dexter would have <em>definitely</em> become a stone-cold, regular serial killer. Sure, he committed small-time acts of violence as a child, and through prodding from his foster father, he grew to believe that he had “urges” that needed to be “satisfied.”</p>

<p>When you’re a child, your parents <em>create you</em>. Everything you know, do, and believe, is a product of how you were raised. Harry Morgan <em>knew</em> that, as a very young child, witnessing murder <em>could</em> lead someone to <em>become</em> antisocial, a “psychopath” later in life, and therefore <em>more</em> inclined to <em>be</em> a predator (the idea that someone can be <em>diagnosed</em> as a psychopath, and then also be considered inclined toward murder and violence is definitely something of a topic of contention, but this post isn’t about that). He didn’t <em>know</em> for sure that this is what would happen to Dexter. And yet, he <em>imprinted</em> this idea upon him.</p>

<p>Dexter is a victim of his own upbringing.</p>

<p>Harry Morgan is a man of tragedy. He’s a man who lost his first son to an accidental drowning. He lost the woman he had an affair with, and then he lost his <em>actual wife</em> to sickness. He’s a man who failed to be a <em>good</em> officer of the law on numerous occasions (if such a thing <em>can</em> exist), and it is through that failure, that Dexter was born.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not saying for sure that either Dexter or Harry are definitively <em>good</em> people. These ideas of “good” and “bad” in this sense are meaningless.</p>

<p>But Harry is only two steps from fitting within the moral code he gave his own son, so that he could be an ethical, and unseen, serial killer.</p>

<p>Think of Harry the same way you think of Jigsaw. Jigsaw isn’t a <em>traditional</em> killer. He never pulled a single trigger, or used any knives. He never <em>directly</em> ended anyone’s lives, himself. Jigsaw created the machinations that would do the killing <em>for him</em>, the same way Harry Morgan <em>created</em> a weapon that could kill, undetected, and <em>above the law</em>, without ever having to pull a trigger, himself. Jigsaw’s bear trap is to Harry Morgan what Dexter, <em>is.</em></p>

<p>Jigsaw is a villain.</p>

<p>Harry Morgan … is a villain.</p>

<p>The next question is, “Can a villain have good intentions?”</p>

<p>Or, “What <em>is</em> a villain?”</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Dexter" /><category term="dexter" /><category term="tv" /><category term="media" /><category term="fiction" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, this is it!

Maybe for some, this is a net positive, or you just don’t care either way. For me, I feel like I have enough to fill my time that missing Call of Duty and Valorant isn’t all that much of a thought. But, these things aside, some of the studios behind these games deploy an especially egregious type of anti-cheat via the kernel.</p>

<p>If you ask me, using the kernel as a method of stopping cheaters should be illegal. I mean, just look at this thread over on <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/1592979-whats-the-worst-that-can-happen-with-kernel-level-anti-cheat-in-games-if-one-already-took-these-following-steps/" target="_blank">Linus Tech Tips</a> where users are talking about how safe it is to <em>have</em> this kind of thing invading your PC, and what you can do to protect your data. Some suggest going so far as to having <em>nothing but your games</em> on said PC.</p>

<p>That is … <em>fuckin’ nuts</em>.</p>

<p>No gamedev studio should have that much control, whether it <em>actually</em> stops cheaters, or not (and whether it’s really all that effective is legitimately up-in-the-air).</p>

<p>But … it happens anyway. Do we blame the cheaters? Partially. But, we <em>also</em> have to blame the studio and the developers, or, maybe even the publishers, too. And maybe even a little bit of the blame should go to streaming platforms, and sweaty streamers, who have solidified this <em>idea</em> that you can get rich streaming Fortnite and Call of Duty. An idea that has inadvertently skyrocketed the seriousness of online competitive gaming.</p>

<p>Do you remember back in 1999 when the worst that happened to cheaters in Quake 2 was that they’d just get a permaban from a server? Pepperidge Farm remembers. And do you know how those cheaters were detected?</p>

<p>… the admins of a server would just actually watch footage and make the decision themselves.</p>

<p>A wild got-dang concept.</p>

<p>All of these things combined, though, have created an atmosphere where cheating must be stopped, <strong>has to be stopped</strong>, <em>at all costs</em>, even if it disadvantages you, the player, who’s just trying to chill, and have a good time. Because there’s no elementary school lesson more ingrained in our society, than punishing everyone for the actions of a few.</p>

<p>You can see an example of this, where a studio didn’t even deploy kernel level measures. They just <em>dropped support</em> for Steam’s Proton, and booted <em>all</em> Linux users from their player-base in a move to “stop cheaters”. Yep, I’m talking about <a href="https://www.indiatodaygaming.com/news/story/respawn-cuts-linux-support-for-apex-legends-in-bold-move-to-stop-cheaters-5684" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>. Because, it’s not like anyone on Windows is using software hacks and cheats, it’s those <em>pesky Linux users</em>. It’s gotta be, what, with their custom window managers and desktop environments! Argh!</p>

<p>I just love when a studio decides to punish millions of potential customers and players, because someone who’s bad at games uses the same operating system as the rest of them.</p>

<p>I guess we’ll just ignore the fact that Windows is a hot-bed of spyware, bloat, and also cheats and scammers!</p>

<p>Anyway, this pretty much brings me to why I’m even writing this today.</p>

<p>I didn’t even know, until now, that FromSoftware was releasing another title, but now I do.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank">Elden Ring NightReign</a> comes out on May 30th, as some kind of … standalone Elden Ring co-op title. I don’t really understand the need for this, because, why not just have it be an expansion to the <em>actual</em> Elden Ring? But, apparently, they redesigned the mechanics … or something.</p>

<p>That’s not what I really want to write about.</p>

<p>The issue, is that ERNR will, <em>allegedly</em>, be deploying … <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-in-may-will-have-kernel-level-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">kernel level anti-cheat</a>.</p>

<p>You’re probably thinking, “Why the FUCK do they need something like that, in a <em>co-op game</em>?”</p>

<p>Your guess is as good as mine, dude.</p>

<p>I mean, cheaters <em>are</em> a little rampant in Souls-like FromSoftware games. Corrupting files, becoming invincible, and so on, and so forth. And FromSoft has sort of a track record of questionable bans, where anyone who even so much as <em>accidentally</em> joins a session with a cheater, <em>could end up being banned, themselves</em>.</p>

<p>So … we’re just going to have to deal with this new title, and maybe even possibly <em>future</em> FromSoftware titles utilizing a method of anti-cheat that, again, <em>should be illegal</em> … because, we just can’t figure out how to make our games hacker proof, without tampering with every single user’s system, violating their privacy, making their data vulnerable, and also effectively barring Linux and Steam Deck users from playing our game.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Seems logical.</p>

<p>Seems like I just won’t buy anymore FromSoftware games, huh. Just like I’ll never load up Apex Legends again, and Call of Duty is a distant memory that I’ll only touch if its on a console.</p>

<p>Maybe ten years down the line when we have a government interested in regulations, we can see something being done about this. Or, maybe Microsoft, as much as I <em>hate</em> them, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206719/microsoft-windows-changes-crowdstrike-kernel-driver" target="_blank">will solve the problem themselves</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Linux" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="linux" /><category term="anticheat" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you recently abandoned, or maybe even never used Windows, you might be like me, in that, you don’t get to play the likes of Fortnite, or especially games like Valorant, and Call of Duty.
