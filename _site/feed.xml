I also detailed how this was a bad move, because Buffer is using OpenAI tech in their backend, and even though they <em>say</em> it‚Äôs just an option you can utilize with writing posts ‚Ä¶ based on how OpenAI has been conducting themselves, I don‚Äôt fully trust <em>any</em> company that thinks it‚Äôs a good idea to use their tech. Regardless, since I run a lot of different social media accounts, and I thought it could make things easier for me, like when I write blog posts, or have new music, I decided to give it a whirl!</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/posts.png" alt="screen from the Buffer website, showcasing organized posts I've made across Mastodon on a calendar." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The website itself is very well organized, you can connect your socials, and it even has a calendar that displays ‚Ä¶ <em>everything</em> you‚Äôve ever posted on your connected accounts, chronologically by time and date (which ‚Ä¶ is actually pretty <em>worrying</em> if you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre using that OpenAI tech ethically), and you can do a few other things. Such as, you can create a ‚Äústart‚Äù page, which is just a rip of Link-tree. The downside, is that creating a Buffer version of Link-tree takes up one of your social connections.</p>

<p>But, how <em>many</em> are you allowed to connect on a free account?</p>

<p>Three.</p>

<p>Or, if you want a page with all your links provided by Buffer, essentially, you can connect <em>two</em> accounts.</p>

<p>So, basically, if you‚Äôre using the free Buffer plan, you may as well not even be there. If you can‚Äôt manage two accounts without the help of some software ‚Ä¶ geez, dude.</p>

<p>Okay, but how much does it cost to upgrade to have <em>more</em> connections.</p>

<p>Short answer: Way to goddang much.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>You can actually opt to start paying them fifteen dollars a month for the three accounts you‚Äôve already connected, and have a few added features. Or, you can connect four accounts for twenty dollars, or five accounts for twenty-five dollars, or ‚Ä¶ a whopping fifty dollars for ten accounts! For a frame of reference, I have around eleven or twelve accounts I use across different networks, some alts, some not-so-much. They say, on the subscription page, that this is all ‚Äúthe most value for an individual creator ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>An <em>individual</em> creator? Paying, fifty dollars a month for ten accounts, <em>as long as you‚Äôre paying on a yearly basis</em>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/value.png" alt="A screenshot from the Buffer website depicting having to paying 600 dollars total, or 50 dollars a month, for the ability to connect 10 accounts to their service." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Bro ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Okay, so <em>obviously</em> this has gotta be some kind of marketing that‚Äôs specifically targeting creators who are <em>already</em> making money from what they do online. For fifty dollars a month, if paid yearly, or <em>sixty dollars</em> on a monthly basis, for <em>ten</em> accounts, you could, instead, subscribe to Apple+ and Netflix, and have some entertainment instead. And then just manage your accounts <em>yourself</em>. All with the added benefit of not potentially feeding everything <em>you‚Äôve ever posted</em> into some OpenAI crap.</p>

<p>Which, take a look at this: Are mentioned <em>multiple</em> times on the publishing and scheduling box.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/ai.png" alt="A screenshot from the Buffer website's publishing window, depicting their AI assistant being mentioned twice just pixels away from each other." />
</center>
<p><br />
‚ÄúUse AI assistant!‚Äù Also, did you want help publishing with the ‚ÄúAI Assistant?‚Äù</p>

<p>Because <em>everyone on social media knows</em> that using AI to generate your words totally doesn‚Äôt make you look like a completely fake tool-bag.</p>

<p>So, instead of using Buffer, I‚Äôve opted to just manage the couple of accounts I use the most ‚Ä¶ <em>myself</em>. No, you guys aren‚Äôt getting fifteen, or twenty, or <em>fifty</em> dollars out of me.</p>

<p>But, I <em>did</em> really like their ‚Äústart page‚Äù link aggregator. And, since they‚Äôre so hyper-vigilant about AI generated plagairism, I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt mind if I just ‚Ä¶ rip out the code of their link page, delete all the link trackers, place the CSS into its own file (because why the hell do you have it on the same page as the content?), rename all the modules to something humorous, enlarge the profile picture, increase the vertical size of the banner gif, change all of the colors, replace their icons with <a href="https://phosphoricons.com" target="_blank">Phosphor</a> icons, and replace their crappy static ‚Äúupdate‚Äù section that doesn‚Äôt even serve clickable links, with ‚Ä¶ A live feed of my blog‚Äôs RSS (courtesy of Brenton Fletcher‚Äôs <a href="https://rss.bloople.net" target="_blank">rss.bloople.net</a>)</p>

<p>See it, here: <a href="https://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/" target="_blank">CMDR Nova‚Äôs Linkgarden</a>.</p>

<p>Buffer version on the left, my version on the right.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/links.png" alt="A screenshot of Buffer's link page versus my link page, styled similar, but also completely different." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>But here‚Äôs the thing, if you <em>really</em> want, or <em>need</em> a page of all of your links that you can easily just hand to someone like a business card, you can <em>build one yourself</em>, or, if you really don‚Äôt have the time, or want to learn HTML and CSS, I can just make it <em>for you</em>. I‚Äôm actually going to put together some examples of what a ‚Äúlinkgarden‚Äù could look like if I made one, and gave it to someone, and provide information on free hosting. Or, hey, maybe I could set that up for people too?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know.</p>

<p>What I <em>do</em> know, is that you don‚Äôt have to pay companies continuously for something that can be made for you in a couple of hours, or that you can make <em>yourself</em> in a couple of hours, and then have <em>full control over</em>. And if you <em>really</em> need automated control of all of your accounts at once, I‚Äôm <em>sure</em> there‚Äôs a better way to do it, than paying some company that‚Äôs gone all-in on AI, six hundred dollars a mother-frikken <em>year</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I put up a post about Bluesky announcing their partnership with cross-posting company, ‚ÄúBuffer‚Äù (Yes, I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs starting to look like I have multiple topics that are an ongoing series on this website).

<p><br />
Over the course of the last year, as I mentioned in my post on here about having to <em>shutdown</em> my city, Neo Machina, in Second Life. It had experienced a few temporary shutdowns before that. During one of those shutdowns, I briefly erected a small near double-parcel sized <em>street</em> of the city, and called it, Neo Machina: The Dredge.</p>

<p>Well, with the sim/homestead shutdown, and it being entirely up in the air if it ever comes back (money is a tight piece of crap), I scoured Second Life for a way to keep <em>something</em> going. Because ‚Ä¶ well, because deleting months, six months, a year or more of work, just didn‚Äôt sit well with me.</p>

<p>So, it‚Äôs back, on a quarter sim. Funnily enough, I have <em>more</em> ‚Äúspace‚Äù to work with, as far as placing objects goes, than I ever did on a homestead. It‚Äôs just a smaller area, which isn‚Äôt all that much of a disadvantage, because now there can be fewer blank spaces or filler. I‚Äôve spent some time rebuilding, and I‚Äôve got the apartments back online, and fully redesigned to be more ‚Ä¶ friendly, to living within. I‚Äôve also restored the 100 land impact limit the apartments had when my homestead was briefly a full region.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt expect everyone, or even <em>anyone</em> to come back. This is probably a pain in the ass to people watching from the outside.</p>

<p>But, I <em>promise</em>. When I find some kind of work, or job, in the tech/web development field, I <em>assure you</em> I‚Äôll be making enough to not even have to <em>think</em> about all of this. And <em>maybe</em> running a city in Second Life really isn‚Äôt all that important to most, or all of people, ever. But it means something <em>to me</em>, and that‚Äôs all that matters.</p>

<p>You can come see the new location, and rebuild, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Androviel/27/72/2005" target="_blank">here</a>. As I‚Äôve said, the apartments are back online and ready to use, but <em>pretty much everything else</em> is still under construction. The only reason I‚Äôm opening it now, because it is at least good enough for eyes to see it.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the course of the last year, as I mentioned in my post on here about having to shutdown my city, Neo Machina, in Second Life.

Am I saying that Twitter has accidentally spawned masses of narcissists? Not really. I don‚Äôt think a website and its use for over a decade can alter someone‚Äôs brain chemistry. Or ‚Ä¶ can it?</p>

<p>But this is more about Bluesky, because, yes, again, we are seeing some undue angst and toxicity being slung toward the federated social network revolving around ActivityPub, or more exclusively, Mastodon, <em>because a lot of these people don‚Äôt know about</em> and <em>don‚Äôt care to</em> discover the rest of it. I‚Äôve seen this happen <em>pretty much</em> every other day since Twitter had its last excursion, and then the more recent Brazilian excursion. People, basically, celebrating what they themselves believe to be a <em>better</em> platform, and for all intents and purposes, they can do that (even if that platform is a corporate owned entity no better than Twitter)! But, for whatever reason, it‚Äôs <em>always</em> followed by also dunking on people who are minding their own business on the Fediverse. For ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Reasons!</p>

<p>I want to preface this with something, before I dive into the biggest offenses I‚Äôve seen: I was invited to join Bluesky back when the doors were still closed. Back when it was still an exclusive club, and being more familiar with Mastodon, than Bluesky, I was pretty used to ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs say, people kinda more actually giving a shit about what they say, when they say it, and how they address others. Much to my dismay, I quickly learned that this is <em>not</em> the average Bluesky experience. Because I didn‚Äôt save any screenshots from when it happened, and I don‚Äôt feel like reliving every intricacy of what exactly went on, I‚Äôll be brief, and explain as simply as possible what took place.</p>

<p>I started following people in and adjacent to the LGBTQ+ community, and, as you know, some people like to post with complete abandon, and zero regard. A ‚Äúpopular‚Äù account, attached to a, then, popular block and mute list creator, used a slur to describe people like her, and people like me, openly, just right on the timeline. Feeling kind of jolted by this, and largely due-in-part to some trauma I‚Äôve had in the past, I asked if it was completely necessary to do that. Or, if some kind of warning could‚Äôve happened (no, I am not talking about the word ‚ÄúQueer‚Äù, just so we‚Äôre straight on that).</p>

<p>This was, apparently, <em>not the right thing to ask</em>.</p>

<p>It was my first <em>week</em> on Bluesky, and I was dogpiled, I was harassed, I was <em>mocked</em> for being traumatized by past events that I had no control over, because of who I was, and how I presented myself to the world (you know, instances of events where harm did, or could have come upon my person).</p>

<p>I had multiple users jump <em>directly</em> into my notifications to make sure I knew that <em>nobody cares</em> about how I feel, about my <em>feelings</em>, and that my experiences mean nothing. That I am alone, and I have to deal with it myself, while others speak, and do as they please.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, I was a mess around this point. I was kind of ‚Ä¶ reeling. Flashbacks, trauma, anxiety; Feeling like I‚Äôd just joined a social network absolutely <em>full</em> of sociopaths.</p>

<p>Flash forward a year, and both of those original accounts have been pushed off of the website, because, you guessed it: They‚Äôre both abusive people that were given too much benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have guessed.</strong></p>

<p>Now: Could I have avoided all of this by just <em>unfollowing</em> the offending account or accounts? Sure. But also I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a lot to ask that people take harmful things, and put them behind a warning. Which is something that usually happens on Mastodon, because, I guess, a larger number of Mastodon users care about other people more than your average Bluesky user?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea to generalize a whole website of people. But! Impressions were made, and <em>set</em>.</p>

<p>Now, here we are today. Another gaggle of people rejoicing at the growth Bluesky is experiencing due to X being banned in Brazil. Which is good! A website that is owned and operated by a corporate entity, and sponsor, <em>needs</em> growth in order to eventually make money. And, like clockwork, with all of that <em>also</em> comes the random dunking of people who use a much older federated network, that‚Äôs been around since the internet took off. You already know what I‚Äôm talking about, so we‚Äôll just dive right into this, again (I posted about this on my Mastodon account, but I feel like it needed more picking apart).</p>

<center>
<img alt="an image where a Bluesky user asserts that compiling a Linux kernel is easier than joining Mastodon" src="/img/posts/busky3/kernal_hard.png" />
</center>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As a lot of people who read what I write here probably already know, I‚Äôm <em>very</em> passionate about the deconstruction of centralized social media, and the corporate internet. So much so, that I have two machines that run Linux, one that runs MacOS, and none that run Windows. Most of my online activity is on some <em>kind</em> of open-source software, and the corporate tech I <em>do</em> interact with is ‚Ä¶ limited, and usually only for the benefit of what I create, or compose, or make.</p>

<p>Now, I <em>use</em> Linux, and I am by no means a Linux genius, so when I see someone talking about compiling a Linux kernel, I‚Äôm not entirely sure how they‚Äôd accomplish that. I‚Äôve never done it, nor ever considered it. But! I am under the impression that you <em>need some</em> knowledge of the C programming language, and its compilers.</p>

<p>Imagine saying that you need a degree in computer science to choose a Mastodon instance, and to make sure you‚Äôre choosing one with a competent moderation policy, and fully meaning that, wholeheartedly, with a straight face. And to say that in response to someone, <em>basically</em> saying that, your onboarding process for a social network needs to be entirely smooth, without friction, or people will immediately abandon it and just give their data back to their corporate overlords.</p>

<p>I <em>don‚Äôt want</em> to believe that a mass majority of people are so intellectually <em>lazy</em> that they‚Äôd refuse to spend sixty seconds looking at the splash page of a Mastodon instance and going, ‚ÄúHmm. Okay, so they ban nazis and they‚Äôre okay with gay and trans people, awesome!‚Äù I <em>do</em> want to believe that this is just a popular narrative among people who have little specific agendas in mind, but that‚Äôs probably too conspiracy theorist to even begin speaking about.</p>

<p>Like I said in my Mastodon post on this topic, <em>leaving Twitter behind</em> is already creating friction in your social media existence. That a little more is too much, is just ridiculous. People are more happy to jump directly into the arms of another corporation, because all they have to do is write down a username and a password and then forget about it?</p>

<p>Nah, you can‚Äôt be <em>serious</em>, my guy.</p>

<p>But, this all isn‚Äôt even the biggest offense in what‚Äôs essentially a huge thread of people dunking on the fediverse, again, <em>for no reason</em> (I would link to it, but I honestly deactivated my mainline Bluesky account after seeing all of this and I have no interest in visiting their domain, again).</p>

<center>
<img alt="an imagine of two Bluesky users sharing the exasperation with ... being expected to care about other people on the fediverse." src="/img/posts/busky3/empathy_hard.png" />
</center>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>This</em>. This freakin‚Äô attitude again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOther people‚Äôs feelings aren‚Äôt my problem! I don‚Äôt care about THEM?! GOD.‚Äù</p>

<p>Do you know how difficult it is to push the ‚ÄúCW‚Äù button on Mastodon, and then type your post?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not hard.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also not hard to consider other people when you‚Äôre going about your daily life and making decisions.</p>

<p><em>It is not hard</em>. You cannot convince me that it is.</p>

<p>All this continued attitude from Bluesky proves to me, is that Mastodon users ‚Ä¶ somehow care <em>more</em> about the people around them, than <em>maybe</em> your average user on Bluesky. Which is fucked up. Because the Fediverse has its own issues with nazi instances cropping up at random, and abusive people block evading, and so on, and so forth. But to <em>think</em> it‚Äôs a DUNK, that on Bluesky, you‚Äôre <em>not expected</em> to express empathy for others.</p>

<p>Guys.</p>

<p>Guys, I think I‚Äôm gonna barf into my shoes, and then piss my pants.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm just <em>utterly</em> confused about how we‚Äôve gotten to this point. <em>to this crossroads</em>, where two different websites are having fights with each other, and one of the <em>main</em> points of argument is that ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too hard to care about other people.</p>

<p>I dunno, fellas, maybe I was right in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I don‚Äôt really want much to do with Bluesky, and I‚Äôm <em>sure</em> there are perfectly normal and perfectly fine people on the website. But, for the past <strong>year</strong> this has been a trend, an attitude, that I have <em>only seen</em> coming from Bluesky.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs a red flag.</p>

<p>A continuous, never-ending red flag, that just keeps waving and waving.</p>

<p>I <em>can‚Äôt wait</em> for the ‚ÄúI deleted my Bluesky account today‚Äù posts that will inevitably begin cropping up across the Fediverse. Because, federated social media and the federated internet, <em>is the future</em>, whether Jay at BSKY wants to acknowledge it, or not.</p>

<p>You remember a while back when <a href="/gaming/2024/05/22/pools">I wrote that post on POOLS</a> about how awesome and good I thought the game was? Well, I got to chapter two around that time, and decided to stop playing for a while. Not because the game was <em>bad</em> or anything, but just because it gets under you skin way too easily. Eventually, though, I <em>had</em> to come back, and I <em>had</em> to complete it.</p>

<p>And that I did.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pools2/2.png" alt="image of another pool room that's shrouded in darkness, with larger than life mannequin heads jutting from the floor, mouths open" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to spoil a bunch of stuff here, but I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs okay, because Backrooms related games and media are kinda niche, and when it comes to horror, this is especially niche.</p>

<p>Usually, when I tried to play this game, I would do it late at night, in complete silence ‚Ä¶ for some <em>reason</em>. And that made it pretty hard to work my way through. Don‚Äôt even get me started on The Complex: Expedition. Despite its harmless entity (that I know of), I find that game <em>just</em> as terrifying.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs all the low humming, the scratches, the howling of dark wind in an endless tunnel.</p>

<p>But I did it.</p>

<p>I pushed through, with my pinky on the shift key, the entire time.</p>

<p>There were freaky moments. Funny moments. And sometimes, awe-inspiring moments.</p>

<p>And then it came to an end, with the silent protagonist setting their camera down upon a table, mannequins encroaching upon you from one of two paths behind you, and another arm holding a door open. But then the view cuts to a recording, the door shuts, and whoever‚Äôs viewing the tape of your actions hits the stop button, and credits roll.</p>

<p>Pretty <em>confusing</em>, right?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think so.</p>

<p>Throughout POOLS, there is a lot of imagery. It‚Äôs, of course, <em>based</em> on the Backrooms. And the pool rooms <em>are</em> a level known in the liminal maze. Some may also know it as Sublimity (you also get a glimpse of the actual Backrooms in POOLS, along with some other pieces of levels dreamed up by the fandom, such as Eternal Suburbia). The developers though, they only say it‚Äôs <em>based</em> on the Backrooms, and I think I understand why we‚Äôre making that distinction here. Because it <em>is</em> the backrooms, but it‚Äôs also something else.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a work of art.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs purgatory.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pools2/4.png" alt="image of a hallway that doesn't look at all unlike the actual backrooms" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs an allegory for abuse, and the victim of that abuse <em>fighting to escape it</em>, and <em>failing</em>. Fighting in isolation, and trauma, reminded at every turn what they did to you, and when there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel and you think you‚Äôre finally out of the never-ending spiral, <em>it goes out</em> and disappears. And then the darkness pulls you back in.</p>

<p>Where does this inkling come from, though? Some have already said that they believe this to be an allegory for such things. That this <em>has</em> to be about abuse, or <em>something</em>. I think someone even mentioned they thought it was about CSA, due to some depictions of a child‚Äôs drawings on the walls, big black letters scrawled across a picture that reads, ‚ÄúNOTHING,‚Äù a single lonely house that appears to you toward the end, and then endless copies of it, and the appearance of very large mannequins screaming, viewing other mannequins in compromising, embarrassing positions, pointing, staring, mouth-agape in horror.</p>

<p>Whatever <em>type</em> of abuse it is, I think this game is definitely telling a story, whether real or fiction, and it‚Äôs all right in front of you the whole time.</p>

<p>The innocent rubber ducks sitting around in the water that are somehow <em>terrifying</em>. The pool slides that seem to be in random places that beg to be jumped into, as absurd as that is, while you‚Äôre lost in a horrifying complex.</p>

<p>The mixture of innocence, and despair.</p>

<p>Of lightheartedness, and terror.</p>

<p>POOLS takes something that really has no meaning, other than to terrify, and turns it into something that has ‚Ä¶ a very <em>deep</em> message. Something you have to decode <em>yourself</em>, or not. It‚Äôs entirely up to the player, I think. And that‚Äôs one more thing that just makes this game <em>so good</em>.</p>

<p>I could be <em>entirely wrong</em>, though, and this could be one of many ways to interpret the game. And that‚Äôs okay. Because POOLS isn‚Äôt <em>just</em> a game, it‚Äôs a work of art, and it asks that you experience it. Nothing more.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NaNoWriMo Weaponizes Social Justice Language in Endorsement of AI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/02/nanowrimo-weaponizes-social-justice-language-in-endorsement-of-ai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NaNoWriMo Weaponizes Social Justice Language in Endorsement of AI" /><published>2024-09-02T11:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-02T11:32:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/02/nanowrimo-weaponizes-social-justice-language-in-endorsement-of-ai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/02/nanowrimo-weaponizes-social-justice-language-in-endorsement-of-ai.html"><![CDATA[<p>It‚Äôs the second day of my little tiny vacation, and I‚Äôve woken up at the bright and early hour of 11 in the morning. I log onto social media to check my notifications and see what‚Äôs happening, and ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm immediately alerted that those behind NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) <a href="https://nanowrimo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/29933455931412-What-is-NaNoWriMo-s-position-on-Artificial-Intelligence-AI?ref=404media.co" target="_blank">have endorsed using theft-machines (AI) to generate books and stories</a>, while weaponizing social justice language in order to emotionally manipulate their readers and writers.</p>

<p>404 Media wrote a fairly neutral article on the matter that doesn‚Äôt appear to take any position whatsoever, but I‚Äôm <a href="https://www.404media.co/nanowrimo-ai-policy-classist-ableist/" target="_blank">linking them here</a> anyway, in order to contextualize <em>who</em> NaNoWriMo was, and is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NaNoWriMo started as a group writing project in the ‚Äò90s with the goal of writing a 50,000-word manuscript in one month (November), but in 2005, NaNoWriMo became a nonprofit organization that takes donations and runs fundraising campaigns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, let‚Äôs now take a look at their reasoning, and then tear those reasons to shreds. I‚Äôll be calling NaNoWriMo ‚ÄúNNW‚Äù from here on out in this post, just because it‚Äôs easier to type than an abbreviation with annoying capitalization.</p>

<p>NNW says that condemning AI in writing is classist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all writers have the financial ability to hire humans to help at certain phases of their writing. For some writers, the decision to use AI is a practical, not an ideological, one. The financial ability to engage a human for feedback and review assumes a level of privilege that not all community members possess.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs true that, as writers and authors who don‚Äôt have access to thousands of dollars, <em>it can be</em> a hard time getting outside opinions and help on your writing. But, here‚Äôs the thing: You can still write a story, or a novel, without using machines that rip off <em>other authors</em> in order to edit and proofread (if you can call feeding your work into an LLM ‚Äúediting‚Äù and ‚Äúproofreading‚Äù). As an independent author, myself, I have <em>friends</em>, and sometimes I‚Äôll conscript them to give me some opinions on what I‚Äôve written. I also <em>extensively</em> comb over my writing (now, at least) when I‚Äôm putting a book together. Hence the reason it‚Äôs been taking me well over a year to make progress on my next book, Dissolution Protocol. I want to make something <em>really good</em>.</p>

<p>And it takes a lot of practice, and time, to become effective at spotting errors and issues in your own writing.</p>

<p>But here‚Äôs the thing: That‚Äôs fine! What‚Äôs the rush? The act of creating art is and always has been a slow-burn process of practicing, learning, and both failure and success. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that! That‚Äôs how art <em>is</em>! And introducing AI into the matter <em>cuts that out completely</em>. <em>All of it</em>.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs not to mention all of the other resources available to independent writers and authors. Join a discussion forum of writers and readers! Post snippets! There are so many online avenues you can use to find help with your writing that <em>don‚Äôt cost you a dime</em>, and you don‚Äôt have to rip off anyone in order to utilize them.</p>

<p>NNW also says that condemning AI in writing is ableist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not all brains have same abilities and not all writers function at the same level of education or proficiency in the language in which they are writing. Some brains and ability levels require outside help or accommodations to achieve certain goals. The notion that all writers ‚Äúshould‚Äú be able to perform certain functions independently or is a position that we disagree with wholeheartedly. There is a wealth of reasons why individuals can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù the issues in their writing without help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, this is the part where they get <em>real manipulative</em>, because now we‚Äôre using disabled people as our reason for saying it‚Äôs totally fine to use these planet-destroying bots to write <em>for you</em> (LLMs are more and more increasingly power hungry, so much so that Microsoft is considering building nuclear reactors to power them, and many current LLMs are burning <em>tons and tons</em> of fossil fuels in order to operate).</p>

<p>Yes, people sometimes need outside accommodations for reading and writing, like <em>screen readers</em>, and special keyboards, and, as I mentioned in my thoughts above, <em>community forums</em> where readers and writers collaborate together to troubleshoot their own work. Saying, ‚Äúnot all brains have the same abilities‚Äù in your endorsement of these machines is exactly how a psychopath would attempt to convince you that cutting off your own hand is beneficial to you, <em>somehow</em>.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, this is what they actually say right at the start of their post on Zendesk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NaNoWriMo does not explicitly support any specific approach to writing, nor does it explicitly condemn any approach, including the use of AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt explicitly support any specific approach to writing, and we don‚Äôt condemn any approach, such as AI, but also, here‚Äôs why we fully endorse using AI.‚Äù</p>

<p>I‚Äôm gonna be real with you, chief. I <em>have</em> used text-based AI. I‚Äôve used it like Google to see if it could answer questions <em>better</em> and <em>faster</em> than a Google search would. Because, despite my grievances with most LLMs, and especially the image-generation machines that are completely and entirely based on theft and disenfranchisement, I don‚Äôt think these things are going anywhere. I think there are <em>some</em> limited uses for text-based AI. Like, you could open up, let‚Äôs say, ChatGPT and say, ‚ÄúHey, what are some writing prompts that might be interesting?‚Äù or, ‚ÄúWhat are some resources I could use to get outside opinions and help on my writing?‚Äù</p>

<p>And sometimes, you do actually get decent answers. <em>I just wouldn‚Äôt trust whatever the hell Google‚Äôs developing.</em></p>

<p>Now, let‚Äôs take a look at their continued opinions in regard to general access issues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All of these considerations exist within a larger system in which writers don‚Äôt always have equal access to resources along the chain. For example, underrepresented minorities are less likely to be offered traditional publishing contracts, which places some, by default, into the indie author space, which inequitably creates upfront cost burdens that authors who do not suffer from systemic discrimination may have to incur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we‚Äôre continuing to emotionally manipulate people by, instead of using disabled people this time, we‚Äôre going to use marginalized people, such as the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, finding an agent is hard. Getting a contract is <em>even harder</em>. In the years I‚Äôve been writing fiction (since 2008), I‚Äôve rebuffed the idea <em>completely</em>. <em>Especially</em> after, more recently, seeing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/byebyejob/comments/1do4w0x/literary_agent_rejects_query_and_asks_someone/" target="_blank">examples of literary agents</a> openly suggesting <em>stealing</em> an author‚Äôs query for themselves.</p>

<p>The world is a vampire. A pimple-infested, gout infected, disease ridden, <em>vampire</em>.</p>

<p>But, with this further explanation of their stance, NNW speaks as though being an ‚Äúindie author‚Äù is <em>not desirable</em>, that it‚Äôs lesser, and I couldn‚Äôt disagree <em>more</em>.</p>

<p>Since I started writing, those who <em>do</em> have contracts, and who <em>do</em> have agents, have always taken to social media to speak like the privileged snobs some of them are. Saying that community-sourced editing and proofreading from authors who take to publishing <em>themselves</em> through avenues like <a href="https://www.smashwords.com/" target="_blank">Smashwords</a>, <em>aren‚Äôt as good</em>, or are ‚Äúlazy.‚Äù That you <em>shouldn‚Äôt</em> pay any attention to an author‚Äôs work, if it isn‚Äôt coming out of one of the big six.</p>

<p>And, sadly, authors utilizing AI to write books <em>for them</em> are only going to make independent publishing <em>that much harder</em>, because the optics around self publishing <em>were already</em> dark, and muddy, partially <em>because</em> of the gate-keeper jerks who speak like this.</p>

<p>You can be an independent author, and you can write a <em>decent</em> story, <em>without</em> using machines that not only <em>steal</em> from other writers, but <em>will absolutely</em> vacuum up the work you feed into it, in order to further compound this problem. And I‚Äôm going to say that again, so that it‚Äôs clear, <em>you should not</em> feed your work into an LLM (an AI), unless you want it <em>stolen</em> from you.</p>

<p>I can only imagine that the reason NNW has taken this stance, is because they <em>must</em> have suddenly received funding from some kind of Silicon Valley venture capital, right?</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Anyway, those are the most important points I wanted to touch on in light of these, frankly, <em>idiotic</em> takes coming from NNW. If you‚Äôre going to endorse AI, you can <em>at least</em> do it without speaking to writers and readers like Hannibal-fucking-Lector, manipulating them into sitting down at the dinner table and prepping <em>their own brain</em> for consumption.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I think it‚Äôs totally fine for people to join if they‚Äôre too bamboozled by the process of a picking an instance on Mastodon, or some other piece of ActivityPub software (even though I still can‚Äôt really fathom just exactly <em>how</em> it seems hard to some).</li>
  <li>The southern division of public policy has a Project 2025 author on its team, and Meta has yet to even remotely acknowledge this to the public. Just exactly how <em>much</em> influence this living turd has on Threads is questionable. For all I know it could <em>only</em> be Facebook (judging by the way Facebook looks nowadays).</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs algorithm is like a drunk person having mood swings, in that, if you even so much as slightly interact with a topic, that‚Äôs the only thing you see for the entire next day.</li>
  <li>And that there are groups of instances on the Fediverse extremely dedicated to not only blocking federation from Threads themselves, but essentially utilizing peer pressure as a weapon in order to get others to do so, as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>On that last point, though, I‚Äôve spoken about the little ‚Äúblack list‚Äù built by veganism.social that basically lists every federated server they can see, and whether or not they‚Äôre blocking Threads (again, peer pressure, and I wish people would stop acting like we‚Äôre all mentally still in high school). I find things like this distasteful. Have your opinion, your feelings, and what you think is right, and <em>stop forcing it onto other people</em>, unless of course we‚Äôre talking discrimination, hate crimes, or what-have-you ‚Ä¶ I mean, <em>obviously</em>, you should make sure people know those things are bad.</p>

<p>But Threads?</p>

<p>Right now I‚Äôm seeing it as kind of a gray area.</p>

<p>There are people on there I haven‚Äôt seen in years, that I was originally following on Twitter. Tons of LGBTQ+ people, and other people I wouldn‚Äôt ever call ‚Äúbad‚Äù. And then, you know, the trolls, weirdos, and one-off accounts, and oh yeah, also, the spam accounts intentionally setup to grift engagement.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm writing this post about, today, though.</p>

<p>Today it‚Äôs about the ethos of ‚Äúembrace, extend, extinguish‚Äù that all started with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1eykup/google_abandons_open_standards_for_instant/" target="_blank">Google and XMPP</a>. Basically, Google integrated its instant messaging protocol with XMPP, and then decided, like they do with every project that isn‚Äôt an immediate groundbreaking successful <em>thing</em>, and backed out. The problem with this, is that Google‚Äôs integration was highly anticipated, and this drew a lot <em>more</em> people to XMPP, and then this also essentially ‚Äúkilled it.‚Äù I don‚Äôt really know if you can say it‚Äôs <em>dead</em>, though, because I literally can see people linking to their own usernames for XMPP on their Mastodon profiles, right now, as I‚Äôm typing this.</p>

<p>The fear revolving around Threads and federation with ActivityPub, is ‚Ä¶ uhm, that people might get <em>too excited</em> about this, and everyone might federate with Threads, and then Threads might pull out and <em>extinguish</em> interest in ActivityPub. That, and Meta isn‚Äôt so great at moderating Threads. But ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really see how that‚Äôs a problem for Mastodon, when as admins and moderators, you can manually silence bad accounts, and <em>you should</em>, regardless of where they‚Äôre coming from. An interesting thing I‚Äôve seen on <a href="https://app.wafrn.net" target="_blank">Wafrn</a>, though, is that the federated Tumblr alternative makes federating with Threads an account-level, opt-in, and I think that‚Äôs actually <em>really genius</em>. The decision should <em>absolutely</em> be in the hands of the user.</p>

<p>But I have some opinions on XMPP and its eventual perceived crash, and whether Meta is copy/pasting what Google did here.</p>

<p>First of all, as much as I <em>loved</em> Aol Instant Messenger, and instant messaging in the nineties ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs dead, guys. I don‚Äôt know about you, or anyone else, but I can <em>hardly</em> find enough interest in Discord and my Steam friends list to keep up with them enough to actively talk to people for long periods of time. I ‚Ä¶ kind of just use social media for that. You know, that thing that started with Myspace and only became bigger until it ruled our entire lives?</p>

<p>Nowadays, I kind of don‚Äôt really like anyone outside of my family having immediate access to me. I‚Äôm reclusive, and I‚Äôm battling things in my head that make it hard for me to break out of my own shell, and you think I‚Äôm going to go out of my way to actively talk to a bunch of people <em>instantly</em> and <em>all of the time</em>.</p>

<p>Nuh uh.</p>

<p>You see, I mean, <em>sure</em>, Google deciding to graveyard federation with XMPP <em>likely</em> harmed it, even if just a little bit. But I think the overarching problem here is just that, instant messaging isn‚Äôt really <em>the thing</em> nowadays, and I think it‚Äôs always kind of been on the way out.</p>

<p>Social media, micro-blogging, you think that‚Äôd go away on the fediverse on the off-chance that Meta kills Threads, or pulls out of ActivityPub?</p>

<p>AP‚Äôs been around since the early 2000s, and yeah, sure, it has this reputation of being a Linux-user‚Äôs heaven, and full of dudes who hate people who make things (like music, art, etc), but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs <em>ever</em> going anywhere. At this point, Twitter is <em>basically</em> the only major platform that isn‚Äôt federated, or touting decentralization, and <em>it‚Äôs dying</em>.</p>

<p>But even in the off-chance that Meta does a select-all and delete on its ActivityPub integration, I think apps like Mastodon would definitely still be standing. Because, as of writing this, plenty of people <em>aren‚Äôt even federating</em> with Threads, and most of the people I see and interact with on the fediverse value a user-owned social network more than anything else on the web. Whether Threads is there or not, for many, is purely inconsequential in the grander scheme of things. And a lot of users on <em>Threads</em> don‚Äôt even know what the hell Mastodon even <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think I have to, but I just want to point out real quick that Mastodon is not a company, and ActivityPub, or, ‚Äúthe fediverse‚Äù, as stated before, has existed for decades. That the Bluesky devs suddenly, just two days ago, decided to call the network of keys accessing their servers ‚Äúthe atmosphere‚Äù is more or less just another way I feel they‚Äôre kind of cherry-picking ideas from a concept that has existed well before they decided they wanted to be Twitter 2.0.</p>

<p>But anyway .. embrace, extend, extinguish, or just fear-mongering, with some legit concerns about corporations, and their goals?</p>

<p>You decide, I suppose.</p>

<p>A lot of what I say about some of these networks might sound negative, or pessimistic, but I really do actually enjoy watching it all shift back and forth. I <em>like</em> that the internet is having a power-struggle to figure out <em>where</em> the ‚Äúplace to be‚Äù is now. Because none of them will win. The ‚Äúplace to be‚Äù is wherever you <em>want</em>, and it should‚Äôve never been <em>just one</em> website, like I sad in my ‚Äúblog day‚Äù post.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‚Äôve written on here before about Threads and how:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Available Today at the Progeny Mall Event!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/second%20life/2024/09/01/available-today-at-the-progeny-mall-event.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Available Today at the Progeny Mall Event!" /><published>2024-09-01T08:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-01T08:42:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/second%20life/2024/09/01/available-today-at-the-progeny-mall-event</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/second%20life/2024/09/01/available-today-at-the-progeny-mall-event.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/img/posts/os95/os95_ad.png" alt="ad card for a set of glitchy windows 95 looking shorts in Second Life" /></p>

<p>For the first time since 2016, [REVOSA] is actively participating in a shopping event! Starting today, the Nano Nexus OS95 Edition shorts are available exclusively, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Progeny/160/116/21" target="_blank">here</a>, and until the end of the month!</p>

  <p>Progeny Mall is an event created by the Progeny team, which helps designers mingle with the Progeny community and showcase their exclusives every month.</p>

<p>The OS95 shorts are part of an ongoing set within my store that I was working on earlier in the year, and had paused for a long period of time. Once picking up the mantle again, after deciding not to drop the ball after the closure of my homestead/sim, I churned out a few new pairs, including <em>this one</em>.</p>

<p>Styled after the aesthetics of the nineties and Windows 95, these shorts are perfect for the weird, the quirky, and the nineties kids, even if only at heart.</p>

It is now 11pm. So, if today <em>was</em> a blog day, I‚Äôve mostly missed it, but that‚Äôs only because I was at work the whole time. Though, I did look at some sources to see if it really is, or was, blog day, on this here August 31st, and the results are ‚Ä¶ confusing?</p>

<p>So, January 17th is sometimes known as National Blogging Day, August 31st is also celebrated as Blog Day, and then September 19th is International Blog Day.</p>

<p>Whether it is, or not, I think it‚Äôs neat to celebrate ‚Äúblogging.‚Äù</p>

<p>For a <em>long period</em> of time in the era of Twitter, I feel like the internet almost <em>lost</em> the idea of blogs and websites. In that respect, maybe Elon Musk did us all a favor, by reminding people that their thoughts and their lives don‚Äôt have to exist and revolve around one website. You can make a website, you can call it your own, and you can have it look any way you want, and you can write on it. And you <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>I talk about this in my ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù slash page, but, I mean, it‚Äôs true?</p>

<p>So you‚Äôre on Threads now, or Bluesky, or Mastodon. What if Threads shuts its doors? What if the devs behind Bluesky run out of resources and they go offline? What if your Mastodon instance goes down and you don‚Äôt notice until months later? This actually happened to me. I signed up on Mastodon.lol and made a bunch of posts, gained a ton of followers ‚Ä¶ and then I had my little relapse back to Twitter for a while. When things started exploding, and the Musk took over, I was like ‚Ä¶ Well, maybe I should go back to Mastodon, again.</p>

<p>Little did I know, the admin shutdown the entire site, but ‚Ä¶ left the domain up. They left the domain up so that they could serve people coming to find their accounts, a gif expressing being mad, or irritated.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs great man. But I want my data?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I eventually launched my <em>own</em> Mastodon instance, and despite having no plans to close it <em>ever</em> (unless by unfortunate circumstance), I <em>still</em> think it‚Äôs a good idea to have your own website, and your own blog. Why?</p>

<p>Mastodon is not held up by infinite resources. Your posts will most likely <em>go away</em> at some point (databases automatically clean things up to make space). The same goes for Nostr, the same goes for Bluesky, I‚Äôm willing to bet. <em>Although, Bluesky isn‚Äôt exactly traditionally decentralized</em>, but people like to say that it is (this is a topic I‚Äôve touched on a few times). And Threads? I mean, for all intents and purposes, it‚Äôll probably be there forever.</p>

<p>But the other thing about traditional social media? You post something, heck, something <em>really</em> good, something that gets a lot of attention, and likes ‚Ä¶ And then a day later it‚Äôs gone. Forgotten about. Lost in the code, like tears in the rain.</p>

<p>On a website, though, you make a decent post that people enjoy, and guess what? It‚Äôs not lost in the sauce. It‚Äôs still <em>right there</em>. And with resources like Neocities and Github, you can host a site, <em>for free</em> without any threat of ever losing anything, <em>because you can keep it all on your hdd</em>, or your favorite cloud service. Back it up to a thumb drive, burn it to thirty CDs (they must be cheap these days, right?), get yourself a floppy drive and put it on some plastic disks. With a website, and a personal blog, your data remains in <em>your own hands</em>. And that‚Äôs what Geocities got right in the nineties.</p>

<p>Corporations wanted to take this from you. They want <em>your data</em> in <em>their</em> hands. Your thoughts, your posts, your ideas, your dreams, <em>all of it</em>, on their <em>own</em> service, where they can use it at will, and <em>sell it</em>. That is eventually what the basis of Twitter became, and it is mostly the basis of every other corporate-owned and backed social media website, save Mastodon. No, I don‚Äôt think Bluesky ultimately has your best interest in mind. I mean, do I have to link to the article I wrote for a third time about their partnership with a company that‚Äôs using OpenAI tech in their software?</p>

<p>Sure, this all isn‚Äôt something that swaths of people care about. You can go on any of these sites right now and see people never having a single thought about their personal data ownership and privacy.</p>

<p>But for those who <em>do</em> think about these things, and care about them, you <em>should</em> have a website, a personal blog. You should have these things, because it‚Äôs not enough to setup shop on Threads and put all of your trust into Meta. You absolutely should not do that.</p>

<p>Those are my thoughts for this particular Blog Day, though. Get <em>away</em> from Twitter, and rebuild, <em>rethink</em> how you use the internet.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I shouldn‚Äôt even really ask the question, ‚ÄúIs today blog day?‚Äù Because the day has passed us by.

And then it stood for a year and eight months. It was my virtual home, my little piece of metaverse space with which I could do whatever I pleased. It wasn‚Äôt just some copy of the older version of Neo Machina that was built by someone else, it was <em>it‚Äôs own thing</em>. And I enjoyed spending time in it.</p>

<p>No, it never really garnered some kind of massive community. Truth be told, I have all of the energy in the world for creating, and making, but almost none of the energy for spending hours, and days trying to entice people to gather, and communicate. It‚Äôs just not my forte. And, I guess, in a way, that‚Äôs partly the reason it‚Äôs gotta close.</p>

<p>But really, the biggest reason is because Linden Labs charges 100-200 dollars a month for a personal ‚Äúserver‚Äù, and then you foot that bill. <em>Willingly</em>. No matter what happens. Meanwhile, you can jump into Minecraft and get yourself a server for like nine bucks a month. I‚Äôm not sure I understand the massive price difference, or what it takes to ‚Ä¶ <em>host</em> digital items on piece of a server that people occupy by connecting, and mostly AFK-ing. I really don‚Äôt get it.</p>

<p>I think it‚Äôs a matter of just, a company deciding how much they think a service is worth, and then hiking the prices up so that it‚Äôs <em>almost</em> out of reach to people who aren‚Äôt swimming in cash.</p>

<p>I apologize to the people <em>who did</em> congregate and live there, though, you know, to get back on topic. Maybe there are other places similar enough, and you can find what you‚Äôre looking for there, instead. I said in the Discord and within the Second Life group: Anyone who currently has time running on rentals within Neo Machina can be reimbursed. All you‚Äôve got to do is contact me (my SL avatar is Nova Ayashi).</p>

<p>I dunno, though. It sucks to see something you poured so much work into <em>maybe</em> actually going away for good. Sure, I‚Äôll recover from the financial losses I went through with my car, and things will be relatively normal again. But, can I <em>really</em> convince myself to pick up 100 dollars a month, for the umpteenth time?</p>

<p>Yeah, I shut Neo Machina down a few times, and then brought it back up. This wasn‚Äôt some show of erratic indecision, but just solely based on ‚Ä¶ money troubles. Having troubles, deciding it‚Äôs best to fix some of that by not paying Linden Labs 100 bucks a month, and then deciding that I couldn‚Äôt let it go. But I think now is probably time to do just that.</p>

<p>I still have a store in Second Life, and now it has a location that‚Äôs completely free of charge, and full of space. And it also has a small, secret, back-up location, <em>just in case</em>. So there‚Äôs that. And my store has always been the <em>most important</em> part of my time in Second Life. It‚Äôs just that ‚Ä¶ <em>owning</em> my own sim (server) in SL, was like, one of my digital dreams, and it looks like after the shutdown on September 1st, I might have to find another way to accomplish that dream.</p>

<p>Unless I find completely different work that pays a bit more than what I‚Äôm making now, <em>or someone decides to sign up on my Ko-fi</em> for like a hundred bucks a month (lol).</p>

<p>Either way, I‚Äôll miss Neo Machina, even if it wasn‚Äôt really a hugely popular spot that hundreds of people visited daily (I don‚Äôt have the resources to build a massive RP zone with intricate systems hosted on servers outside of the virtual world).</p>

<p>Until next time ‚Ä¶ maybe?</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It‚Äôs hard to believe I built a city in Second Life, and spent months, and months, and months putting together one of my biggest projects, ever.

<p>Everyone‚Äôs heard of Tumblr. Most know it for its 2010s fandoms, and sometimes extreme politics. Others know Tumblr for ‚Äúthat place that banned porn, which caused a huge influx of those same fandom loving people to suddenly invade Twitter.‚Äù And then Twitter got bought out by a megalomaniac, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1avbp78/tumblr_bans_trans_woman_over_looney_toonslevel/" target="_blank">then a trans woman made a joke about exploding hammers</a> to the CEO of Tumblr (This isn‚Äôt to say that death threats should be taken lightly, or are never serious, but after reading this I find it hard to even <em>see</em> this as as death threat. Wishing someone were dead, albeit bad, and not something I would personally do, doesn‚Äôt a death threat make.), and then trans people started getting banned on Tumblr, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we‚Äôre at a crossroads, where that same CEO says, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230587/tumblr-move-blogs-wordpress-automattic" target="_blank">‚ÄúAy, we‚Äôre movin‚Äô it to Wordpress.com‚Äù</a>, because they‚Äôve tried <em>so many things</em> to revitalize the platform. Except for ‚Ä¶ just simply reversing the changes made all those years ago <em>that caused</em> people to leave. It wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbanning porn‚Äù, though. They were <em>really</em> attempting to target CSAM, but in the cluster of gunfire, they took out completely innocent blogs, or people who were expressing their adult rights to, well, enjoy some naked stuff of a totally legal nature.</p>

<p><strong><em>As of writing this, there is still porn on Tumblr.</em></strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs not to say that <em>porn</em> was the only reason Tumblr was ever good, or popular, though. But once they started targeting their own users, <em>they never stopped</em>. On the corporate internet, LGBTQ+ people are targeted regularly. On Twitter, on Threads, on Fartbook, on Tumblr, and so on. It can be hard to find a place to really call a digital <em>home</em>. Which is why a lot of people have fled to the ActivityPub federated Tumblr clone, <a href="https://app.wafrn.net" target="_blank">Wafrn</a>. And, while it still may be in its infancy, or working through development, it is a <em>far better bet</em> for those of the LGBTQ+ persuasion who are tired of being harassed, targeted, and banned <em>literally everywhere</em> a corporation touches.</p>

<p>People deserve to be able to express themselves freely, online, without being made out to be pariahs for their mere <em>existence</em>. Obviously, when I say ‚Äúexpress themselves freely‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean that, people should be able to say slurs and abhorrent things without question or consequences. It you feel the need for a social network where you are allowed to do those things, you don‚Äôt need social media, <em>you need therapy.</em></p>

<p>Is a move to Wordpress.com going to change anything for Tumblr? I don‚Äôt know, maybe? If they finally turn on fediverse integration, it could help. But, knowing the CEO is a thin-skinned whiner, I just don‚Äôt feel confident about that.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
