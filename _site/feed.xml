One of the reasons I briefly switched back to Windows, is <em>because</em> I wanted to do so, and couldn’t on Pop!_OS, despite having purchased pretty much every version of CoD since the <em>original</em> Black Ops 2. But, I ultimately decided that being able to play CoD wasn’t worth the trade-off of … using Windows. That was, until I realized I could play Modern Warfare III, and, presumably, Black Ops 6, on GeForce now. There is … an issue, though.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and you just kind of install Debian, and all your essential apps and then forget about it, and then you load up GeForce Now thinking, “Hey, let’s play some FourthNite,” you’ll run into an issue. A weird issue. An annoying issue.</p>

<p>Your mouse won’t move in a 360 degree rotation.</p>

<p>And let me tell you, there are <em>no</em> resources online that are easily able to be Googled in order to solve this. In fact, I had to track down the GeForce Now flatpak author on Github, and then do some investigating in the issues specifically in relation to <em>that</em> version of the app. Needless to say, I found the answer. And it hadn’t ocurred to me, because, I guess Pop!_OS just does this by default, and that is therefore why I didn’t experience this problem.</p>

<p>You have to use Xorg/X11.</p>

<p>Go to the login screen on Debian, click the gear at the bottom left, and choose Xorg. Do not use Wayland.</p>

<p>I’m not all up in the discourse on Wayland, but this isn’t the <em>only</em> issue it has, and I <em>totally</em> forgot that it has problems.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I can now play Call of Duty on Linux, with minimal input lag via a streaming service. Which is <em>pretty impressive</em>. Albeit, I’m not much of an Nvidia fan (I use Radeon, after-all) due to them basically abandoning gaming and going all-in on melting the Earth’s icecaps by shipping trillions of cards <em>specifically</em> for use in machines that steal art from people, but <strong>whatever</strong>.</p>

<p>Until kernel level anticheat is made illegal, this is what you have to deal with unless you want to use a spyware OS (Windows).</p>

<p>Either way, I wanted to write this down, and put it here, simply because there are <em>very few</em> resources in regards to this topic. But now there’s one, at least.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Linux" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As some may know, I play Call of Duty sometimes.

Mostly because, I want to keep writing something almost every single day. You know, personal goals and such. And then I remembered old-school forum banter, and forums in-general. I’m currently a member of a few, but I rarely ever post. I guess new age social media has kind of taken my attention away from such things, unfortunately, but do you remember things like, sharing your wallpapers on a weekly basis? People just snapping photos of their desktops and being like, “Check it out dude.” Peppridge Farm remembers.</p>

<p>Not that anyone can really <em>share</em> anything on my personal site, but I wanted to get back into the tradition of things I used to do online, that I thought was really interesting and cool. Sharing my frikken’ wallpaper.</p>

<p>I think about old forums, how I’d log on in the middle of class at tech while my teacher was trying to … teach me visual basic, and I’d just refresh, refresh, refresh. Kind of like how I refresh my timeline on social media sites nowadays, except I’m not sure what I was looking for back then. People responding to my posts, interesting things to reply to, friendships to make? Do we still make <em>friends</em> online, or are our followers an extension of acquaintanceship?</p>

<p>I’ve thought about using part of the server I have rented over at Digital Ocean to slap down some roots for a modern forum, but would anyone even join? I know the Discourse software is pretty neat, and good, and I’d <em>love</em> to set it up, customize it, make it look neat, maybe even start up some kind of themed email list.</p>

<p>But, I feel like a lot of people have either forgotten forums, or the idea of it is so far away and in the past, that some may <em>not even know</em> what the heck I’m talking about.</p>

<p>“What do you <em>mean</em> post static messages on a board that isn’t constantly flooding me with information overload, and engagement bait?”</p>

<p>Then again, I guess Reddit is sort of a never-ending forum? Message board? Except it’s got random people on it that like to fight with you so that they can feel superior, for, … you know, reasons?</p>

<p>I don’t know. I think back to the early 90s and how my Dad used to dial-in to bulletin boards to talk to people, and I get the feeling this is one of those lost “arts” of the internet that would be really hard to bring back, en masse. So many people posting on things like Tik Tok, which, I can never get used to. What do you mean you gotta share videos of yourself and be perceived at all times in order to participate? Have any of you ever heard of being introverted? Or just, writing text?</p>

<p>Maybe it would be neat to make a new forum, even if it’s <em>just for me</em>.</p>

<p>And maybe I’d post my wallpaper on a weekly basis, call it a public static journal.</p>

<p>Like … like a blog?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sitting here listening to Spotify most of the evening, browsing the social fediverse, and kind of thinking about things to write on this blog.

Everything’s a swiper, everyone’s making decisions based on appearances, and nothing else. Most of the accounts on these apps are like, 2% real people, and 98% bots, Instagram account spammers, scammers waiting for you in a motel with a baseball bat and some dude, and couples looking for a unicorn. It’s dire out there, brosefinas.</p>

<p>But there’s this one dating app that kind of emerged way back, and now they’re spending money for ad revenue, billing themselves as the app that’s <em>not like the other apps</em>, with ads that feature cartoon dudes talking about how all the other apps (Tinder, Bumble) are all about beauty pageants. How they’re not fun anymore, they’re all scams. How they keep swiping daily, more as a last-ditch hope that <em>someday</em>, they get lucky.</p>

<p>It’s aiming itself directly at lonely guys, and, okay, sure. There are <em>a lot of lonely guys</em>. And, I mean, <em>some</em> of them are lonely for good reason.</p>

<p>I decided to give a shot, though. Because, hey, they’re not like the other apps, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/boo/boo.avif" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>It’s true: Most dating apps in 2024 are a scam. They don’t exist to match you with anyone. They don’t exist to <em>be deleted</em>. They exist to <em>extract as much money as possible</em> out of you, in the exploitation of your loneliness, and hopes of ever finding love. And with the way offline life has gone since the pandemic, meeting online is <em>also</em> becoming one of the only ways to … genuinely connect with someone.</p>

<p>According to this <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/08/online-dating-popular-way-u-s-couples-meet#:~:text=Matchmaking%20is%20now%20the%20primary,and%20contributed%20to%20the%20research." target="_blank">National Academy of Sciences study</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Rosenfeld found that heterosexual couples are more likely to meet a romantic partner online than through personal contacts and connections. Since 1940, traditional ways of meeting partners – through family, in church and in the neighborhood – have all been in decline, Rosenfeld said.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rosenfeld, a lead author on the research and a professor of sociology in the School of Humanities and Sciences, drew on a nationally representative 2017 survey of American adults and found that about 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting their partner online, compared to 22 percent in 2009. Sonia Hausen, a graduate student in sociology, was a co-author of the paper and contributed to the research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes on to talk about how, with online dating, people have a <em>much larger</em> pool of potential partners to choose from, and this is basically why online dating has become the full and total norm (at least, if you’re fully straight, which I am <em>not</em>).</p>

<p>So … then why is there a loneliness epidemic? Why is this app titled “Boo” advertising itself by calling other apps scams.</p>

<p>It’s because, like I said, <em>they are.</em></p>

<p>But Boo’s not much any better.</p>

<p>Sure, you can <em>actually</em> match with people, and potentially start conversations. You can select from a large amount of profile information to make matching easier. You can make posts as if you’re on some kind of social media website, and swipe left and right, just like on all the other apps.</p>

<p>Until they hit you with the, “36 dollars a month, please” ask.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/boo/37.png" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Come to think of it … you can talk to people on Tinder. You can talk to people on Bumble.</p>

<p>It’s that, <em>usually</em>, when the time comes to talk, most people <em>don’t</em>. But that’s besides the point of the issue here.</p>

<p>The issue, is that these apps think they’re worth as much as Apple Premium, for almost <em>no features</em>.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but being able to continuously match with potential partners, and message to my heart’s content is <em>not worth</em> nearly the cost of two Doordash orders per month. It’s not worth the cost of a Crumbl cookie. It’s not worth the cost of running a 500 user Mastodon instance.</p>

<p>People <em>must</em> actually be paying these fees for things you used to be able to do for free in 2012 on dating websites, and that’s just <em>sad</em>, dude. <strong>Stop</strong> paying these companies nearly 40 to 50 dollars a month, and go sign up for like, I don’t know, an anime box? A handful of streaming services? A monthly motel room to sit alone by yourself and watch TV on a foreign bed?</p>

<p>Do <em>anything</em>, besides rewarding these soul-sucking companies for being machines of exploitation. And I’m talking about <em>you</em>, too, Boo.</p>

<p>“We’re not like the other apps.”</p>

<p>Yeah, you’re not.</p>

<p>Most of the other apps aren’t trying to convince people they totally aren’t run by scum of the Earth, grifters.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the year I wrote about the terrible situation that is dating in the post-2020 world.

And by that, I mean, my offline job. At times, especially the past week, I’ve had a real hard time justifying even getting out of bed in the morning. But, I got out of work last night around 9pm, and I was exploring feed readers, because reading feeds is coming back (via enshitification of everything else). But I didn’t like how most readers are trying to sell monthly subscriptions for features like, being able to make a folder, and storing feeds in them. And then I thought, “I’ll make one.”</p>

<p>Enter: GridStream.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>An app that utilizes Python, SQL, and Flask (depending on how you use it), to generate a web interface that, if you look at the code, is not at all unlike Jekyll. But then, once built, you can open it up on desktop via an executable. Upon opening it for the first time, the database is created, and then everything you add to your feed is stored <em>in there</em>.</p>

<p>I spent all of last night and most of today working on it, and I managed to compensate for most of what I believe people will try to add to their feeds. Although, Reddit still doesn’t really fully display properly.</p>

<p>That’s not a huge problem, though, I think, because blogs, which is where most feeds come from, display <em>just fine</em>, and also <em>awesomely</em>.</p>

<p>I wanted to turn it into a flatpak and then send it over to flathub, but holy freakin’ crap, uh, maybe another time? Anyway, regardless of what happens with it in the future, it’s open sourced and <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/gridstream" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>, with a release that includes an executable.</p>

<p>GridStream is named after a streaming radio station that emerged during the early years of one of the first sci-fi MMOs <em>ever</em> created, Anarchy Online. The radio station is still running today, and you can <a href="http://www.gridstream.org/gsp/cms/front" target="_blank">listen to it here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, work has been a pain in the ass lately.

In my sickness addled brain, I have slapped together something that will tickle your pickle, or fancy. With a few lines (100 or so) of Python, we can force the Tumblr API to give us whatever it thinks is the top trending image post of the day, and slap that thing onto ActivityPub. Matt might be trying to bury Wordpress in a shallow grave, but maybe we can pretend that Tumblr has ActivityPub integration with some hacks.</p>

<p>The full script is <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/tumblr-py" target="_blank">over here on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know for sure yet if this will capture <em>more than one post</em>. I currently have it setup on a cronjob that makes a post daily, and in my experimenting, it only seemed to grab <em>the one post</em>. This is why I’ve set it up to run once a day, to see if that post ever changes. You can see what the script output in my testing, below, on my Mastodon account.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> a way to grab <em>every single</em> trending post on Tumblr, and then sort out the image posts, and then post <em>one of those posts</em> at random, but! You are limited to the amount of times you can make an API call to Tumblr, per day, and this would <em>very likely</em> push you right over that limit, because, in order to do this, you have to make <em>many, many API calls.</em></p>

<p>I should also add a warning, I haven’t built-in any way to classify image posts, meaning, this could pull lewd or offensive content without warning, which is why I have it setup to always post with image sensitivity and a spoiler warning. I <em>may</em> look into figuring out implementing that later, along with possibly figuring out a way to have all my scripts give some kind of alt text to images (but I imagine that won’t be possible unless I implement AI, which I don’t think I want to do).</p>

<p>Either way, enjoy!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever thought to yourself, “Self, I wish there was more Tumblr on Mastodon?” Well, do I have some freakin’ news for you.

I get fed lines like, “I come to work no matter what unless I’m <em>literally</em> dying.” And, I mean, I guess, hats-off to those of you who wish to die on the job, or collapse in a lesser sense. But that isn’t me.</p>

<p>I’m freakin’ <em>sick</em>. Haven’t been this sick since I had covid in 2022.</p>

<p>But, I wanted to make this post today, to share some things I do, because I can <em>at least</em> still type on my laptop, and would like to present some ways you can buy things, or services from me (so that I can recoup what’s lost from having to call out from work).</p>

<p>Firstly, I run a tiny little online business, wherein I make link-pages for people. How this works, is that you pay me, give me the details of all the links you want on the page, plus any images, gifs, or other elements, and then I put it together. Once it’s assembled, I put it up on Neocities with a username of your choosing and a placeholder password (that you’ll have to change), and hand you the keys. Easy-peasy, and a great way to break free from monthly payments and contracts from the big corporations trying to sell this to you on a continuous basis.</p>

<p>You can see more about this, <a href="https://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also make music, and, funnily enough, it’s <em>because of my offline job</em> that my next album is taking me <em>so long</em> to complete. I’m really only a few tracks in, with ideas for more coming up. Regardless, I do have it on preorder, and will have to just keep adjusting that release date until it’s actually ready. Never-the-less, you can check out disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX, <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, if you just like what I do, be it what I do with my website, or applications I develop, or what I do with music, or even Second Life, you can sign up on my Ko-fi, maybe even on a monthly basis! Find that link, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I would also list my Second Life store marketplace here, but the pay from purchases on products within that store, and inside of Second Life, is so criminally low, it would only make a difference if someone bought <em>everything</em> in the store, all-at-once.</p>

<p>Either way, thanks for stopping by and giving all of this a read–I’m going to go lay down until a request comes in~</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, much to the dismay of boss/es at the offline job, I’m taking off work today, because going to work feeling every ache and pain in my bones and muscles as this bronchitis, or the flu, ravages my immune system without rest, is just too freakin much.

No, I’m not talking about Daikatana. That game is pretty cool, and I’m pretty sure it’s also very well known. I’m talking about Julie and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, a game that came, then said, “Hey!” and subsequently vanished into the ether of game development … seemingly, <em>forever</em>.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/heavy-metal/fakk2.png" /></p>

<p>A game built on the Quake 3 engine, based on / a sequel to Heavy Metal 2000 (a movie, release July 10, 2000), and developed by the now defunct and erased Ritual Entertainment (see: SiN, SiN: Emergence).</p>

<p>If you asked me, “Nova, why do you think this game failed?” I don’t think I’d be able to answer! It’s a fantasy style boobs, guns, and swords sorta game (you know how the late 90s and 2000s were in regard to gaming) that was trying to be Ritual’s version of Tomb Raider. I emphasize the boobs part, because, as you got damaged in the game, <em>so did Julie’s outfit.</em></p>

<p>The synopsis was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F.A.K.K. 2 stands for “Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone to the second level”, and is the alias both of the heroine, Julie, and also her homeworld. Before the game begins, we are told that Julie has previously killed a tyrant and “would-be God” named Lord Tyler (during the events of Heavy Metal 2000), and brought the remnant of her people to a planet called Eden. The people of Eden have made a startling discovery: the waters of the planet grant an eternal life to those who drink it, and they have restored ti-rural paradise, pasturing ‘creepers’ (large bull-like creatures) and peacefully going about their business.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This planet is camouflaged by a F.A.K.K. 2 beacon and made to look like a biohazard-strewn wasteland in the hope that it will remain hidden from any threat. However, a creature named Gith, who appears only as a disembodied cybernetic head, runs a hyper-corporation called GITH Industries whose “employees” are little more than slaves. He scavenges the universe in a ship composed of three-quarters of a planet, and is headed for a place called Na’ChThraThull, or the “place of the soft machines”, which turns out to be Eden.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julie resides in the town of Eden with her sister Kerrie, who is pregnant. She interacts with various citizens, including her brother-in-law, Germain St. Germain. Peace is suddenly disturbed by the appearance of hostile insect-like creatures called Vymishes. Julie springs into combat, killing many of the creatures and saving a pregnant creeper in the process. She also kills a Vymish Mama, a queen-like Vymish. Afterward, Julie heads into town and meets Otto, the town’s gunsmith, who she gives a glowing green asteroid to for examination. Another asteroid knocks out the shield, and Julie, accompanied by Jared and Eon, is tasked with resetting the shield generator. Underground, Julie’s accomplices are killed by creatures called Grawlix, and she is forced to continue alone. She eventually resets the shield generator, but is too late to discover that GITH has arrived, and he teleports troops in to destroy the generator.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julie returns to town to find it under siege by GITH’s forces. Many citizens are dead, while others are hypnotized. Julie finds Otto, who has recovered a mysterious object from the asteroid. It turns out to be a message for Julie from the “Belphigoreans”, warning her that Gith is seeking the “Heart of the We”. Otto tells Julie about the Heart of the We, and tasks her with finding a native of Eden named Gruff. Julie leaves the besieged Eden, then journeys through the Mooagly swamps to find Gruff, who unlocks the path to the Temple of the We for her. She then overcomes the four challenges of the We before entering the final temple where the Heart of the We is kept. However, GITH is waiting for her, and he steals the Heart and uses it to bring Lord Tyler back to life, so he could have his revenge on Julie. However, Julie fights and kills Lord Tyler and wins the Heart, banishing GITH. She returns to town only to find out that her pregnant sister is kidnapped by GITH, who returns in a giant space station.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/heavy-metal/julie.png" /></p>

<p>I <em>may</em> have beaten this game, I actually don’t even remember. What I <em>do</em> remember, is my parent’s Pentium Gateway <em>wasn’t</em> powerful enough to play it at 60 FPS. In fact, I think I had <em>a lot</em> of issues <em>just</em> playing it. Which boggled my mind, because the PC ran Quake 3 very easily, and pretty well.</p>

<p>Hey, maybe that’s why the game isn’t really remembered all too well. But, it could also be because Ritual Entertainment sold themselves to a mobile game studio and then vanished, never to be heard from again.</p>

<p>But when it <em>did</em> work, it was a cool game. Running, gunning, slicing, platforming, and wild cinematics. Back in the day, I was a pretty big fan of the Heavy Metal magazine, and all the art that came with it. I think I remember watching Heavy Metal 2000, and trying to figure out how it fit into the timeline of the game … only to realize I glossed over the part where they say the game’s like, 30 years after 2000. It <em>kind</em> of makes me want to try and get it running on a modern Windows system, just to play through it one more time, so that I can clearly remember everything. And I say “Windows system,” because <em>I already tried</em> using Wine and Proton to make this game work on Linux, and it <em>refused</em>.</p>

<p>But this is just a long line of games from Ritual that are lost to history, and nearly lost-media. Just like SiN, and Emergence. I think the two latter games are more known and memorable, and some may even still be waiting for their continuation, but if you’re interested in preserving history, and gaming history, like me, you’d probably like to know this game existed at some point, and it <em>should</em> be resurrected. If only to have a spot on the internet archive.</p>

<p>Oh! It <em>does</em> have <a href="https://archive.org/details/fakk2-pc-redump" target="_blank">a spot</a> there!</p>

<p><em>As of writing this, the internet archive is currently down due to a low-life who hacked and took the system down, but should be recovered at some point in the near future, so that my link to the FAKK 2 archive works.</em></p>

<p>I write about this, though, partially, because I still miss the era of mid-90s and 2000s era gaming <em>very much</em>. Not for the porn-y aspects of gaming that were all over the place back then, but just because games were released <em>faster</em>, and there were so many different concepts, things people and studios were willing to try … until the never-ending profit machine of our modern society decided to generic-ise everything.</p>

<p>Anyway, what the FAKK?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’m on this kick of looking back over the years at old games that are still mega-popular, I also want to look at games that maybe nobody remembers, or even knows about.

</p>

<p>Once you download it from <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/ExTube" target="_blank">this github repo</a>, just unzip it, and run it! You have to select a directory target for where you’re saving the videos, and also a URL, but after that, everything <em>should</em> be a-okay. I’ve tested it numerous times now and it runs fine.</p>

<p>Now, the download <em>will only</em> download up to a maximum of 720p resolution videos. I did this, because 1080p can get a little chunk in your HDD, and I didn’t feel like making the app more complicated (such as by having to create a resolution selector). This is just, a real simple, give me the URL, and now you can watch a Youtube video without any ads whatsoever.</p>

<p>And! If you wanna support the YouTuber who uploaded it, you can still go right to their channel and hit that subscribble button.</p>

According to the Neocities subreddit, the person <em>behind</em> Neocities had written, a year ago, some <a href="https://kyledrake.com/writings/ai" target="_blank">positive thinking</a> about AI (which, I’m not sure can be fully judged a year later, since it’s only gotten extremely bad, <em>this year</em>). In response, some users were suggesting Nekoweb as an alternative for people who don’t want to be potentially affiliated with someone who endorses Sam Altman. And then I stumbled into an issue, and the <em>strangest</em> people I’ve met this week (so far).</p>

<p>Nekoweb is much like Neocities, and even more-so, it offers services that Neocities <em>doesn’t</em>. At first glance, this seems pretty awesome. You have more storage space, more bandwith, access to Git, FTP, and it’s even got framework for deploying your site with a static generator (like Jekyll). “Sweet.” I thought, this could really make my life easier, instead of pushing through Github, to Neocities, right?</p>

<p>There’s just <em>one problem.</em></p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/nekoweb/no-vpn.png" /></p>

<p>Nekoweb requires you reveal all personal information to them, in order to register an account. VPNs are <em>not allowed</em>.</p>

<p>The only other place online, thus far, that I’ve had any issue with using my VPN, be it via Proton’s subscription service that I use for e-mail, or Apple’s built-in VPN, has been Misskey’s flagship server (that auto-blocks Western users from registering). Not even <em>Activision</em> blocks you from using a VPN while playing their highly competitive shooters, Call of Duty.</p>

<p>So, like ya do, I joined their Discord, curious, a little bummed. Thinking, there’s <em>no way</em> I have to turn off something completely related to my <em>own</em> online safety and privacy just to make an account here, right?</p>

<p><em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p>I don’t feel the need to post direct screenshots, since this website is seen by quite a few more people than my Mastodon account, so I’ll just quote the person who immediately replied to me when I asked, “So why can’t I have my VPN turned on when I’m making an account?”</p>

<p>User / Supporter / or maybe even dev? responds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why are you using VPN to register an account?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>we had spammers use VPN to comment hate stuff on users guestbooks</p>

<p>The Nekoweb team member responds,</p>

  <p>abuse prevention</p>

<p>Flabbergasted, blown-away, I respond, “I use a VPN provided by Proton’s subscription service that comes along with their e-mail, entirely just for privacy lol”</p>

<p>To which the first user replies, again,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>well in order to register you need proper internet connection and no VPN.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p><strong>PROPER INTERNET CONNECTION???</strong></p>

<p>It was at this point I kind of fell off and spiraled a bit, implied neither of them know what they’re doing, and left.</p>

<p>So, no, I absolutely wouldn’t recommend you use Nekoweb as an alternative to Neocities, if that’s what you’re looking for. How people who <em>don’t even know</em> what a VPN does, or is used for by average people, ended up <em>making an entire</em> web service, is wild, ridiculous, and makes absolutely no sense. And I get the impression that they <em>don’t want</em> new users, or any subscription money for that matter. Which is fine. They aren’t getting any from me.</p>

<p>For anyone else, who might be a little more rationally inclined, why use a VPN?</p>

<p>It’s not just for watching shows on Netflix you can’t get in the US. Some countries are blocked from most internet access and can’t interact with the outside world, <em>without</em> a VPN. Guess they aren’t allowed to make websites, either?</p>

<p>Why do <em>I</em> use a VPN? I use one, because I don’t think every website and provider needs my personal information at all times, every single time I access a domain. I especially don’t think the developers behind Nekoweb need my personal information, <em>just to make an account</em> on their Neocities clone. Entitled to my data as they may be, if you have a problem with spam and abuse coming from users behind VPNs, and you just ban VPN use, uhm, guys? You <em>know</em> that perpetrators of abuse can just make a new e-mail and do exactly the same thing, without a VPN? They could drive down the street to McDonalds, log on, and continue harassing your users.</p>

<p>And, I’m sorry, I’m still reeling over “proper internet connection.”</p>

<p>I’m just out of words in my brain sauce that would allow me to express how <em>ridiculous</em> that sounds … you guys made this web service? For real? You made a whole web service for hosting websites and you don’t even know the <em>first thing</em> about privacy and safety online?</p>

<p>Holy hell.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I woke up, and, like I do, I checked my “daily report” bot e-mail, and noticed something … strange. According to the Neocities subreddit, the person behind Neocities had written, a year ago, some positive thinking about AI (which, I’m not sure can be fully judged a year later, since it’s only gotten extremely bad, this year). In response, some users were suggesting Nekoweb as an alternative for people who don’t want to be potentially affiliated with someone who endorses Sam Altman. And then I stumbled into an issue, and the strangest people I’ve met this week (so far).]]></summary></entry></feed>
