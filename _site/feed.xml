In my ActivityPub distro-hopping adventures, I’ve installed Mastodon onto a VPS, and switched back. Not because Sharkey is <em>bad</em>, or not to my liking. It’s great! But I can’t keep myself away from the Mastodon software. Even if Sharkey has some advantages over it.</p>

<p>Mastodon, for sure, isn’t perfect. But I find myself having to think about <em>a lot less</em> when I’m running my own instance. In fact, I’ve done it so many times, I think it took me 20 minutes to setup the instance, and get everything configured correctly? Not that it was <em>hard</em> to setup Sharkey, but I’m getting good at this. My one issue with Sharkey, is that scaling means basically crippling your instance to have to reset all files for local and remote users to keep cache and bandwidth down, and without an automated way to do this, well.</p>

<p>As you know, I am a tired person.</p>

<p>I have Mastodon running with a cron task that just kills media attachment cache once every 7 days, I have the database tuned to the correct stats for the server I’m running on Debian, and I’m storing all remaining media attachments on an S3 bucket.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>I’m finished.</p>

<p>I’m so tired my eye is twitching.</p>

<p>But I think this is where I’ll stay for now.</p>

<p>I think.</p>

<p>Not only that, I’m using Google’s API to send me an e-mail <em>any time</em> there’s a new comment.</p>

<p>It’s all in the repository so that you can see how it’s done, and use it yourself … if you have a Jekyll blog.</p>

You buy 400 games on Steam, but ultimately you end up back in a Blizzard game. Or, … in this day and age, an ActiBlizzard game. Or, in this specific day and age, <em>Diablo 4</em>, so that you can prove you’re better than Elon Musk.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/diablo/load.png" /></p>

<p>No, I won’t elaborate on that.</p>

<p>But I’ve been playing a lot of Diablo 4. I’m beyond level 50 now! Which is more than I can say for myself when the game <em>actually released</em>.</p>

<p>Playing <em>this game</em>, though, kind of makes Diablo 3 look like something I’m unsure how I ever enjoyed. I did, of course, but 4 is so much prettier, and <em>darker</em>, and also I’m a Necromancer and everything I touch dies in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Yes, bosses, too.</p>

<p>Diablo is something that goes back. Way back. It was one of the games I started playing after Doom and Quake finally started to get kinda <em>old</em> feeling, to me. You know, back in like 1997. You see, my uncle and cousin used to play Diablo 1, and eventually, Diablo 2 together all the time. And I wanted to join them.</p>

<p><em>I just wasn’t all that good at it</em>, and I didn’t have any money to buy these games.</p>

<p>I did, however, get hold of Diablo 1. And I think back to one of my first, and last experiences with the game. A player, lending me his sword. It was powerful. I had <em>nothing</em>. I was just … a noob. I don’t even think I was halfway to whatever max level was back then.</p>

<p>I certainly wasn’t anywhere <em>near</em> hell.</p>

<p>But I needed a weapon. One that was good. And this guy was willing to lend me his sword until I found something better.</p>

<p>“Here, you can use my sword for a while.” I paraphrased. “I’ll be on tomorrow!”</p>

<p>And then I logged off.</p>

<p>And then I never logged on again, <em>ever</em> (if you’re out there, I’ll give you a new sword in Diablo 4).</p>

<p>I got more serious when it came to Diablo 2, but I was still largely, <em>no good, and also crap</em>.</p>

<p>And then flash forward to Diablo 4, I’m alright, I guess.</p>

<iframe title="Diablo 4 is Easy" width="560" height="315" src="https://video.infosec.exchange/videos/embed/98c11475-fa49-4876-9908-2f1fea5bbe5f" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe>

<p>Through D3 and D4, though, I <em>do</em> find it continually strange, as my Necromancer draws no fear from other people, and in Diablo 4, my Necro speaks about the “light,” and heaven.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I’m here like, … wouldn’t the Necromancer be on Lillith’s side?</p>

<p>Then again, I haven’t even finished act 1 (I spend a lot of time wandering and doing mostly nothing but side quests and killing bosses).</p>

<p>I think if Blizzard ever made a new MMO, they should just do it with this. I mean, that’s basically what it is at this point.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s the post. I just wanted to say, “Hey, Diablo 4 is pretty cool.”</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="diablo4" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="blizzard" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a tale as old as time.

Now that I’ve done that, it’s time to get back to work in figuring out how I can integrate my Sharkey instance into my website (such as like inserting my post feed into a side-bar, having trending topics on my side-bar, and so on).</p>

<p>What I would like to mention, since they’ve been pretty awesome since I started with them, and up until yesterday when I decided to turn off the instance: <a href="https://toot.io/mastodon_hosting.html" target="_blank">Toot.io</a></p>

<p>These guys have provided an <em>extremely</em> solid Mastodon experience for me for most of the year. Little to <em>no</em> issues, elastic search built-in, on-time updates, and <em>even when I was having some financial issues</em>, they worked with me in order to keep my instance from making me go broke in the short term.</p>

<p>I’m now currently running my own copy of Sharkey over at Elest.io, and they’ve been alright so far, but the experience is mostly <em>in my own hands</em>, since I now maintain the instance, plus the structure behind it.</p>

<p>But! If you’re interested in hosting a very simple Mastodon instance, and want <em>little</em> to fuss with, or even <em>setup</em>, I highly recommend Toot.io hosting. I even felt kind of bad turning off my Mastodon instance, <em>just because</em> they’ve been so good this whole time. But I yearned for more, and Sharkey has the more I’m looking for.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean <em>you</em> should launch your own instance of alternative ActivityPub software, though! If you’re <em>new</em> to this, and maybe don’t know how to use a command line, or a terminal, <em>absolutely</em> get yourself some managed hosting.</p>

And I thought to myself, “I wonder what it would be like to launch a Sharkey instance?” And so I did! And, while I <em>have</em> had prior experience with Sharkey … I like to run things myself. I like to tinker with them. And now I have a full Sharkey instance, <em>that I can surely edit to my liking on the command line</em>.</p>

<p>But, and I mean, Mastodon is great, but! Sharkey has <em>a lot</em> more customization options, <em>a lot</em> more <em>everything</em>. And because I’m pretty much an advanced fediverse user, I figured, “Hell yeah, let’s do it.” So, I’m migrating everything to my new Sharkey instance at <a href="https://sharkey.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">sharkey.mkultra.monster</a>, and once I feel like it won’t break anything, I’ll likely be turning off the Mastodon instance. The sharkey instance is <em>also</em> cheaper, and I need to save my money.</p>

<p>I’ve also got just about <em>every single</em> script I’ve made, hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS, working correctly and posting to the new instance, <em>including</em> the auto-posting this blog does once I hit commit!</p>

<p>The only downside, is posts aren’t going to have comments until I figure out a different way to do them, and some of the elements on my sidebars here are commented out until I design a <em>different</em> way to display my presence on the fediverse.</p>

<p>All-in-all, this is <em>really</em> cool, and I’m sure I’ll spend countless hours redoing scripts to interface with Sharkey (lol oh god).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Sharkey" /><category term="sharkey" /><category term="activitypub" /><category term="socialmedia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I was messing around with a Linux VPS, like you do.

While the muse for which I use to create has been a very slow monster, I’ve started to notice that ever since I basically rebuilt my life, I haven’t really shared any of it that much. This is true for a lot of things I do, <em>except for these scripts</em> I’ve been making lately. So, let’s fix that.</p>

<p>I already have an automated account on my Mastodon instance that I use for sharing random things cycled via Python scripts on my VPS, but what if we used it to share random songs from all of my releases?</p>

<p>And that, we have done.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I <em>can’t</em> use Bandcamp. Because Bandcamp won’t let you scrape artist pages with a script, and if you’re going to use a browser in headless mode to achieve the same thing (and make it work), you need the server where you’re running that script to <em>actually allow you to do that</em>.</p>

<p>… which I cannot do at Digital Ocean (the chromium driver needed to do this is either inaccessible, or non-existent).</p>

<p>So!</p>

<p>Even though I absolutely <em>do not use</em> Spotify, due to their negligence of artists, and <em>paying them</em>, it is <em>at least</em> a public app that can be accessed and even listened to by pretty much anyone. As much as I prefer Apple Music, that random people can’t really just open a link and listen, is kind of an issue. And, I also am not sure if Apple Music has a readily available API.</p>

<p>Which Spotify does.</p>

<p>So, the app that hates the artists that make it the revenue it needs to continue operating, is unfortunately the avenue we’re going to take, until there’s something better.</p>

<p>And, voila.</p>

But, that aside, from within my feed, I’m watching and seeing reports of <em>constant</em> troll attacks, some stating, “Yeah, I don’t like it here actually.” So, let’s talk about Mastodon, again, maybe?</p>

<p>Over the past week or so, I’ve seen posts from people talking about, and have experienced <em>personally</em>, Kiwifarms trolls following people in some inane scare tactic. If you don’t know what KF is, it’s an extremely niche stalker website full of pyschopaths whose only hobbies are documenting and stalking people online, with mostly fabricated information.</p>

<p>It’s been giving people a bit of a sour taste in their mouths in regards to sticking to this, <em>basically</em>, brand new platform.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, it seems <em>now</em>, as of today, that trolls are going around sending users <em>extremely graphic</em> and violent images of death.</p>

<p>I want to note, that Mastodon <em>is not perfect</em> by any stretch. But this is where true decentralization comes in, and saves the day.</p>

<p>If you’re on a community run instance on Mastodon (or other <a class="pages-link" href="/pages/activitypub">AcitivityPub</a> software), or <em>your own</em>, you don’t have to put up with this kind of behavior. You don’t have to play whack-a-mole with every new account that pops up. You can just … <em>block out the instance that is acting as the source of this behavior</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, Mastodon <em>does</em> have its own issues. There are <em>a lot</em> of basic FOSS guys, and do they <em>love</em> to either give you bad advice, unprompted advice, or scold you for doing things <em>your way</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bskyagain/some-dude.png" /></p>

<p>I’m showing you this, in order to be fully transparent about what you <em>may</em> encounter on Mastodon, and how we would deal with this. For context, I have Python scripts running on a VPS, and one of them sends random images from top posts across different subreddits, to Mastodon. Some of them are NSFW, some of them <em>aren’t</em>. Either way, I <em>also</em> have it tagging each post with hashtags I wanted to have on it, like #python (because it’s running on python!)</p>

<p>This isn’t favorable to some. Simply using your mute button isn’t enough. Some people have to <em>tell you</em> that they don’t like that you’re using your software, your instance, and your social media to do whatever you want, your own way.</p>

<p>And that’s fine!</p>

<p>We can send him into the ether, never to be heard from again. <em>Or,</em> we can block the entirety of the instance he’s coming from.</p>

<p>In this example, I’m not sure what kind of behavior <em>usually</em> comes out of chaos.social, but we can check it to see if this is the attitude of more of its users, or if this guy is an outlier.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bskyagain/chaos.png" /></p>

<p>So, chaos.social looks pretty run-of-the-mill and likely not a massive source of basic FOSS guys trying to dictate to random people on the fediverse how they should post. We won’t have to block the whole entire instance. But! Since blocking single users is probably something everyone’s already familiar with, and doesn’t take a lot to figure out how to do, let me just show you how one <em>would</em> block the whole instance, if in fact it <em>was</em> a bed of trolls and hats of the arse.</p>

<p>If you click that little pea-pod under a user’s post, and look down, you can see the option to, as a singular user, block the entire domain.</p>

<p>What this will do, is <em>evaporate</em> all posts coming from that server, entirely. <em>You will never see them again</em>, unless you unblock them.</p>

<p>In the instance that a server happens to be a bed of trolls, maybe trolls who are sending people threats, being assholes, or generally gross, this is an <em>awesome</em> feature.</p>

<p>Now, I get it. The <em>perfect</em> social media experience would be <em>never having</em> to interact with, or deal with trolls, or people with a superiority complex. Unfortunately, that’s not the world we currently live in. When choosing a Mastodon server, or a server of any kind that’s connected to ActivityPub, it is <em>very important</em> to make sure that server has <em>rules</em>, and guidelines for behavior.</p>

<p>I understand that this is, for some, an <em>incredible</em> extra step to just signing up, and posting. But it’s <em>essential</em>. It … will really help avoid situations down the line where you’re suddenly asking the entire fediverse, “Hey, why are there so many trolls???” and then everyone’s pointing to your instance, that <em>has no rules</em>.</p>

<p>If you decide Bluesky isn’t the right place for you, <em>don’t go back to Twitter.</em> Give the “Linux of social media” a chance, and <em>maybe</em> you won’t be disappointed. Mileage may vary, but there really is something to using software that is highly customizable, near completely user owned, and run.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="mastodon" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like I do, I’ve been semi-tracking and participating in the boom of the Bluesky social network, even though it’s not decentralized, currently, in any meaningful way. In my own experience, I’m having a hard time finding “my people.” I don’t even know if I have a “my people” anymore. But, that aside, from within my feed, I’m watching and seeing reports of constant troll attacks, some stating, “Yeah, I don’t like it here actually.” So, let’s talk about Mastodon, again, maybe?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Load Up the Gram, and Download It!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/programming/2024/11/25/load-up-the-gram-and-download-it.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Load Up the Gram, and Download It!" /><published>2024-11-25T01:17:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-11-25T01:17:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/programming/2024/11/25/load-up-the-gram-and-download-it</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/programming/2024/11/25/load-up-the-gram-and-download-it.html"><![CDATA[<p>Like an absolute madman, I slapped together a little Linux Python app for targeting an Instagram profile, and then downloading its entire contents. After <em>much</em> fussing with the unintuitive Github, and figuring out Twine, I <em>uploaded it directly into the fully public system where anyone can download and use it.</em> That’s right.</p>

<p>Based on the “instaloader” code, I’ve put a GUI around it, and made it really simple to use. Just input the username of the profile you want to download (such as your own, so you can leave Instagram!), select a directory, and then download! It <em>may</em> ask you to input a username and a password, which you can also input in the provided fields (I had to do this).</p>

<p>I don’t condone using this to be malicious in any way, shape, or form. But I do condone using it to pull all of your data off of Instagram so that you can use it elsewhere. And … I guess, also back it up, away from the prying eyes of Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>The source code is of course up on my github, but you don’t even need that in order to install anything. For the first time, <em>ever</em>, you can mess with one of my projects by just using a mainline Linux / Python command.</p>

<p>Hoorah.</p>

<p>It’s constructed in a way that, while downloading, it randomly spaces downloads out between 1 to 5 seconds, in order to avoid rate-limiting. I tested the app on multiple random profiles and never got rate-limited even <em>once</em>. Although, like all things, I’m sure it could still happen.</p>

<p>But for now, I sleep.</p>

<p>Now, load up your terminal and type in this:</p>

<p><code>
pip install gramload
