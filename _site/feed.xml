I’ve spent a lot of blog posts giving my own opinion on current events, or unfortunate advancements in tech that facilitate mass theft, or rolling my face on the keyboard in my Backrooms obsession. I suppose maybe sometimes it’s harder to write about myself, and what and how I’m feeling about things, because I find it hard to actually <em>want</em> people to know me.</p>

<p>It’s been over a decade and a half since I really started … “making things.” It’s been even longer since I dipped my toes into web development, and suddenly arrived at this point. It’s been just about as long that I’ve been working jobs that put money toward bills, and … I find myself wanting <em>more</em>.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, I just wanted to be a web developer. And, in a way, or sense, <em>I am</em>. But it’s not my <em>career</em>.</p>

<p>It should be. I basically <em>grew up</em> with a keyboard in my hands. <em>Why is this not my source of income?</em></p>

<p>Instead, I throw myself around in manual labor jobs and tell people what to do, and I pray every second for my weekend, or my time away from work. Time away, so I can do <em>what I really want to do</em>.</p>

<p>And it’s come to this point where, I look back at the time I spent in my early thirties where I kind of … <em>was</em> doing what I wanted to do. It just wasn’t making me any livable money. I wonder sometimes if I just didn’t try hard enough, or if I was <em>almost there</em>. I had a semi-popular album, and then catastrophe happened. I continue to write fiction, but at this point it’s mostly just a hobby. I run a store in Second Life, but it mainly only just <em>barely</em> pays for the Second Life subscription itself (even though, bringing in sales enough to do that for almost ten years within the virtual world is actually pretty impressive).</p>

<p>I look back at that, and wish I could try again, or <em>do it again</em>, but <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>I think I’ve realized this part of myself will <em>never be happy</em> until I am doing the concept of <em>this</em>, again, and <em>also</em> making a livable wage from it. For the longest time I thought I was at the end, or I thought I was as good as dead, and then everything changed and I made a whole lot of progress in life … only to wish I could go back.</p>

<p>I’m not burned out on making music, or building websites, or writing fiction, or anything else, besides … regular life. I hate the normalcy, and my brain pushes back against it every second of the day. And I’m living <em>two lives</em> because of it. The person I am at work? Basically a visage that doesn’t really exist. A fake me that puts on this face that <em>only</em> exists for eight hours, five days a week. I’m <em>so</em> cut off between these two worlds that I just about completely refuse to interact with anyone I know within the building, <em>outside of it</em>.</p>

<p>But I’m rambling about these nonstop streams of thought, and I just wanted to express, mostly? That something needs to change. It’s been a while. And maybe I’ve found <em>some</em> change in this little virtual reality space, VR Chat. But I need a bigger change. Whether that’s a web development career, or a solid, <em>actual</em> relationship, that doesn’t die out in months.</p>

<p>Heck, I dunno what it’s gonna be, but I know it’s coming.</p>

<p>Maybe I should write a resume for once?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a little while since I’ve written anything relating personally, to myself.

A fixation on a new kind of horror that is both hugely popular, and completely under-the-radar. Something I’ve written about numerous times now, including fictional speculation, and my most recent play-through of the Backrooms inspired Steam game, POOLS: Many have their ideas about the Complex, many people put out amateur content that is in the very least, <em>entertaining.</em> And then Kane Pixels, every so often, drops a nuclear horror bomb that redefines the Backrooms, <em>again</em>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acdYs9tPLko?si=Z869MvwMRWxLPcon" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But it’s not <em>just</em> the Backrooms, or the <em>idea</em> of it that makes it scary. It’s the liminal born horror of being in places where nothing lives. You walk through your house, you probably have hallways, and stairs. You don’t <em>live</em> in these spaces, but they exist, nonetheless. In the silence of the day or the night, you stand in these spaces, maybe at 2am, and you feel like it’s wrong. Maybe you don’t, maybe you do. You jump in your car at 3am and drive out on a lonely highway, and you stop at a seemingly empty gas station. Again, it probably feels … <em>off</em>.</p>

<p>That’s the liminality we’re talking here.</p>

<p>The Backrooms are the hallways in an empty home, the gas station late at night, the middle of nowhere on an empty road, <em>forever</em>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/posts/kanebackrooms/gasstation.png" />
</center>
<p><br />
It’s a concept I first learned and heard of, funnily enough, on <em>Tumblr</em>, years ago, and this is exactly the way it was described. Except it wasn’t horror, and there were no Backrooms (that came a bit later, via a single 4chan post).</p>

<p>A lot of random content on Youtube are cartoonish demons, and disembodied smiley faces, and then you stumble upon what I believe to be the <em>real</em> Backrooms. Everything ever made by Kane Pixels. The “howler,” the “bacteria”, and now, in FF3, whatever the <em>hell</em> that was. I think it’s speculated our new monster is a bacteria infected human, driven mad. But, unlike the other two “found footage” pieces in the evolving story that Kane’s been crafting, number three feels … too real. The distinction between the real world in the recording and 3D rendering, is completely unclear. It’s totally seamless. For a while, it seems as though <em>all of it</em> is a set piece that someone is <em>actually</em> walking through. And, for all intents and purposes, it very well could have been.</p>

<p>And then our camera-wielding buddy enters a lone home surrounded by walls, and … <em>speaks</em> to someone connected in reality. Something <em>not ever done</em> in Backrooms fiction before. And not only that, the protagonist “witnesses” the man he’s speaking to, falling directly into the same place, but somewhere else. And then you get an exposition from the cameraman as he takes in his last moments, right before the battery dies.</p>

<p>If this is <em>anything</em> like the movie, Hollywood won’t know what hit ‘em.</p>

<p>Some people call it boring walking simulation, or not even scary, and those people would be wrong. We’ve had Resident Evil, we’ve had Scream, and we’ve had The Ring. I think it’s time for the next evolution of horror. I don’t know why I say “I think it’s time,” I mean, it’s <em>already here</em>.</p>

<p>Just watch it. Most of it is unnerving, most of it is freaky and unsettling. But this newest offering goes even <em>deeper</em>. And I definitely mean that as a pun.</p>

<p>I find myself sometimes wondering what it would be like to suddenly break from the meandering regularity of my real life and “fall” directly into an endless labyrinth. I mean … aside from starving to death. Everyone in these found footage videos have what appears to be amazing courage. But I don’t think I could <em>ever</em>. I might sulk in a corner and wait, or just run and run and run until something hears me. Who knows! I don’t do well with empty and strange places where things could be following you in the dark.</p>

<p>But that’s my take on Kane Pixels’ Backrooms content, and the ridiculously good third found footage sequence.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Media" /><category term="media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the better part of a year, I’ve been absolutely raving about the Backrooms.

This is a new trend for me as I inch closer and closer to 40. But, I got up, slapped some food into a bowl for my cat, and then turned on the milquetoast social media, and immediately saw more aggravating takes from people who don’t deserve attention, or any money whatsoever. I’m talking about plagiarists who are desperate to be called authors; AI loving losers who think you should definitely expel energy to read things they didn’t even have the energy to write <em>themselves</em>.</p>

<p>This comes on the heel of more irritating news, as <a href="/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai">Mozilla ignores thousands and thousands of their users</a> criticizing their implementation of AI into Firefox (for no verifiable reason whatsoever), because <em>obviously</em> they’re more interested in the destruction of Mozilla, than continuing to be a privacy focused company. I have since moved to <a href="https://vivaldi.net" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>, a browser by a company that has pledged <em>not</em> to implement AI into their browser.</p>

<p>But, back to the point at-hand, I want to highlight this article specifically, because I can only take <em>so much</em> inauthentic douchebaggery before I have to really express my thoughts. And that’s saying a lot, because <em>most</em> of corporate social media feeds off of being inauthentic and <em>fake</em>.</p>

Opinion: Johnny Silverhand should materialize into the real world and explode AI content farms.</p>

<p>Let’s not even talk about the Threads account of a publication that has such a basic name that it’s gotta be AI generated (we’re … THE INFORMATION), but into the article itself where the featured image, some glossy ai-generated sludge, is attributed to the same guy who’s writing about how great it is to plagiarize actual writers in order to write a book. To add insult to injury, <em>you can’t even read</em> his word-vomit without <em>paying</em> him and/or the website for a subscription. Like the desperation of a teenager right before prom, these complete hacks who think they can technology their way into being a part of the creative world, they’re dead-set <em>determined</em> to make money off of you, somehow, some way.</p>

<p>So, <em>because</em> the article is paywalled and I’m too groggy to sift through their code in order to delete it, we’re just going to talk about the snippet you’re allowed to see before it cuts off and demands … ah, a minimum 300 dollars per year. Yeah, no. Put me in a Saw trap in a dirty bathroom, chained to a wall with a rusty bone saw and I’d sooner remove my own foot than pay you.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/ai2/monemoney.png" alt="a screenshot from the website the article is hosted on that asks for a minimum 299 per year in order to read their article, which is apparently discounted down from 399 USD." />

  <p>Tim Boucher is an artist and technologist who explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and human creativity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I set up a Google Alert on my name so long ago that I’d almost forgotten about it. It occasionally sends me stories about people in faraway places who share my first and last names. But the alert I received in mid-August was different.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I opened the email, I realized that this was really about me: My work had been referenced in a class action lawsuit against Anthropic, a leader in generative artificial intelligence. I am not party to the lawsuit, but it claims that my work is not real “writing” (scare quotes and all) and that I am not a real author, because I use generative AI, among other tools, to produce my books. No one involved in the lawsuit reached out to me for more information; I would have been happy to share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Tim Boucher is an artist.” I wouldn’t go that far, insulting artists by giving Tim credibility. But, right from the get-go, this guy is expressing his extreme need to feel important, or like he’s done something, by immediately detailing that he’s setup Google Alerts to let him know when people have mentioned his name online. Tim Boucher, come read what I’ve written about you, you fake piece of crap.</p>

<p>He starts out talking about how he was essentially being sued for using AI to pump out sludge-books. And, to whomever said his writing was not real, I applaud you. You should do it again.</p>

<p>Since that’s around where it cuts off, I’m assuming the article is less about Tim trying to feel validated in being a plagiarist hack, and more him writing a defense he’ll use in the court of law, where he’ll be forever shamed. I’m just going to use this as a jumping off point to share the rest of my feelings on this matter. A matter I wish wasn’t a matter, but we’re living in the worst and also most boring cyberpunk dystopia imaginable.</p>

<p>They’re <em>right</em>, Tim. You are not a real writer, you are not a real author, and you haven’t <em>done</em> anything of note.</p>

<p>Anyone who uses theft-tech to generate words that they can publish for a quick buck <em>is not a damn author</em>. You are no better than Microsoft Tech Support scammers ripping off elderly people of their retirement money. You have done <em>nothing</em>. You did <em>not</em> write anything. You used a machine that has scraped the entire internet of every word an actual human has written, in order to generate a discombobulation of words that you hope someone will think is interesting.</p>

<p>But I’m here to say, <em>fuck you.</em></p>

<p>It’s because of people <em>like you</em> that the world of self published writing will be <em>even worse</em> off, and will be continued to be considered <em>lesser</em> than big house publishing. Because of uncreative, <em>losers</em>, flooding the market, flooding apps with <em>shit</em>. Before, we were only competing with people who refuse to proofread. Now we’re competing with people who refuse to proofread, and <em>also</em> people who refuse to read <em>and</em> write.</p>

<p>I wish I was making this up.</p>

<p>I wish I hadn’t started writing my next book literal <em>months</em> before this started to become a problem. I <em>wish</em> I would’ve written it years ago, so that I could’ve gotten it out, and finished in an era where I could <em>still</em> share snippets and previews online, without needing to worry about machines taking every word and rearranging it for people who should go broke and live in the gutter.</p>

<p>That’s how I feel.</p>

<p>No-holds-barred, if you use AI to generate art and fiction, you deserve <em>the worst</em>. And no less than that.</p>

<p>Fortunately, like NFTs, AI is a bubble, and when it finally pops, the results will be amazing, hilarious, and great. And then the general internet will forget any of this happened three days later.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I woke up sprawled out on my couch because I once again passed out while watching Youtube.

I had a phone that could support … maybe three? One of them was the already very well-known Orc game, and the other was a little gacha called Illusion Connect. Okay, so, if you aren’t really interested in gachas, and you think buying stuff in them sucks, this probably isn’t all that interesting to you.</p>

<p>But, today it was revealed, that almost two years after it’s closure, Illusion Connect is returning this winter.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/connect/illusion.webp" /></p>

<p>This was my <em>main</em> mobile game for a long time. The thing is, like with most mobile games, I stop playing them for a while, and then I come back and continue. It’s a pattern with me, and not really any inherent issue with mobile games in-general. I treat triple-a desktop games exactly the same way. I’m super into Warframe, but I haven’t opened it in two weeks, because I just … have so much going on in my brain-juice.</p>

<p>So I had that little cooling off period, and after a while, I decided I wanted to open it up again and see how things were going. And then in December, 2022, it abruptly shutdown. Leaving you with nothing but an error screen as if it still exists, it just couldn’t connect to the servers.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been kind of meandering through these other gacha games that don’t really capture the same thing, or the same fun I had in my little phone game of anime girls. Albeit, Genshin, ZZZ, Wuthering Waves are all <em>great</em>. There’s just … something <em>also</em> good about a game that isn’t trying to be a huge open-world mega gacha experience. And that’s what Illusion Connect was. A simple thing you logged into, tapped some objectives, collected your stuff, pulled, and then logged off.</p>

<p>I like mobile games like that. Something I can open secretly while I’m walking through the halls at work, click a box, watch it open, and then shove my phone back into my pants.</p>

<p>But <em>anyway</em>, <a href="https://www.taptap.cn/moment/582294702590525813" target="_blank">here’s the announcement</a>.</p>

<p>For those who can’t read Chinese, (like me), here’s the translation:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Suffice to say, the developers have apparently been rebuilding the game, and that’s cool! It’s <em>cool</em> when an online game of sorts isn’t just <em>abandoned</em>, and instead worked on, rebuilt, and then relaunched, even <em>after</em> an unfortunate closure. A lot of big studios should take notes here …</p>

<p>Still mad I bought into The Matrix Online two decades ago in order to lose all my stuff, and my character, <em>forever</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was 2020, my rotation of mobile games included just two of them.

<p>Yesterday, on September 9th, 2024, it came across my timelines that Cohost, one of the few Tumblr alternatives, <a href="https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down" target="_blank">would be shutting its doors</a> at the end of the year, and going read-only on October 1st. I’ve been a <em>huge</em> advocate that people join and use <a href="https://app.wafrn.net" target="_blank">Wafrn</a> as a Tumblr alternative, <em>largely</em> due-in-part to the fact that Wafrn is fediverse connected, and therefore a lot of the stress of server costs are offloaded into that connection. Not only that, but should Wafrn ever close its doors, <em>every single user</em> is fine, since you can <em>just move</em> to another fediverse server, with most of your data in-tact. Despite all of that, it is sad to see something that <em>was</em> pretty cool, go away.</p>

<p>Since the beginning they’ve been proponents of … an isolated social experience, dressed up to look like a website from 1997. Which is cool (the part about looking like it’s from the nineties)! But, like I keep saying in every other post, federated social media controlled by users, and not corporations, <em>is the future</em>. Being regular people who aren’t a corporation who happened to get together as a group of 4, in order to develop a social media website, is pretty <em>neat</em>. I’ll give them that.</p>

<p>But, since the general vibe of Cohost has been to <em>avoid</em> federation, at all costs, and keep users within this walled-garden of sorts … well, I guess all that community building is <em>also</em> finished.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to rub salt in the wounds of people who are upset about this. Cohost was genuinely <em>good</em>. It definitely wasn’t Bluesky, which, since launching, has been nothing but a monster in the room that says and does questionable things, while other people pretend it’s the <em>only</em> choice. And, I actually <em>really</em> wanted to like and use Cohost, but I’m so <em>tied in</em> on federation, that it just made <em>no sense at all</em> to me to really take serious. Just like with SpaceHey, the Myspace revival project … I don’t really have any interest in sharing my thoughts, ideas, and projects on an isolated website, in 2024, just so I can also go share it on the website that <em>isn’t</em> isolated.</p>

<p>Reducing repetitive action is necessary, because, if you’re a creator, <em>you do stuff like this a lot</em>, and time isn’t cheap, and I don’t have a lot of it nowadays.</p>

<p>But, for people who are just online to share thoughts, and didn’t really have any other place they posted them in, I’m sorry. I wish I had a million dollars or two in order to save this website. It <em>really does suck a lot</em> to see the good ones go, when the bad places are still up and running and have yet to die (TWITTER!).</p>

<p>As an alternative action for those who I’ve seen via Cohost talking about how it was, to them, the only safe place online they felt they could express themselves, I <em>urge</em> you to create a website here on Neocities. It doesn’t even have to be professionally designed or <em>perfect</em>, but just make a website. Design it any way you please, and set it up in a way that allows you to speak. I think you’ll find that being able to share you thoughts on something you built, for free, and without threat of any servers dying is pretty fun. And, at the end of the day, everything you create for a website should be backed up on your PC, effectively making it impossible for your data to be destroyed (I also back up my websites in multiple cloud locations, just in case).</p>

<p>Those are my thoughts, though, aside from being confused at how Stripe’s policy change on tipping caused all of this. <em>Surely</em>, you could still offer a site-wide currency in order to generate revenue, and just give people who buy it some kind of fake little digital thing for their blogs so that it’s no longer a payment for what Stripe essentially sees as <em>nothing</em>. I don’t know, maybe the problem runs deeper than that.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tell Mozilla How You Feel About AI</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tell Mozilla How You Feel About AI" /><published>2024-09-09T17:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-09T17:03:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai.html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks!

<p>So, today I am unveiling, <a href="/linkgarden/for_you" target="_blank">LinkGarden</a>.</p>

<p>Plant your own garden … of links!</p>

<p><img src="/img/for-you/examples.png" style="align:center;" /></p>

<p>I detail the service on the page, but I’ll write about it here, as well, except, maybe in a more extended fashion. I’m offering this for eighty bucks. You pay me, then contact me, and I’ll get your page together, and even make you a Neocities where it can be hosted (hosted, completely for free). Of course, once I hand over the credentials, you’ll be responsible for changing your password. But, that’s a given!</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> request to use a custom domain, but this is a little more involved, in that, we’ll need to figure out if you’re buying the domain, and if you <em>know</em> how to setup the DNS. If not, I certainly know how to do this, but I <em>also</em> don’t have access to your domain admin panels.</p>

<p>I’m doing this, though, because, I want to show people that they can have all the frills of a Linktree, <em>without</em> a Linktree. I can do it for you, easy-peasy, and in about an hour.</p>

<p>Now, obviously, if you want <em>really</em> extensive, or more complicated stuff (more javascript, animated buttons that do more than just click and highlight, and so on and so forth), that would obviously take <em>more than an hour</em> to setup. Then, yes, we’ll have to negotiate pricing a little bit (right now my day job takes up so much of my time it’s ridiculous). Consider this though, if you currently pay monthly for a Linktree, or some other such service, and you’ve been doing so for a long time, how much have you paid them, in total? Probably less than what it’d cost for me to do this for you, right?</p>

<p>But I’m also doing this, because <em>you should</em> own your own piece of the internet. A place where a bunch of suits <em>aren’t</em> tracking your every move, where people can come and see what you’re all about, quickly, and easily. Maybe sometime in the future I’ll offer to build people entire websites! But, I don’t think that’s a venture I want to spend another ten hours preparing right now (I have some people in VR I want to visit tonight).</p>

<p>Once you have the page, and access to it, if you decide you want things changed, I can <em>also</em> do that. But, I <em>would</em> encourage buyers to look into the code used to build their link pages, and see if you can fiddle with changing things yourself (learning is fun!). I have them all setup with the simplest CSS and HTML possible, and if you use a program like VS Code, switching colors around in a CSS file is <em>even easier</em>. And, if you mess things up, I will have a backup of everything I do right here on my PC.</p>

<p>So, come on over, <em>and plant your own garden</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I spent the equivalent of around ten hours of work (on my day off, no less), designing and developing a new kind of “side service” I wanted to offer to people who: Don’t have the time, or don’t want to learn HTML and CSS, and who want to separate themselves from corporate media, just a little bit, even if it’s just to stop paying services like Linktree a monthly fee.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I Gave Buffer a Shot: I Have Thoughts</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/07/i-gave-buffer-a-shot-i-have-thoughts.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I Gave Buffer a Shot: I Have Thoughts" /><published>2024-09-07T21:59:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-07T21:59:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/07/i-gave-buffer-a-shot-i-have-thoughts</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/07/i-gave-buffer-a-shot-i-have-thoughts.html"><![CDATA[<p>A while back, I put up <a href="/social media/2024/07/31/bluesky-part-3-all-your-data-are-belong-to-us">a post about Bluesky</a> announcing their partnership with cross-posting company, “Buffer” (Yes, I’m aware that it’s starting to look like I have multiple topics that are an ongoing series on this website). I also detailed how this was a bad move, because Buffer is using OpenAI tech in their backend, and even though they <em>say</em> it’s just an option you can utilize with writing posts … based on how OpenAI has been conducting themselves, I don’t fully trust <em>any</em> company that thinks it’s a good idea to use their tech. Regardless, since I run a lot of different social media accounts, and I thought it could make things easier for me, like when I write blog posts, or have new music, I decided to give it a whirl!</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/posts.png" alt="screen from the Buffer website, showcasing organized posts I've made across Mastodon on a calendar." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The website itself is very well organized, you can connect your socials, and it even has a calendar that displays … <em>everything</em> you’ve ever posted on your connected accounts, chronologically by time and date (which … is actually pretty <em>worrying</em> if you don’t think they’re using that OpenAI tech ethically), and you can do a few other things. Such as, you can create a “start” page, which is just a rip of Link-tree. The downside, is that creating a Buffer version of Link-tree takes up one of your social connections.</p>

<p>But, how <em>many</em> are you allowed to connect on a free account?</p>

<p>Three.</p>

<p>Or, if you want a page with all your links provided by Buffer, essentially, you can connect <em>two</em> accounts.</p>

<p>So, basically, if you’re using the free Buffer plan, you may as well not even be there. If you can’t manage two accounts without the help of some software … geez, dude.</p>

<p>Okay, but how much does it cost to upgrade to have <em>more</em> connections.</p>

<p>Short answer: Way to goddang much.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>You can actually opt to start paying them fifteen dollars a month for the three accounts you’ve already connected, and have a few added features. Or, you can connect four accounts for twenty dollars, or five accounts for twenty-five dollars, or … a whopping fifty dollars for ten accounts! For a frame of reference, I have around eleven or twelve accounts I use across different networks, some alts, some not-so-much. They say, on the subscription page, that this is all “the most value for an individual creator …”</p>

<p>An <em>individual</em> creator? Paying, fifty dollars a month for ten accounts, <em>as long as you’re paying on a yearly basis</em>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/value.png" alt="A screenshot from the Buffer website depicting having to paying 600 dollars total, or 50 dollars a month, for the ability to connect 10 accounts to their service." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Bro …</p>

<p>Okay, so <em>obviously</em> this has gotta be some kind of marketing that’s specifically targeting creators who are <em>already</em> making money from what they do online. For fifty dollars a month, if paid yearly, or <em>sixty dollars</em> on a monthly basis, for <em>ten</em> accounts, you could, instead, subscribe to Apple+ and Netflix, and have some entertainment instead. And then just manage your accounts <em>yourself</em>. All with the added benefit of not potentially feeding everything <em>you’ve ever posted</em> into some OpenAI crap.</p>

<p>Which, take a look at this: Are mentioned <em>multiple</em> times on the publishing and scheduling box.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/ai.png" alt="A screenshot from the Buffer website's publishing window, depicting their AI assistant being mentioned twice just pixels away from each other." />
</center>
<p><br />
“Use AI assistant!” Also, did you want help publishing with the “AI Assistant?”</p>

<p>Because <em>everyone on social media knows</em> that using AI to generate your words totally doesn’t make you look like a completely fake tool-bag.</p>

<p>So, instead of using Buffer, I’ve opted to just manage the couple of accounts I use the most … <em>myself</em>. No, you guys aren’t getting fifteen, or twenty, or <em>fifty</em> dollars out of me.</p>

<p>But, I <em>did</em> really like their “start page” link aggregator. And, since they’re so hyper-vigilant about AI generated plagairism, I’m sure they won’t mind if I just … rip out the code of their link page, delete all the link trackers, place the CSS into its own file (because why the hell do you have it on the same page as the content?), rename all the modules to something humorous, enlarge the profile picture, increase the vertical size of the banner gif, change all of the colors, replace their icons with <a href="https://phosphoricons.com" target="_blank">Phosphor</a> icons, and replace their crappy static “update” section that doesn’t even serve clickable links, with … A live feed of my blog’s RSS (courtesy of Brenton Fletcher’s <a href="https://rss.bloople.net" target="_blank">rss.bloople.net</a>)</p>

<p>See it, here: <a href="https://nova.mkultra.monster/linkgarden/" target="_blank">CMDR Nova’s Linkgarden</a>.</p>

<p>Buffer version on the left, my version on the right.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/buffer2/links.png" alt="A screenshot of Buffer's link page versus my link page, styled similar, but also completely different." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>But here’s the thing, if you <em>really</em> want, or <em>need</em> a page of all of your links that you can easily just hand to someone like a business card, you can <em>build one yourself</em>, or, if you really don’t have the time, or want to learn HTML and CSS, I can just make it <em>for you</em>. I’m actually going to put together some examples of what a “linkgarden” could look like if I made one, and gave it to someone, and provide information on free hosting. Or, hey, maybe I could set that up for people too?</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>What I <em>do</em> know, is that you don’t have to pay companies continuously for something that can be made for you in a couple of hours, or that you can make <em>yourself</em> in a couple of hours, and then have <em>full control over</em>. And if you <em>really</em> need automated control of all of your accounts at once, I’m <em>sure</em> there’s a better way to do it, than paying some company that’s gone all-in on AI, six hundred dollars a mother-frikken <em>year</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, I put up a post about Bluesky announcing their partnership with cross-posting company, “Buffer” (Yes, I’m aware that it’s starting to look like I have multiple topics that are an ongoing series on this website).

Am I saying that Twitter has accidentally spawned masses of narcissists? Not really. I don’t think a website and its use for over a decade can alter someone’s brain chemistry. Or … can it?</p>

<p>But this is more about Bluesky, because, yes, again, we are seeing some undue angst and toxicity being slung toward the federated social network revolving around ActivityPub, or more exclusively, Mastodon, <em>because a lot of these people don’t know about</em> and <em>don’t care to</em> discover the rest of it. I’ve seen this happen <em>pretty much</em> every other day since Twitter had its last excursion, and then the more recent Brazilian excursion. People, basically, celebrating what they themselves believe to be a <em>better</em> platform, and for all intents and purposes, they can do that (even if that platform is a corporate owned entity no better than Twitter)! But, for whatever reason, it’s <em>always</em> followed by also dunking on people who are minding their own business on the Fediverse. For …</p>

<p>Reasons!</p>

<p>I want to preface this with something, before I dive into the biggest offenses I’ve seen: I was invited to join Bluesky back when the doors were still closed. Back when it was still an exclusive club, and being more familiar with Mastodon, than Bluesky, I was pretty used to … let’s say, people kinda more actually giving a shit about what they say, when they say it, and how they address others. Much to my dismay, I quickly learned that this is <em>not</em> the average Bluesky experience. Because I didn’t save any screenshots from when it happened, and I don’t feel like reliving every intricacy of what exactly went on, I’ll be brief, and explain as simply as possible what took place.</p>

<p>I started following people in and adjacent to the LGBTQ+ community, and, as you know, some people like to post with complete abandon, and zero regard. A “popular” account, attached to a, then, popular block and mute list creator, used a slur to describe people like her, and people like me, openly, just right on the timeline. Feeling kind of jolted by this, and largely due-in-part to some trauma I’ve had in the past, I asked if it was completely necessary to do that. Or, if some kind of warning could’ve happened (no, I am not talking about the word “Queer”, just so we’re straight on that).</p>

<p>This was, apparently, <em>not the right thing to ask</em>.</p>

<p>It was my first <em>week</em> on Bluesky, and I was dogpiled, I was harassed, I was <em>mocked</em> for being traumatized by past events that I had no control over, because of who I was, and how I presented myself to the world (you know, instances of events where harm did, or could have come upon my person).</p>

<p>I had multiple users jump <em>directly</em> into my notifications to make sure I knew that <em>nobody cares</em> about how I feel, about my <em>feelings</em>, and that my experiences mean nothing. That I am alone, and I have to deal with it myself, while others speak, and do as they please.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, I was a mess around this point. I was kind of … reeling. Flashbacks, trauma, anxiety; Feeling like I’d just joined a social network absolutely <em>full</em> of sociopaths.</p>

<p>Flash forward a year, and both of those original accounts have been pushed off of the website, because, you guessed it: They’re both abusive people that were given too much benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p><strong>Who could have guessed.</strong></p>

<p>Now: Could I have avoided all of this by just <em>unfollowing</em> the offending account or accounts? Sure. But also I don’t think it’s a lot to ask that people take harmful things, and put them behind a warning. Which is something that usually happens on Mastodon, because, I guess, a larger number of Mastodon users care about other people more than your average Bluesky user?</p>

<p>I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to generalize a whole website of people. But! Impressions were made, and <em>set</em>.</p>

<p>Now, here we are today. Another gaggle of people rejoicing at the growth Bluesky is experiencing due to X being banned in Brazil. Which is good! A website that is owned and operated by a corporate entity, and sponsor, <em>needs</em> growth in order to eventually make money. And, like clockwork, with all of that <em>also</em> comes the random dunking of people who use a much older federated network, that’s been around since the internet took off. You already know what I’m talking about, so we’ll just dive right into this, again (I posted about this on my Mastodon account, but I feel like it needed more picking apart).</p>

<center>
<img alt="an image where a Bluesky user asserts that compiling a Linux kernel is easier than joining Mastodon" src="/img/posts/busky3/kernal_hard.png" />
</center>

<p><br /></p>

<p>As a lot of people who read what I write here probably already know, I’m <em>very</em> passionate about the deconstruction of centralized social media, and the corporate internet. So much so, that I have two machines that run Linux, one that runs MacOS, and none that run Windows. Most of my online activity is on some <em>kind</em> of open-source software, and the corporate tech I <em>do</em> interact with is … limited, and usually only for the benefit of what I create, or compose, or make.</p>

<p>Now, I <em>use</em> Linux, and I am by no means a Linux genius, so when I see someone talking about compiling a Linux kernel, I’m not entirely sure how they’d accomplish that. I’ve never done it, nor ever considered it. But! I am under the impression that you <em>need some</em> knowledge of the C programming language, and its compilers.</p>

<p>Imagine saying that you need a degree in computer science to choose a Mastodon instance, and to make sure you’re choosing one with a competent moderation policy, and fully meaning that, wholeheartedly, with a straight face. And to say that in response to someone, <em>basically</em> saying that, your onboarding process for a social network needs to be entirely smooth, without friction, or people will immediately abandon it and just give their data back to their corporate overlords.</p>

<p>I <em>don’t want</em> to believe that a mass majority of people are so intellectually <em>lazy</em> that they’d refuse to spend sixty seconds looking at the splash page of a Mastodon instance and going, “Hmm. Okay, so they ban nazis and they’re okay with gay and trans people, awesome!” I <em>do</em> want to believe that this is just a popular narrative among people who have little specific agendas in mind, but that’s probably too conspiracy theorist to even begin speaking about.</p>

<p>Like I said in my Mastodon post on this topic, <em>leaving Twitter behind</em> is already creating friction in your social media existence. That a little more is too much, is just ridiculous. People are more happy to jump directly into the arms of another corporation, because all they have to do is write down a username and a password and then forget about it?</p>

<p>Nah, you can’t be <em>serious</em>, my guy.</p>

<p>But, this all isn’t even the biggest offense in what’s essentially a huge thread of people dunking on the fediverse, again, <em>for no reason</em> (I would link to it, but I honestly deactivated my mainline Bluesky account after seeing all of this and I have no interest in visiting their domain, again).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>This</em>. This freakin’ attitude again.</p>

<p>“Other people’s feelings aren’t my problem! I don’t care about THEM?! GOD.”</p>

<p>Do you know how difficult it is to push the “CW” button on Mastodon, and then type your post?</p>

<p>It’s not hard.</p>

<p>It’s also not hard to consider other people when you’re going about your daily life and making decisions.</p>

<p><em>It is not hard</em>. You cannot convince me that it is.</p>

<p>All this continued attitude from Bluesky proves to me, is that Mastodon users … somehow care <em>more</em> about the people around them, than <em>maybe</em> your average user on Bluesky. Which is fucked up. Because the Fediverse has its own issues with nazi instances cropping up at random, and abusive people block evading, and so on, and so forth. But to <em>think</em> it’s a DUNK, that on Bluesky, you’re <em>not expected</em> to express empathy for others.</p>

<p>Guys.</p>

<p>Guys, I think I’m gonna barf into my shoes, and then piss my pants.</p>

<p>I’m just <em>utterly</em> confused about how we’ve gotten to this point. <em>to this crossroads</em>, where two different websites are having fights with each other, and one of the <em>main</em> points of argument is that … it’s too hard to care about other people.</p>

<p>I dunno, fellas, maybe I was right in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I don’t really want much to do with Bluesky, and I’m <em>sure</em> there are perfectly normal and perfectly fine people on the website. But, for the past <strong>year</strong> this has been a trend, an attitude, that I have <em>only seen</em> coming from Bluesky.</p>

<p>That’s a red flag.</p>

<p>A continuous, never-ending red flag, that just keeps waving and waving.</p>

<p>I <em>can’t wait</em> for the “I deleted my Bluesky account today” posts that will inevitably begin cropping up across the Fediverse. Because, federated social media and the federated internet, <em>is the future</em>, whether Jay at BSKY wants to acknowledge it, or not.</p>

<p>You remember a while back when <a href="/gaming/2024/05/22/pools">I wrote that post on POOLS</a> about how awesome and good I thought the game was? Well, I got to chapter two around that time, and decided to stop playing for a while. Not because the game was <em>bad</em> or anything, but just because it gets under you skin way too easily. Eventually, though, I <em>had</em> to come back, and I <em>had</em> to complete it.</p>

<p>And that I did.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pools2/2.png" alt="image of another pool room that's shrouded in darkness, with larger than life mannequin heads jutting from the floor, mouths open" /></p>

<p>I’m going to spoil a bunch of stuff here, but I’m assuming that’s okay, because Backrooms related games and media are kinda niche, and when it comes to horror, this is especially niche.</p>

<p>Usually, when I tried to play this game, I would do it late at night, in complete silence … for some <em>reason</em>. And that made it pretty hard to work my way through. Don’t even get me started on The Complex: Expedition. Despite its harmless entity (that I know of), I find that game <em>just</em> as terrifying.</p>

<p>It’s all the low humming, the scratches, the howling of dark wind in an endless tunnel.</p>

<p>But I did it.</p>

<p>I pushed through, with my pinky on the shift key, the entire time.</p>

<p>There were freaky moments. Funny moments. And sometimes, awe-inspiring moments.</p>

<p>And then it came to an end, with the silent protagonist setting their camera down upon a table, mannequins encroaching upon you from one of two paths behind you, and another arm holding a door open. But then the view cuts to a recording, the door shuts, and whoever’s viewing the tape of your actions hits the stop button, and credits roll.</p>

<p>Pretty <em>confusing</em>, right?</p>

<p>I don’t think so.</p>

<p>Throughout POOLS, there is a lot of imagery. It’s, of course, <em>based</em> on the Backrooms. And the pool rooms <em>are</em> a level known in the liminal maze. Some may also know it as Sublimity (you also get a glimpse of the actual Backrooms in POOLS, along with some other pieces of levels dreamed up by the fandom, such as Eternal Suburbia). The developers though, they only say it’s <em>based</em> on the Backrooms, and I think I understand why we’re making that distinction here. Because it <em>is</em> the backrooms, but it’s also something else.</p>

<p>It’s a work of art.</p>

<p>It’s purgatory.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pools2/4.png" alt="image of a hallway that doesn't look at all unlike the actual backrooms" /></p>

<p>It’s an allegory for abuse, and the victim of that abuse <em>fighting to escape it</em>, and <em>failing</em>. Fighting in isolation, and trauma, reminded at every turn what they did to you, and when there’s a light at the end of the tunnel and you think you’re finally out of the never-ending spiral, <em>it goes out</em> and disappears. And then the darkness pulls you back in.</p>

<p>Where does this inkling come from, though? Some have already said that they believe this to be an allegory for such things. That this <em>has</em> to be about abuse, or <em>something</em>. I think someone even mentioned they thought it was about CSA, due to some depictions of a child’s drawings on the walls, big black letters scrawled across a picture that reads, “NOTHING,” a single lonely house that appears to you toward the end, and then endless copies of it, and the appearance of very large mannequins screaming, viewing other mannequins in compromising, embarrassing positions, pointing, staring, mouth-agape in horror.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pools2/3.png" alt="a mannequin sitting on a toilet holding its head in shame in a white tiled environment while another stands upon a balcony overhead and stares" /></p>

<p>Whatever <em>type</em> of abuse it is, I think this game is definitely telling a story, whether real or fiction, and it’s all right in front of you the whole time.</p>

<p>The innocent rubber ducks sitting around in the water that are somehow <em>terrifying</em>. The pool slides that seem to be in random places that beg to be jumped into, as absurd as that is, while you’re lost in a horrifying complex.</p>

<p>The mixture of innocence, and despair.</p>

<p>Of lightheartedness, and terror.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pools2/5.png" alt="image of a lonely house in a room with painted skies and clouds, and a slide attached to its side paneling" /></p>

<p>POOLS takes something that really has no meaning, other than to terrify, and turns it into something that has … a very <em>deep</em> message. Something you have to decode <em>yourself</em>, or not. It’s entirely up to the player, I think. And that’s one more thing that just makes this game <em>so good</em>.</p>

<p>I could be <em>entirely wrong</em>, though, and this could be one of many ways to interpret the game. And that’s okay. Because POOLS isn’t <em>just</em> a game, it’s a work of art, and it asks that you experience it. Nothing more.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
