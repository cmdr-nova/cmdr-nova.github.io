Zuck is storing your info, selling it to advertisers, and using it to tailor ads to you to be ever-more invasive in your digital life. And, you know, who <em>knows</em> what else. If you’re nearing the age of 40, like me, you’ve probably <em>already</em> had a Facebook account, and can probably also remember when it first opened its doors to the masses (oh god, am I old?) But, <em>should you be there</em>? Is it too late?</p>

<p>Everyone knows I <em>love</em> Mastodon, despite the issues I’ve had with a handful of instances who have treated my presence … not so well. The open internet, tied to protocols and Linux, <em>is the future</em>. And there’s no way around that. So much so, Meta recognizes this, and is <em>still</em> actively working on its full integration of ActivityPub (even though many see it as a ploy to vacuum up the data of fediverse users).</p>

<p>Despite that, <em>many</em> instances are blocking Threads.net. My instance wasn’t, and then was, and now isn’t, again. Why?</p>

<p>I’m someone who sort of, subjects my online presence to testing new things, and then writing about it, on sort of a frequent basis. If you’re reading this, and you’ve been reading my blog for a while now, you probably remember when I jumped into Nostr for a while … and then later discovered that, despite a few cool people, it’s mostly just Bitcoin addicts, and extremists who want to say slurs, unhindered. And you also probably already know, I’ve tried Bluesky multiple times, to the tune of being harassed by jerks on multiple occasions, for seemingly <em>no reason</em>.</p>

<p>And I remain an instance admin on ActivityPub, despite its personal cost to my wallet, because I feel this is the <em>best</em> answer to my online presence … or is it?</p>

<p>I recently shared a post on Threads that currently has half a million views and 1,600 likes. That’s … <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve also been sharing my work, and then things I do, on Mastodon, for <em>months</em>, uh … <em>years</em>, actually. And, for a while, I could say that most of the support I <em>ever</em> see for any of my work, be it music, coding, or writing, has been <em>from Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>But, I can’t deny, that lately, in the past couple of months, it’s starting to look like that may no longer end up being the case. Albeit, I haven’t really shared much of my work on Threads, but if a post in support of Luigi Mangione can get half a million impressions, then <em>surely</em> I could find a way to put my next album, or book, in front of just as many eyes.</p>

<p>Which brings me to an impasse.</p>

<p>I’m very stringent about committing to Linux, committing to open source, and privacy, and <em>taking back</em> the internet. But, at exactly the same time, I want to make a future for myself that involves the extracurricular work that I do at home <em>becoming</em> my main source of income. And if I’m seeing <em>months</em> of next to <em>no</em> reaction to those things on the platform that I <em>actually</em> want to commit to, what am I supposed to think?</p>

<p>Do I just <em>really suck</em> at being interesting? Are the things I do just not interesting to the average Joe, or average Mastodon user?</p>

<p>Of course, I’m not <em>just</em> on Mastodon to share my work. I’m there to talk. connect, build, make friends. But it’s also <em>very</em> important that what I do is <em>seen</em> by people, you know? And this isn’t to say that there’s <em>no one</em> on Mastodon. There are plenty of people there. Somewhere around 15-20 million people.</p>

<p>And then <em>also</em> at the same time, that post with half the population of a town viewing it, this hasn’t really resulted in any … results? For my presence there? I don’t have half a million follows. I’m not noticing a huge uptick in traffic to my website.</p>

<p>Just now someone on Mastodon tells me, that Meta clout is more akin to gambling, than anything. And you know, that’s probably completely correct.</p>

<p>I don’t know. Maybe it’s something that I’m overthinking. Maybe <em>I should</em> walk away from Meta. But, as much as I’m capable of doing my offline job <em>now</em>, I may not always be capable, and eventually I’m going to need something else. And I really need that something else to be the things I’ve already been doing, for <em>years</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="threads" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="meta" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of good arguments as to why you shouldn’t be on Threads, or any Meta-owned social media, for that matter.

Either way, corporate social media (Threads) has an algorithm, and that algorithm has decided that on Christmas Eve (Happy holidays!), that I should be shown the scum of the Earth, who believe there are people who shouldn’t be able to afford to live if they’re working one of <em>those jobs</em> (italics, if you’re reading from Mastodon). We’re talking all of the jobs where people were called Essential in 2020 while they worked through what was called a deadly virus. A virus that is, for sure, <em>still out there</em>.</p>

<p>Jobs that absolutely should have been compensated with hazard pay.</p>

<p>I’m talking restaurant jobs, service jobs, big box store jobs. Basically, anything that aids in the procurement of food and water for the rest of the population … some of which, who take this for granted, because their world doesn’t expand beyond the tip of their noses.</p>

<p>Instead of amplifying the voices of people who don’t deserve to be able to say things online, I just want to point out that the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage debate <em>has gone on for so long</em> that the <em>actual</em> living wage is more like 30+ dollars an hour in 2024 (going on 2025). Corporations have hiked prices so high, and landlords are abusing the fact that there are <em>zero consequences for their actions</em>, so much, that 15 dollars an hour, <em>now</em>, would be like making 7 dollars an hour in 2015.</p>

<p>It’s no longer adequate.</p>

<p>The idea that <em>some people</em> should live in poverty, just because the lucky few had 100,000 dollars to spend on college, or were a trust-fund baby, is horrid, and outdated, and it’s about high-time we tie the living wage to the <em>cost of living</em>, and so-called inflation (see: greedflation).</p>

<p>But even <em>if</em> every single person on Earth, alive today, went to college, became doctors, engineers, astronauts, and so on and so forth, <em>there would still need to be people serving the food you eat, and stocking the shelves</em>. Hence, <em>Essential Workers</em>.</p>

<p>You take that away, and society collapses.</p>

<p>Some joke that these jobs will be replaced by robots, and I welcome that! Displace billions of people, and see what happens next.</p>

<p>I dare you.</p>

<p>Anyway, happy chrimas, and have a merry chrysler.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="blogging" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="politics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I happen to visit corporate social media on a regular basis, as I’m trying to build multiple platforms, because I’d like to traditionally publish a book, if I’m lucky enough, in a one out of a million chances I have at doing so.

So much so, trolls have had a laugh at my expense because of it, because, as <em>we all know</em>, Windows is totally superior, with its built-in ads, built-in AI, built-in (or soon to be) digital snoop, built-in forcing you to use Edge and making it so even if you use a different browser you have to tick a thousand boxes that say “open [file extension] in my new browser, instead.” And then there’s MacOS, which I <em>also</em> use, because I have a Macbook, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch, and the entire Homekit thing with the yellow ball that speaks words to me if I say “Hey Siri, what’s it like outside right now?” Which is fine! Because MacOS is <em>also</em> Unix.</p>

<p>It’s a purely <em>locked down</em> and extremely secure version of Unix, so-much-so that if you try and watch <em>any</em> streaming app on an external monitor through MacOS, the whole screen goes blank.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I wanted to write a plea to Apple, because they <em>definitely</em> read my blog (see: sarcasm), because, it’s almost 2025. No average person is pirating anything anymore. I’m pretty sure most gen z and alpha kids/adults have no idea what the phrase “pirating a movie” even means. <em>Nobody is recording shows and movies through a capture device on a secondary monitor</em>. So, can we please, let me watch Apple TV on my second, much larger monitor? I <em>pay you</em> to be able to watch Severance. The least you could do is <em>let me watch it on my big honkin’ monitor</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, I could turn on my Apple TV box but that takes WORK. I gotta use my CONTROLLER. I gotta switch the inputs.</p>

<p>Anyway, though, why use <em>both</em> Linux and MacOS?</p>

<p>Linux is great for pretty much a lot of things. Notice, I didn’t say <em>everything</em>. I like it for security and data ownership. I like it for all of the things I can do with it, that it absolutely won’t stop me from doing. I like it because my Linux PC is a beef-master 5000 and I can play Diablo 4 at max FPS (which is about the only game I play nowadays).</p>

<p>But, because I have all these millions of Apple devices, turning on my laptop and plugging into my larger display allows me to write while listening to my Apple music library that isn’t being displayed through a built-in web UI (I’m talking about the flatpaks via Linux). I can see all my texts coming through on my desktop, work on writing my book in the Pages app I’ve been using for over a year, and I can use Affinity!</p>

<p>I dumped Photoshop a long time ago, after they went face-first into AI, and started up with the predatory subscriptions. And Affinity is probably the <em>greatest</em> alternative.</p>

<p>But there’s no Linux port. And a dev told me directly they have <em>no plans to support Linux</em>.</p>

<p>Which is a huge bummer. In fact, it’s kind of … dumb. I almost swore off their entire software suite, because <em>you’ve already developed this software for MacOS,</em> which is a variation of UNIX!</p>

<p>Regardless …</p>

<p>If I somehow blew your mind that MacOS is in fact Unix based, and you don’t believe me, open up Terminal on your Mac. Create a simple bash script. I dunno, something that says “Hello world!” To do this, type “nano hello.sh”, and within that new file, type in “#!/bin/bash”, and then press enter. Now type “echo “Hello world!” Now, press ctrl + O, and then ctrl + X. Lastly, type in chmod +x hello.sh (or whatever you name your bash script). Now! Run it! Type in “./hello.sh”</p>

<p>And voila.</p>

<p>All of the things you just did are exactly how you’d accomplish the same thing in Linux. You probably thought, “Wait, what the heck? Nano is included in MacOS?”</p>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to the world of only Unix based machines.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Computing" /><category term="linux" /><category term="mac" /><category term="computing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a real big into Linux kinda person.

But, Bluesky was an unwelcoming hellscape when it required invite codes to join, and it’s <em>still exactly that</em>, except now it has millions of people on it. Of course, there’s the drama surrounding Jesse Singal’s presence on the network, and some trans woman who made a bot that made a trust and safety team member’s porn likes full-public-facing, but this isn’t really about that. At least not right now.</p>

<p>I’m going to be fully transparent, again, like I always am: I came out as trans in 2012, and I began transition in that same year. Things were rough, because I was at this pivotal position in life where I didn’t know who I wanted to be, and I didn’t know <em>who I was</em>, and I was suffering from anxiety <em>already</em>, before I jumped in. I made mistakes with my family, and things got dark for a while (they aren’t anymore). I lost my job because of harassment I had been enduring, and HR’s inability to take any action whatsoever. It transformed me into someone with crippling anxiety, and that of a person who <em>could not function</em> in public.</p>

<p>My first interactions with the trans community were on Reddit, where people posted photos of their faces and asked how well they “pass,” and people would routinely tear others down and talk about things that are either very hard to change, or can’t change at all. I had people telling me they liked my face before transition more than in the midst of it, and all of these experiences kind of setup my mindset for the following five years that went by (including the stalker I gained from the aforementioned subreddits).</p>

<p>I didn’t, and <em>never had</em> any community offline. Every trans woman I came into contact with in offline spaces ended up causing me some kind of pain, or heartbreak, for whatever reason. A girl in Philadelphia who used me for a day as a ride around town while she spouted off racist remarks about random people passing us by. A girl in West Virginia who is, coincidentally, also currently posting on Bluesky, who used me to make her ex girlfriend jealous, and then viciously abused me by pretending to attempt to take her own life over the phone, <em>to me</em>. Another who was a locksmith at the time, who I saw on and off for over a year, who ended our time together by telling me that I wasn’t “dating material.” After, again, <em>well over a year</em>.</p>

<p>I met someone I knew from Twitter for coffee, and she proceeded to never speak to me again, afterward, only because, I’m assuming, I didn’t ask to see her again.</p>

<p>And then there was the detransed person I knew from my job at the time, who was <em>one of the most horrible people</em> I’ve ever known, and had the displeasure of interacting with.</p>

<p>It’s safe to say, there’s no such thing as community offline. Or, at least, <em>there never was</em>.</p>

<p>Online, it wasn’t much better.</p>

<p>I came into contact with Laurelai Bailey, and in my extremely vulnerable state, I was manipulated, and then held emotionally and psychologically hostage for <em>years</em>, and I think this was a major contributor to my inability to ever <em>belong</em> to a community of any sort (Bailey has an extremely long paper-trail of being a social parasite online, among other things. Such as a rapist, and an FBI snitch).</p>

<p>I tried to find community on Tumblr, which didn’t happen, because Tumblr is <em>very bad</em> at actually connecting people together who have the same interests, and there were more bigots on Tumblr, than anything. I tried to find community on Twitter, and found endless toxic popularity contests and mean-girling. I tried to find community on Mastodon, and in my constant turmoil, I was banned, and then banned again (kitty.town), and then banned again (deadinsi.de), and then banned again (cybre.space)–Every single time someone decided to troll me, or attack me for my views, or how I looked, or what-have-you. I do not have good experiences with third-party fedi admins. Which is why I now run my own instance (tech bros who run instances routinely villianize those who are being attacked, rather than villainize the people <em>doing</em> the attacking).</p>

<p>I became part of the Twitter synthwave scene, and found <em>some</em> kind of community, albeit, it wasn’t a <em>trans community</em>. It was mostly men, who, years after, I realize were only tolerating my presence. Suffice to say, despite having a bestselling dark-synth album, I was ejected from that community after <em>exactly one</em> complaint against a transphobic comment, to the response of hundreds of people within Twitter-synthwave dogpiling and harassing me. I was muted and blocked by streaming radio stations, and my label (at the time), seemingly vanished from the internet completely. Then I was, again, on my own.</p>

<p>This kind of coincides, or leads up to me being banned from hackers.town on Mastodon, but that was more of the same in regards to what I’ve already mentioned: Tech bros and their sycophants, with backwards ideologies in regards to harassers and victims.</p>

<p>And you might be asking yourself at this point, “What’s this got to do with Bluesky?”</p>

<p>You see, I have to give some backstory here (and there is <em>so much more</em> to it than this), because it won’t make sense if I don’t.</p>

<p>I joined Bluesky over a year ago (as of posting this), because I finally got an invite code, and despite putting my transition on pause (which I could probably argue is more to do with severe anxiety and fear than anything else), I <em>still</em> wanted to find <strong>community</strong>. Which, at this point, I’m almost certain does not exist, <em>anywhere</em>. But, the problem with Bluesky, is that it has attracted all of the people who made Twitter shitty back in 2014: Harassers, narcissists, and self-described “mean girls.”</p>

<p>I recall a block list operator on Bluesky (who eventually got pushed off of the platform) who posted along with someone at the bsky domain “benni.gay” or something? And this Bennie, was, or <em>still is</em>, one of those strange people who not only identify with violent slurs, but regularly post them. We’re talking about “tranny” here. And me, with all of this disgusting backstory of nonstop bullshit, comes into contact with this person, and <em>of course</em> my reaction was, “Hey can you <em>not</em> do that.”</p>

<p>And, you know, since, <em>apparently</em> new-gen trans people have decided that slurs <em>aren’t</em> slurs, and I <em>still</em> get much, <em>much</em> younger trans women <em>on Bluesky</em> questioning me like, “What do you mean <strong>tranny</strong> is a slur?” I can only assume that there is an extreme lack of education in these faux online communities. But!</p>

<p>I questioned this person, and before tossing her a mute, I felt it was courtesy to at least ask or say, “Can we not post these kinds of words without a warning of some sort?”</p>

<p>You know what happened next. You already know.</p>

<p>Dogpiling, harassment, vicious narcissism, and violent denial of lived experience.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I <em>originally</em> deleted my account because of this, and joined Threads for a while, to begin normal-posting. And then, after a while, I launched my own Mastodon instance, and herein began where we are today, a year later.</p>

<p>But, you see, Bluesky has been gaining popularity, so … why not try again?</p>

<p>Oh, well, okay. So that was a bad idea.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bsky-again-times-two/ugh.png" /></p>

<p>And you can probably already guess, this lead to … harassment! Dogpiling! And eventual block-listing!</p>

<p>Maybe there’s something wrong <em>with me</em>. Maybe I’m too chill, or I give people too much benefit of the doubt. Maybe I’m emotionally non-existent, <em>because</em> of my history, and therefore can’t really see this coming anymore. Or, maybe online communities, especially and specifically those revolving around trans communities, <em>aren’t good and are very bad, actually</em>.</p>

<p>To be part of one of these communities, you have to subject yourself to bad jokes, labeling yourself with slurs that violent attackers <em>have actually used against you</em>, right before attempting to snatch you out of the driver side seat of your car (this happened, to me), and all-around act like a petulant, vapid psychopath, with no morals, or qualms with anything <em>unless it affects you directly</em>.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas, mother-freakers.</p>

<p>I stay on Mastodon, despite the numerous failures of admins across different instances, because it’s an online experience that I can <em>completely control</em>, while running my own instance, and <em>own</em> community. And even if nobody ever joins mkultra.monster, at least I can’t be ejected from my own platform for having the audacity to have feelings about things, and morals.</p>

<p>But I do think, at this point, Bluesky is beyond a failed experiment, because all it does is emulate the worst parts of Twitter, before Twitter became <em>only the worst parts</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="toxicity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t post about this when it happened, because, honestly, I’m unsure how much attention I want to give toxic people, and, after so many years of this being routine from people with Main Character Syndrome (see: narcissism) on social media, it’s tiring.

You’ve written like 800 babillion things on this website!” And while that <em>may</em> be true, I’ve also got three books on the burner I’ve started and never finished. My next and upcoming book, Dissolution Protocol, <em>especially</em>. Having just read over everything I’ve written for it so far, I realize I uh, didn’t get that far. And now I want to continue … but, how do you share and raise awareness around written fiction in the age of plagiarism?</p>

<p>I’m fairly confident that I can share snippets of things on Mastodon, and not worry all that much about my work being vacuumed up by a machine for use in some soulless idiot’s money-making scheme, but where else can you go? Forums are probably a no, and <a href="https://lemmy.zip/post/22031416" target="_blank">even NaNoWriMo are now AI shills</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s the <em>problem.</em> I nearly entirely gave up writing fiction, the second I found out that these machines were going online to scrape the whole internet for the sole purpose of profiting off of other people’s work. I mean, how do you respond to that, as someone who <em>makes</em> things, with <em>your own hands?</em></p>

<p>Frankly, I responded by saying, “Well screw it, I’m not doing <em>anything</em> then.”</p>

<p>But I <em>can’t</em> just do nothing.</p>

<p>It drives me mad.</p>

This was seen as a very bad move, and it sucked tons of butt. In response to this move, some developers descended upon ActivityPub, and created an alternative, or, <em>a clone of Reddit</em>, that operates on AP, and looks exactly the way it did in 2013. This could be a plus, or a minus, depending on who you are and what you like. Also, for a while now, I’ve been running a script on a VPS that posts random images from select subreddits, to Mastodon. But! Not anymore. Now that script uses Lemmy.</p>

<p>The great thing about Lemmy’s API, is that it requires <em>absolutely no API keys or credentials.</em> You only need your Mastodon account developer credentials, and you’re pretty much already done. I modified my Reddit script, because I want to begin promoting ActivityPub even more-so, now that the owners behind Bluesky have decided that, in record time, they’d like to enshitify their platform. Which, <em>also</em> spawned a <a href="https://hexbear.net/" target="_blank">brand new Lemmy instance</a> as some user’s response to that.</p>

<p>You can grab <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/lemmy-bot" target="_blank">my script here</a>, and deploy it in about 5 minutes on your own VPS. And I recommend using a VPS, or some kind of environment that can’t easily be accessed by the public, unless you want your Mastodon credentials to be public (this can be altered to use the environment, but I haven’t done that because I’m lazy).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="lemmy" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="activitypub" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As some may know, back when the Reddit devs/CEO decided to follow Musk’s decision-making like a lost puppy dog, they restricted their API and killed a ton of third-party apps.

Destroyed, as in, as soon as you launch it, it closes itself. But, there’s a work-around …</p>

<p>The issue, is that, apparently, in the latest update a few days ago, due to <a href="https://jira.firestormviewer.org/browse/FIRE-34877" target="_blank">recent changes with regard to Mesa drivers</a>, Firestorm no longer works. There <em>is</em> a fix on the way, but, as we know, these fixes could take … any infinitely guessable amount of time to hit your machine. It could be tomorrow, it could be in 3 weeks, it could be in 3 months. Who knows! I’m personally running Pop!_OS, and my Firestorm updates come, <em>sometimes</em>, weeks after they’ve been released.</p>

<p>As someone who is running multiple stores in Second Life, and has some other things I need to look after on a daily basis, this is no bueno.</p>

<p>But, also, if you’re on Linux, you might like to game? You might dabble in a little pew pew, and a little fictional love triangle? Well, do I have news for you.</p>

<p>Open up Lutris. If you don’t have it, <em>get it</em>. Use Flatseal to make sure it has access to all of your drives (just in case you don’t want to install things to your main hdd). Search for Firestorm, install that motherfreaker. Boom.</p>

<p>Launch it.</p>

<p>You’re back in Second Life.</p>

<p>For now.</p>

<p>Until the Mesa, or Firestorm devs break <em>something else</em>.</p>

<p>I figured I would share this, though, because the amount of Linux users out there are growing. Growing, as Microsoft continues to transform Windows into a vehicle for malware and spam.</p>

<p>I was willing to give up Call of Duty to use Linux, due to their kernel level anti-cheat, that should, frankly, be <em>illegal</em>. But Second Life is <em>essential</em>, and I refuse to reinstall Windows for <strong>one damn program or game</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="secondlife" /><category term="firestorm" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re like me, and you abandoned Windows quite a while ago, or maybe even recently, and you use the Firestorm viewer for Second Life (yes, this is probably an extreme niche of a niche of people), you’ve likely noticed that the latest update to the Firestorm flatpak has destroyed Firestorm.

And the same is true for the social media app that calls itself “decentralized” while not being decentralized whatsoever.</p>

<p>Giving users keys they can host on a VPS that open up a connection to your server farm is not what decentralization is.</p>

<p>But anyway …</p>

<p>Over the past week, Bluesky has managed to utterly destroy user trust in a period of time that’s even faster than Mozilla’s destruction of trust. A week ago, people were praising Bluesky as a safe alternative to Twitter that won’t host or embolden neo nazis. Now, bsky has become a haven for Jesse Singal, a dangerous troll who has lawyers.</p>

<p>Lawyers who are apparently requesting private information of users from Bluesky, and are being obliged???</p>

<p>This is what we call a Guinness Book of World Records attempt at enshitification.</p>

<p>I tried to find the official stance on all this, though, but it seems sources directly <em>from</em> Bluesky devs / moderators have either been deleted, or hidden. So, a lot of this probably sounds like hearsay, and the only thing I can really show is <a href="https://hexbear.net/post/4100941" target="_blank">this post from hexbear</a>.</p>

<p>But, <em>if this is true even in the slightest</em>, you should leave Bluesky, immediately.</p>

<p>You should leave Bluesky, and just … find a decent Mastodon instance. Which isn’t hard. I’ve written so many little guides on how to determine if an instance is good or bad, and I really have to reiterate, that while ActivityPub has its issues, it definitely doesn’t have a problem with moderation (as long as you don’t join a lawless instance, and I have to repeat, do not do that). Largely, because moderation issues are in the hands of the users, entirely.</p>

<p>I own my own server, I host and run it myself, and I completely ban anything I want!</p>

<p>No waiting for a trust and safety team to tell me all the reasons why they can’t do anything. Just one click of a button, and the shit’s gone, bro.</p>

<p>Now, I know not everyone in the world reads this blog, so these things I keep saying for sure aren’t reaching masses of people. But I post these things so that maybe they’ll be found in the future when people are looking for answers, or alternatives.</p>

<p>And I realize that some may return to Twitter, some may jump over to Threads, or <em>return</em> to Threads, and ActivityPub <em>may</em> experience another influx.</p>

That the team behind the app sort of leaves it <em>mostly</em> in the hands of the users to construct block and mute lists (which comes with accountability issues all on its own). But, one would only have to take a gander at the <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=jesse+singal" target="_blank">current Bluesky search results for Jesse Singal’s account</a> on the app, to see where some of this frustration might be coming from.</p>

<p>So, in response, I offer the alternative of Mastodon / ActivityPub again! Despite the random negative-posting I’ve seen on Bluesky <em>about</em> Mastodon (people don’t like aspects of the UI and join process), I really think people should check it out. Do some research. Find a community that <em>has</em> rules and guidelines. If you do this, I think you’ll be just fine.</p>

<p>Do you know how much bigotry and toxicity I see on my own instance?</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because I ban every single thing that even so much as slightly annoys me (ban, as in suspending from federation, i.e., making them invisible to my entire server).</p>

<p>If you’d like to give it a try, I have open registration on my instance at <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a>, and while I can’t sustain thousands of people, I can at least take in <em>some</em>. For MKMO, you only need provide a clear reason why you want to join (this is to weed out trolls), and give me some time to approve your account.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there are <em>plenty</em> other instances to look at, too. I suggest giving my page on <a class="page-link" href="/pages/activitypub">ActivityPub</a> a look, and then also the <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net" target="_blank">Join the Fediverse</a> website.</p>

<p>That’s all for now! I have to get ready for work soon, but I wanted to put this out there for those who may be interested in a <em>real</em> alternative to corporate-controlled, poorly moderated social media.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m seeing murmurs that people, at least some people, are becoming fed up with the low amount to entire lack of moderation on Bluesky.
