Part of that is because my day job highly makes me feel like I don’t want to do <em>anything</em> when I get out of work. The other part of it, is that I spent hours and hours refreshing and updating the look and feel of my site (it’s cooler now). Now that I’ve done that, I’d like to write about Vivaldi.</p>

<p>A little while ago I wrote about the <a href="/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai">on-going blunders of the Mozilla Foundation</a>, and their head-long dive into AI, and the manipulation of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-search-update/" target="_blank">hiding data hijacking</a> within features that promise privacy. Basically, Mozilla needs money, and they’re selling their souls in order to get it.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and you <em>just want a good browser</em> that doesn’t have a ton of bloat, that isn’t taking my private data and selling it to some corporation, or what-have-you, then you already know what you need.</p>

<p><em>A better browser.</em></p>

<p>Firefox has been my go-to for a <em>long</em> time. It’s a decent browser! But, if I decide I want to actually interact with AI, I <em>don’t need it embedded in frikken’ Firefox</em>. And I don’t think this is where their resources, their time, and their effort should be going.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve switched to Vivaldi. A browser I <em>think</em> I’ve heard of before, but never really used? Never-the-less, I was pretty surprised when I finally did. I mean, right off the bat, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/" target="_blank">they’ve pledged</a> <em>not</em> to dedicate resources to integrate AI into their browser. Which, for all intents and purposes, that’s all you gotta say!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such, it does not feel right to bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a very hard-no on AI generated “art.” Ripping people off in order to funnel money into people’s pockets, who’ve done nothing but write a sentence, is the epitome of evil and greed. Using regular AI to generate text, or books, or anything of the sort, is definitely the <em>same kind</em> of plagiarist evil. But, I <em>will</em> acknowledge that there can be <em>some</em> uses in regard to AI chat bots … even though the power consumption is just as bad, or <em>worse</em> than the blockchain and NFTs. So, I find it <em>really</em> hard to justify using them. I <em>have</em>, though. I’ve asked an AI for some ideas on writing prompts to get my juices flowing. I’ve used an AI over my phone at work to help customers when I don’t know the answer to, “What kind of battery do I need for a Ford Pinto 1992, 4 cylinder, special edition, Pro Max?” And it has helped.</p>

<p>I will admit, and be transparent, in that I have personally found <em>some</em> use in these things. But I also ask myself, “Could I have just found this information on a search engine that isn’t mired by crud? Could I have done it without using a machine that’s on its way to being hooked up to a nuclear reactor twenty miles away from me?”</p>

<p>But, all of that’s beside my point in this article, in that, Vivaldi <em>isn’t</em> going to put this stuff into their browser. And they’re not <em>ignoring</em> their userbase in order to do whatever they want, for profit, and for violation of privacy. And that’s a big breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>And <em>all of this</em> is completely aside from the absolutely <em>cool as hell</em> features Vivaldi has built-in.</p>

<p>The browser … AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKS ADS! You don’t need an extension! IT WORKS ON YOUTUBE. You can just view websites, ad-free, by … opening your web browser? Holy crap.</p>

<p>Of course, you have customization options, sync options, theme options, password and bookmark import and saving, and so on and so forth. But what I’ve found <em>really</em> useful, is the right-side bar that you can <em>connect to your Apple calendar</em>, and the RSS feed aggregator that you can just plug some RSS into, and see updates from all the blogs your read, live, right there on the side of your browser. There’s a translate button, a note button, a reminders button, a button that opens their personal Vivaldi Mastodon instance, and <em>so much more</em>.</p>

<p>It’s the end-all, be-all of browsers, and I cannot believe that this isn’t some super famous, extremely well-known browser and company that’s taking the entire world by storm … <strong><em>Because they should be.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to write about how impressed I am with the Vivaldi browser. I can’t say I’m too sure what’s going on with the Social Web Foundation, but what that entails for sure remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I think you should <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">give it a go</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a couple of days since I’ve written anything.

<p><a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">Drop on by the store</a> within Second Life and check them out! Or, if you’re busy, in a jam, or generally unable to be in Second Life right this moment, you can see them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-OS95-Edition/26431919" target="_blank">marketplace page</a>.</p>

<p>You might notice that the store location has changed <em>again</em>, but let me explain. The current location is a backup that I’ve had for a little over a month, in the event that I would have to move from the location that was provided to me. It turns out, I unfortunately have to do that. I attribute no fault to Logan, and I extend my deepest gratitude for being allowed to use the land he had in order to host my store. It’s not every day you meet someone in Second Life who’s willing to offer a helping hand.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this won’t really affect the store, because it’ll now just be at my fully Backrooms/Pool Rooms themed location. And although the size may be deceiving, I actually have plenty of <em>space</em> to work with.</p>

<p>And to all of the frequent shoppers, and those who have continued to shop from, and visit [REVOSA] for nearly ten years going, <em>thank you</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, following the end of the month-long shopping event at the Progeny Mall, the Nano Nexus (OS95 Edition) shorts are now available at the store!

To say that I’m a bit pissed off is an understatement.</p>

<p>So, let’s get straight to the vomit from the horse’s mouth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content in the grand scheme of this,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, which coincides with Meta’s annual Connect event. “My guess is that there are going to be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable.” But if creators are concerned or object, “when push comes to shove, if they demanded that we don’t use their content, then we just wouldn’t use their content. It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this point forward, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a> will be suspending any and all interaction with Threads.net. I won’t tell others what to do, but I’ve been teetering on this decision for a while. There are cool and decent people on Threads, but it’s just not worth it.</p>

<p>A billionaire thinks all of your thoughts, your memories, your written and graphical work and design … <em>isn’t worth shit.</em></p>

<p>But, it must be worth a hell of a lot if you’re feeding it into your sludge machine so that you can generate some glossy garbage that sucks ass, am I wrong?</p>

<p>Either way, I’m going to do what I should’ve done months ago, and I’m gonna Zuck the Zuck.</p>

<p>Go to hell, Meta.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.” Are the words of a man giving every writer, developer, creator, and artist a big, bold middle finger.</p>

<p>Those are all the words I have to give right now, and it’s exactly the right amount.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I, regrettably, have to talk about this by quoting from The Verge, but a couple of hours ago they published a talk with the Zuck on Meta’s AI, and the training data associated with it.

Basically, this group of companies and corporations who are banding together to throw their hats together as a supporting web to build up ActivityPub and the Fediverse. Except … It reads and feels a lot like, “We made this.”</p>

<p>As some may know, I’ve written about Mastodon, all of its diverse software, ActivityPub, and the Fediverse <em>quite</em> frequently. I even wrote a <a class="page-link" href="/pages/activitypub">little bit of a beginner’s guide</a> to jumping in, which also features some <em>history</em>. History that is entirely missing from TSWF.</p>

<p>My first question to all of this would be: Who <em>exactly</em> asked for this? The Fediverse, as mentioned in my guide, has existed since 2008, <em>without</em> corporate or moneyed influence.</p>

<p>Quoted from their mission page,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fediverse cannot thrive without people building clients or running providers. And to do those things, they need money. Whether that’s advertising supported, or funded by charities and non-profits, or based on paid-for services, or affiliate revenue, we are working to find ways that companies can do well in the Fediverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a majority of the people who populate the Fedi, we don’t <em>care</em> if companies are doing well across the protocol. It wasn’t <em>built for them.</em> And it should remain that way.</p>

<p>Yes, I run my own instance. No, I don’t make <em>any</em> money from it. And if I ever <em>did</em>, it would be entirely up to future potential users who want to support mkultra.monster. But, until then, it’s run entirely out-of-pocket, and <em>I’m okay with that</em>. I chose to do this, and I’m running a hosted service that caps out at a certain amount of users. And I’m also okay with that! I have no interest in running a social media platform that’s populated by one hundred million people.</p>

<p>Now, there are a lot of companies and non-profits coming together on this page, companies, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flipboard</li>
  <li>Automattic</li>
  <li>Meta</li>
  <li>Ghost</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>IFTAS</li>
  <li>Write.as</li>
  <li>Fastly</li>
  <li>Vivaldi</li>
  <li>The BLVD</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it kinda makes sense that writing platforms want to get in on ActivityPub and the Fediverse. But I feel a little uneasy about Automattic getting <em>too</em> involved. Their CEO is a <em>major</em> douche-nozzle, who once had a meltdown over a joke on Tumblr, and just recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/wp-engine-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-automattic-over-mullenwegs-comments/?guccounter=1" target="_blank">slandered a Wordpress provider</a> <em>for no reason</em>.</p>

<p>Vivaldi makes more sense to me, even though they’re a web browser provider. But, their words on the matter are actually aligned with what many people across the Fediverse believe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Fediverse reminds us of the early days of the Web. We are competing against silos and corporate interests, using a W3C-based open standard and a distributed solution,” says Jon Von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi (<a href="https://social.vivaldi.net/@jon" target="_blank">@jon@vivaldi.net</a>). “It’s great that social networking companies are supporting the Fediverse, and Vivaldi is pleased to support the Social Web Foundation so that we can once again have a town square free of algorithms and corporate control.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes <em>absolutely no sense</em> when you put these words and these developers <em>right next</em> to Meta, and Threads.</p>

<p>I’ve spoken <em>a lot</em> about Threads. I feel like, if you’re an instance provider on the Fedi, it’s entirely up to you whether you want to federate with them or not. But let’s not forget, Meta is a corporation. One of the <em>richest</em> corporations in the world, who definitely have <em>corporate</em> interests when it comes to social media, the web, and <em>ActivityPub</em>.</p>

<p>On top of that, it has been almost an entire <em>year</em>, and they still have not fully integrated federation on Threads. As it stands right now, likes and comments coming from the Fediverse show up as additional links you have to click multiple times in order to see, <em>while on Threads</em>. It’s a very tacked-on, a very, “These people aren’t Threads users, but here they are if you <em>really</em> want to see them” kind of gesture. Right now, its mostly superficial, and it rubs me the wrong way. It makes me feel like they <em>don’t</em> have any intention of <em>true</em> integration.</p>

<p>Not mentioned, but included in the list, are Mastodon and Pixelfed. These are, <em>at least</em>, entities that have been involved for a long time, and are partially responsible for the Fediverse becoming just a little bit more mainstream than it was before.</p>

<p>But where’s the mention of Akkoma, Pleroma, GNU Social, Freindika, Misskey, <strong><em>Peertube</em></strong>, and so on, and so forth? Are we just going to ignore them into the ether?</p>

<p>The Fediverse is home to something like … 15 million people or so (not that much more than Bluesky, and with this news, bsky devs are probably sharting themselves)? And it’s only growing as users on Threads turn on federation. But if companies and corporations can’t see themselves as part of the Fediverse without injecting money, sponsors, and ads into it, <em>then they should get out, and stay out.</em> The internet is <em>overrun</em> with sludge-content designed to waste your time and steal your attention for someone else’s financial gain. Rebuilding the open web is completely and entirely about escaping all of that, <em>for good</em>. It’s about bringing back the days of <em>people</em>, building their own spaces, having their own ideas and conversations free of algorithms and corporate influence.</p>

<p>To want to interfere in that, and possibly even <em>destroy</em> it, well. Maybe I <em>should</em> full-block Threads, and other corporate entrances into the Fediverse via my instance.</p>

<p>I really don’t know right now.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, kind of just completely out-of-the-blue, this thing called “The Social Web Foundation” launched.

It’s <em>basically</em> almost all I know. You know, aside from those times I launched a GNU Social instance, and then a very short-lived Pleroma instance. GNU Social is a lot like if someone made an open source Facebook, and Pleroma is okay, but it was originally made by <em>a terrible person</em> (not that this should stop you from doing whatever you want, with your time, and servers).</p>

<p>Then there was Misskey. Something I never really explored all that much, because the flagship instance, based in Japan, <em>outright</em> bans western users from even so much as <em>registering</em> on the instance. I tried to look up reasons as to why this is so, and all I could really find were reactionary Americans saying, “It’s because woke bad, and Japan don’t not no like that, bro?”</p>

<p>But, like other pieces of fediverse/activitypub software, Misskey’s got some forks. A lot of forks.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/sharkey/matrix-gun.gif" alt="an animated gif from the scene in The Matrix where Neo and Trinity are in a blank white room, and infinite racks of guns race up to them." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure <em>why</em> this is, but that’s the beauty of open source software. You can jack a piece of it for yourself, and then completely rework it to fit your wants and needs.</p>

<p>Enter: <a href="https://activitypub.software/TransFem-org/Sharkey#findaninstance" target="_blank">Sharkey</a>.</p>

<p>I was trying to find a comprehensive reason as to <em>why</em> Misskey was forked, and then transformed into Sharkey, but mostly all I could really find was this general statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharkey is a Misskey fork following upstream changes when possible, with added features. Like any other ActivityPub software Sharkey can interface with the thousands of servers that form the fediverse, an interconnected social network, working in tandem with software such as Akkoma, Mastodon, Pixelfed and many more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is fine! I’ll also note that Sharkey seems to be centered around trans-feminine users and themes, which is also cool.</p>

<p>The fediverse, at least on the Mastodon side, kind of has this reputation that it’s full of, and <em>made for</em> tech geek dude type people. Which, I’ve detailed before, was really only the case back in like, 2016. I’d say <em>now</em>, as in 2024, the fediverse overall is very populated by the LGBTQ+ community, and all sorts of people and walks-of-life, in-general.</p>

<p>But what’s it like?</p>

<p>Oh, it’s cool. It’s <em>pretty</em> cool.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/sharkey/sharkey.png" alt="A screenshot of my feed on a Sharkey instance, showcasing all the columns and many buttons and options you can utilize." />
</center>
<p><i>Names in the notification tab blurred in order to preserve privacy.</i>
<br /></p>

<p>Right away, you can see that this is a hell of a lot not like Mastodon <em>at all</em>. You’ve got the ability to post, of course, but you have <em>full control</em> over the UI, everything can be customized, trending topics update <em>live</em>, all of your files are able to be seen in an account-based “drive,” and did I mention you could have all the links you want on your profile page?</p>

<p>And, I feel like one of the main draws of Misskey and its forks, are the many, <em>many</em> emoji reactions you can use on posts that readily replace the tired old fave button.</p>

<p>So, basically, it’s kind of like Mastodon, but it’s more fun, and heavily customizable.</p>

<p>In fact, I feel Misskey is really aiming for self expression, and appealing to creative types.</p>

<p>My dilemma, is that I like this <em>so much</em> that I kind of want to use it more than my <em>own</em> instance, and I’ve even considered halting payments on a Mastodon server, and just migrating everything I do to the Sharkey instance I’m on, because … why not!?</p>

<p>But, at the same time, my Mastodon instance has a really sweet domain (the same one this website uses), and I’ve been using it for about a year now. I just don’t know for sure if I want to abandon that. Even if I decided to move the domain to my own hosted Sharkey instance, I’d still <em>lose</em> some data in that process. Not my posts though. Every <em>single thing</em> I’ve ever posted on my instance is copied and backed-up in a Google drive document.</p>

<p>Whatever I end up choosing to do with my time and my posting, you should check out Sharkey for yourself! Here are some instances to check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blahaj.zone" target="_blank">blahaj.zone</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://transfem.social" target="_blank">transfem.social</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://mk.absturztau.be" target="_blank">mk.absturztau.be</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://kitsunes.club" target="_blank">kitsunes.club</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can check out more instances, <a href="https://fedidb.org/software/sharkey" target="_blank">here</a>, but I <em>highly</em> recommend investigating them before face-planting your keyboard and hitting that join button. Like with all fediverse software, it’s all run by regular people. And some regular people are … <em>not using fediverse software for good things</em> (I don’t want to be the reason you accidentally join a server for Nazis that everyone, their Mom, and admin have blocked, suspended, and silenced).</p>

<p>Otherwise, thanks for reading!

GNU Social is a lot like if someone made an open source Facebook, and Pleroma is okay, but it was originally made by a terrible person (not that this should stop you from doing whatever you want, with your time, and servers).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Scrobbling is My New Favorite Hobby</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/21/scrobbling-is-my-new-favorite-hobby.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Scrobbling is My New Favorite Hobby" /><published>2024-09-21T11:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-21T11:42:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/21/scrobbling-is-my-new-favorite-hobby</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tech/2024/09/21/scrobbling-is-my-new-favorite-hobby.html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2012, and I don’t even remember how I went about it, I spent enormous amounts of time scrobbling my music listening habits to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>. This lasted into 2014, and I am at least <em>semi</em> certain I started using Spotify for this. How I did before that time … I think I must’ve been using Winamp to track things I was listening to.</p>

<p>Yes. That’s it.</p>

<p>Then I eventually created a new account for my musical presence under <em>Eyeshadow 2600 FM</em> and scrobbled into the 30,000s, and, like with my original account, eventually stopped doing this, as well. I also don’t really have any interest in reviving the ES2600FM Last.fm account, but that’s more to do with the piss-poor online synthwave community than anything (bullying, harassment, stalking, black-listing, etc).</p>

<p>Now we’ll snap into 2024, like a time machine, and I’m back at it again scrobbling on Last.fm, because it’s <em>much</em> simpler to do now. But, I’m mostly doing this because I found this little open source project that’s <em>like</em> Last.fm, but more like an entire open-web social media network of your listening habits, a Wiki that documents <em>every song ever</em>, and even an app you can use on your PC to submit meta-data to their database.</p>

<p>It’s honestly pretty wild, and I only discovered it because of a side-account I made via the Fediverse on <a href="https://kitsunes.club/@foxx_nova" target="_blank">kitsunes.club</a>. Have I mentioned that Sharkey (a misskey fork) is really cool, and I’m <em>half</em> considering using it as a primary and dropping the costs of hosting my own instance (I’m still not sure about this, though, because I <em>have</em> to have some kind of account on a Mastodon server, if only to at least have a place to link my posts here so that I can have comments)?</p>

<p>But anyway, the database is at <a href="https://musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a>, and once you’ve made an account there, you can head over to <a href="https://listenbrainz.org" target="_blank">ListenBrainz</a>, and then connect all of your music-listening apps. By doing this, you can scrobble to Last.fm, <em>and</em> directly to ListenBrainz, where your tastes, history, listening trends and habits all become part of this little … social network of <em>everyone’s</em> listening habits. It’s, again, really <em>cool</em>.</p>

<p>If you’ve gotten past all of that, and you <em>still</em> want more, and <em>also</em> have a digital music collection just sitting on your PC collecting dust, you can then grab <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">Picard</a>, and catalogue your collection from your hard drive directly to MusicBrainz.</p>

<p>The best part about all of this, is that it can be <em>mostly</em> entirely automatic, requiring little input from the user, depending on <em>what</em> you use for music.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend anyone who regularly listens to music to give all of this a try, and also <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/user/foxx_nova" target="_blank">follow me</a> on ListenBrainz! Let’s compare our musical taste!</p>

<p>Anything that makes it feel like it’s still 2000 to 2010 internet is a-okay in my book.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2012, and I don’t even remember how I went about it, I spent enormous amounts of time scrobbling my music listening habits to Last.fm.

To top it off, they’ve done this <em>before</em> altering their terms of service. So, technically, nobody’s agreed to this. But! We all know the people behind large learning models <em>absolutely</em> do not know what consent is.</p>

<p>Real quick, how to turn it off:</p>

<p>Click “Me” at the top, then go to “Settings and Privacy,” then click the “Data Privacy” tab. I want to note how <em>hilarious</em> it is to have a tab called “Data Privacy” where they’re automatically taking all of your data to sell to the highest bidder, and to feed into Microsoft’s plagiarism machines. But anyway … then click, “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and then toggle that off.</p>

<p>Problem solved!</p>

<p>But, honestly? <em>Who the heck</em> uses LinkedIn? The last time I seriously attempted to use the site as a social network, I felt like I should’ve been compensated for my time, you know, <em>paid</em>. I felt like I should’ve gone to work the next day and filled out a time adjustment just for logging into the Founder Zone.</p>

<p>Surely there’s a better way to go about advertising what you can do and who you are to the world, where your thoughts can stream independently and <em>not</em> be Zucked up by some kind of machine that’s melting the ice caps, right?</p>

<p>Everything you can do on LinkedIn, you can accomplish by building a portfolio, having a resume, and posting on normal social media regularly by sometimes showcasing your skills, and asking about job opportunities. This happens on the fediverse <em>all of the time</em>. <strong><em>Yes, I am once again suggesting you <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers" target="_blank">Join Mastodon</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>You don’t need a social network where everyone is talking in customer service voice and never allowing their minds a break from work-life.</p>

<p>And, I mean, for sure, it goes without saying …</p>

<p>Microsoft’s version of AI is pretty inescapable, despite measures I’ve taken by … using Linux on my main machine, having an iPhone (which will now have an opt-in AI feature), and shelving my Xbox. But, this website is also fed through Github in order to be built, and deployed, and I <em>do</em> still keep some old files on Microsoft’s cloud drive.</p>

<p>Whichever way you look at it, you’ve <em>already</em> been scraped by billionaires who should have paid you for your time, energy, and data. And, maybe someday they’ll be <em>forced to</em>.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean you should subject yourself to LinkedIn, and allow Microsoft to take <em>even more</em> of your data. In the open web, I call that <em>self harm</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t heard by now, LinkedIn suddenly implemented a “feature” into their social network that automatically opts you into allowing them to use all of your data for AI training.

And thousands upon <em>thousands</em> of people <em>did</em>. It’s one of the largest gatherings of anti-AI force I’ve seen <em>so far</em>, and it was glorious.</p>

<p>Contrary to all of that, Mozilla is pulling the new and quite popular corporate response to backlash, and <em>completely ignoring everything.</em> Which brings us to today’s post on Mozilla making the move to shut down their Mastodon instance, <em>completely</em>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/posts/mozilla2/shutting_down.png" alt="Screenshot of a post from the official Mozilla account on the fediverse, speaking about how they're regretfully shutting down their Mastodon instance, with no real reason given." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I screenshotted this so that it can’t be erased by Mozilla themselves, but do you see that? Do you see the <em>entire lack</em> of a verifiable reason as to why they’ve made this decision? Just a “Welp, goodbye. Everyone pack your bags and get out of here.”</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Gee, I wonder if it’s because … logging on to see thousands of people telling you that your company is making the wrong move, making <em>bad</em> decisions, and tossing user data and privacy concerns out the window, is just too much to handle? I don’t know. Maybe paying for AI data farms that slowly melt away the ice caps is more important to you than the 40 bucks it costs to pay a managed host to keep your instance online.</p>

<p>That couldn’t possibly be it, could it, Mozilla?</p>

<p>But, here’s the thing: If you, as a company, have made a decision, and you can’t even back up that decision in the face of people who might not like it, and said company opts to <em>cut off discourse completely</em>, instead, that says just one thing: Mozilla is ashamed of what they’ve done, and are doing, and <em>they know</em> it is indefensible.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just recently, I wrote about Mozilla proposing their new “AI” features in their nightly builds, and was sharing around the post they made, via another user on the fediverse, calling for all Firefox-enjoyers to run on over and tell them to stop.

I’ve spent a lot of blog posts giving my own opinion on current events, or unfortunate advancements in tech that facilitate mass theft, or rolling my face on the keyboard in my Backrooms obsession. I suppose maybe sometimes it’s harder to write about myself, and what and how I’m feeling about things, because I find it hard to actually <em>want</em> people to know me.</p>

<p>It’s been over a decade and a half since I really started … “making things.” It’s been even longer since I dipped my toes into web development, and suddenly arrived at this point. It’s been just about as long that I’ve been working jobs that put money toward bills, and … I find myself wanting <em>more</em>.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, I just wanted to be a web developer. And, in a way, or sense, <em>I am</em>. But it’s not my <em>career</em>.</p>

<p>It should be. I basically <em>grew up</em> with a keyboard in my hands. <em>Why is this not my source of income?</em></p>

<p>Instead, I throw myself around in manual labor jobs and tell people what to do, and I pray every second for my weekend, or my time away from work. Time away, so I can do <em>what I really want to do</em>.</p>

<p>And it’s come to this point where, I look back at the time I spent in my early thirties where I kind of … <em>was</em> doing what I wanted to do. It just wasn’t making me any livable money. I wonder sometimes if I just didn’t try hard enough, or if I was <em>almost there</em>. I had a semi-popular album, and then catastrophe happened. I continue to write fiction, but at this point it’s mostly just a hobby. I run a store in Second Life, but it mainly only just <em>barely</em> pays for the Second Life subscription itself (even though, bringing in sales enough to do that for almost ten years within the virtual world is actually pretty impressive).</p>

<p>I look back at that, and wish I could try again, or <em>do it again</em>, but <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>I think I’ve realized this part of myself will <em>never be happy</em> until I am doing the concept of <em>this</em>, again, and <em>also</em> making a livable wage from it. For the longest time I thought I was at the end, or I thought I was as good as dead, and then everything changed and I made a whole lot of progress in life … only to wish I could go back.</p>

<p>I’m not burned out on making music, or building websites, or writing fiction, or anything else, besides … regular life. I hate the normalcy, and my brain pushes back against it every second of the day. And I’m living <em>two lives</em> because of it. The person I am at work? Basically a visage that doesn’t really exist. A fake me that puts on this face that <em>only</em> exists for eight hours, five days a week. I’m <em>so</em> cut off between these two worlds that I just about completely refuse to interact with anyone I know within the building, <em>outside of it</em>.</p>

<p>But I’m rambling about these nonstop streams of thought, and I just wanted to express, mostly? That something needs to change. It’s been a while. And maybe I’ve found <em>some</em> change in this little virtual reality space, VR Chat. But I need a bigger change. Whether that’s a web development career, or a solid, <em>actual</em> relationship, that doesn’t die out in months.</p>

<p>Heck, I dunno what it’s gonna be, but I know it’s coming.</p>

<p>Maybe I should write a resume for once?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a little while since I’ve written anything relating personally, to myself.

A fixation on a new kind of horror that is both hugely popular, and completely under-the-radar. Something I’ve written about numerous times now, including fictional speculation, and my most recent play-through of the Backrooms inspired Steam game, POOLS: Many have their ideas about the Complex, many people put out amateur content that is in the very least, <em>entertaining.</em> And then Kane Pixels, every so often, drops a nuclear horror bomb that redefines the Backrooms, <em>again</em>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acdYs9tPLko?si=Z869MvwMRWxLPcon" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>But it’s not <em>just</em> the Backrooms, or the <em>idea</em> of it that makes it scary. It’s the liminal born horror of being in places where nothing lives. You walk through your house, you probably have hallways, and stairs. You don’t <em>live</em> in these spaces, but they exist, nonetheless. In the silence of the day or the night, you stand in these spaces, maybe at 2am, and you feel like it’s wrong. Maybe you don’t, maybe you do. You jump in your car at 3am and drive out on a lonely highway, and you stop at a seemingly empty gas station. Again, it probably feels … <em>off</em>.</p>

<p>That’s the liminality we’re talking here.</p>

<p>The Backrooms are the hallways in an empty home, the gas station late at night, the middle of nowhere on an empty road, <em>forever</em>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/img/posts/kanebackrooms/gasstation.png" />
</center>
<p><br />
It’s a concept I first learned and heard of, funnily enough, on <em>Tumblr</em>, years ago, and this is exactly the way it was described. Except it wasn’t horror, and there were no Backrooms (that came a bit later, via a single 4chan post).</p>

<p>A lot of random content on Youtube are cartoonish demons, and disembodied smiley faces, and then you stumble upon what I believe to be the <em>real</em> Backrooms. Everything ever made by Kane Pixels. The “howler,” the “bacteria”, and now, in FF3, whatever the <em>hell</em> that was. I think it’s speculated our new monster is a bacteria infected human, driven mad. But, unlike the other two “found footage” pieces in the evolving story that Kane’s been crafting, number three feels … too real. The distinction between the real world in the recording and 3D rendering, is completely unclear. It’s totally seamless. For a while, it seems as though <em>all of it</em> is a set piece that someone is <em>actually</em> walking through. And, for all intents and purposes, it very well could have been.</p>

<p>And then our camera-wielding buddy enters a lone home surrounded by walls, and … <em>speaks</em> to someone connected in reality. Something <em>not ever done</em> in Backrooms fiction before. And not only that, the protagonist “witnesses” the man he’s speaking to, falling directly into the same place, but somewhere else. And then you get an exposition from the cameraman as he takes in his last moments, right before the battery dies.</p>

<p>If this is <em>anything</em> like the movie, Hollywood won’t know what hit ‘em.</p>

<p>Some people call it boring walking simulation, or not even scary, and those people would be wrong. We’ve had Resident Evil, we’ve had Scream, and we’ve had The Ring. I think it’s time for the next evolution of horror. I don’t know why I say “I think it’s time,” I mean, it’s <em>already here</em>.</p>

<p>Just watch it. Most of it is unnerving, most of it is freaky and unsettling. But this newest offering goes even <em>deeper</em>. And I definitely mean that as a pun.</p>

<p>I find myself sometimes wondering what it would be like to suddenly break from the meandering regularity of my real life and “fall” directly into an endless labyrinth. I mean … aside from starving to death. Everyone in these found footage videos have what appears to be amazing courage. But I don’t think I could <em>ever</em>. I might sulk in a corner and wait, or just run and run and run until something hears me. Who knows! I don’t do well with empty and strange places where things could be following you in the dark.</p>

<p>But that’s my take on Kane Pixels’ Backrooms content, and the ridiculously good third found footage sequence.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Media" /><category term="media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the better part of a year, I’ve been absolutely raving about the Backrooms.
