<p>Have you ever thought to yourself, “Man, why do I have to copy/paste blog post links and then also post them? I have more important things to do, like jorkin it in the club, you know, with my peanuts.”</p>

<p>Well, friend, you are in luck today.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/blog-poster" target="_blank">Blog-Poster</a>. He’ll dig into your RSS feed, post whatever’s new straight to Mastodon, and then archive it in a permanent ignore list, just so he’s sure never to mistake something that’s old, for something new.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Of course, you can give him a new name, like “Barry” or “Fart Face.” It doesn’t matter to me!</p>

<p>I still have lots to learn, and I’m starting to retain more and more as I do this, but I realize that programming is a very large and long road. Heck. I’ve been screwing with HTML since about 1999, and I still have to keep Google open to reference CSS modules and what-not. Plus, I’m getting older, and stuff just slips out of my brain juice and then it’s gone with the wind.</p>

<p>Either way, that’s all I have to write about for now, cause tomorrow’s my day off from my offline job, and I’m about to chill, and do nothing. Or make a 4th bot. I dunno yet.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the dunces in the room are using AI to paint pictures for them, and make one-bar songs, I’m making little worker bee-bots that aren’t AI at all, but act more like little tiny butlers for me.

<p>You heard me.</p>

<p>When there is no more room in hell, the anime boobs will walk the Mastodon.</p>

<p>Obviously, there is some room for failure here. Failure, in that, sometimes people post AI-generated sludge to Reddit, and that <em>may</em> get caught in the bot. If it happens too often, I’ll either figure out how to exclude that stuff, or just not include that specific subreddit in the bot’s pull.</p>

<p>This is sort of still ongoing, too. I tried a bunch of different tricks to get the bot to stop posting the preview, tiny, pixelated image, but to no avail. Or, maybe to vail. It <em>may</em> be just my instance that isn’t uploading them correctly, but I’m not sure yet.</p>

<p>If you want to see the bot directly, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/@net_run" target="_blank">it’s here</a>. Warning, though, some of the posts it grabs are NSFW and entirely lewd. You have been warned.</p>

<p>This is pretty cool, though, because, the last time I did <em>anything</em> like this, it was a <strong>chatbot</strong> that I integrated with a <a href="https://gnusocial.network" target="_blank">GNU Social</a> (still around today) instance I was running, way, way back in … 2017, I think?</p>

<p>Kinda brings back memories, even if that instance is completely lost to time, and only viewable in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180314155440/http://sanguine.merylscarlett.info/" target="_blank">fragments of an Apache default page</a> on archive.org.</p>

<p>As for Python, so far it feels like writing CSS, but with a lot more statements, and also things that can go wrong!</p>

<p>But anyway, it’s time for my nightly iPad and Youtube ritual.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because my Mastodon timeline isn’t spicy and chaotic enough, I scraped together pieces of things I’m trying to learn and utilize in Python, and put together a whole entire bot that posts images from a Reddit RSS feed, directly to Mastodon.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Jump on the Bandwagon!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/social%20media/2024/10/05/jump-on-the-bandwagon.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jump on the Bandwagon!" /><published>2024-10-05T21:49:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-05T21:49:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/social%20media/2024/10/05/jump-on-the-bandwagon</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/social%20media/2024/10/05/jump-on-the-bandwagon.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m sure there are those who know that Bandcamp was recently bought out by a company called <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2023/11/22/songtradr-acquires-bandcamp/" target="_blank">Songtradr</a>, and this came with much dismay, because Bandcamp has been, and has mostly remained, <em>one of the only</em> music platforms where small artists could actually be discovered, heard, and <em>paid</em>. This is incongruent with current trends of the past decade and a half, of the music industry pushing real hard for streaming. Streaming, which pays fractions of a penny of a penny on a dollar, while the rich consume the profits. This has only been exasperated since AI came into the scene, with people absent of talent and inspiration, generating <em>absolute garbage</em> (and this isn’t just a problem in music, it’s everywhere).</p>

<p>I personally haven’t seen, heard, or noticed any detrimental effects of Bandcamp being bought-out, but it’s good to be prepared. To be prepared in an age where Mozilla is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/advertising/" target="_blank">suddenly an ad agency</a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-copilot-recall-cybersecurity-disaster" target="_blank">developing spyware</a>, OpenAI is asking governments for enough <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank">electrical power</a> to destroy the entire planet, and Apple is <a href="https://applescoop.org/story/shocking-apple-vision-pro-2-reportedly-cancelled" target="_blank">releasing products</a> people <em>don’t want</em>.</p>

<p>We’re living in a universe that is slowly becoming a perpetual backwards day (not that Microsoft was ever a decent forward-thinking company, or that OpenAI ever had any good intentions with their grift of theft, but I digress…).</p>

<p>But there are those who read my musings, who know I’m a freak for the fediverse.</p>

<p>You might guess where this is going.</p>

<p>“Wait, are you about to tell me that there’s a motherfuggin’ Bandcamp, ON THE FEDIVERSE?”</p>

<p>Yes, yes I am about to tell you that, Fortnite Gamer.</p>

<p>This morning, while I was slogging away at getting ready for work, I saw a post flash past my Mastodon feed, something like, “It’s Bandcamp, but on the fediverse!”</p>

<p>I thought to myself, “Hmm, okay. I’ll bookmark this for 10 hours from now.”</p>
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="img-wrap">
<img src="/img/posts/bandwagon/tenhours.png" />
</div>
</div>
<p>So, I clicked the link and followed through to <a href="https://bandwagon.fm" target="_blank">Bandwagon.fm</a>, and, my dudes …</p>

<p>I now have a “bandcamp” on the fediverse, <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/@cmdr_nova" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

<p>Save for the ability to actually <em>sell</em> your music (which I assume they’re working on?), you can upload whole entire albums here, and then people can stumble in and listen to what you’ve made! That’s WILD. … on the FEDIVERSE?!</p>

<p>What I did here with my page, though, is I took the 3 most recent albums I did under Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and re-published them under my new name, PLEXX. Once I <em>finally</em> finish <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX</a>, I’ll be putting that album there, too.</p>

<p>But this is <em>so cool</em>, and it’s connected to Musicbrainz, another open-source music cataloguing project!</p>

<p>Earlier today, I was having second thoughts about Linux, and sticking to open source and all that. Mostly because, I sort of miss a few programs that I’m having trouble getting working on Pop!_OS. But this kind of turned me around a bit. There’s <em>no</em> reason to go back to the bastardized version of whatever Bill Gates had in mind 30 years ago. This proves to me that regular people <em>will</em> restore the internet to what it should have always been.</p>

<p>The only thing it takes, is <em>patience</em>, and a whole lot less second-guessing myself and my decisions. And also maybe I need to sit in front of my computer screen a little less here and there. My eyes hurt.</p>

<p>Anyway, I <em>can’t wait</em> to see what the heck comes next, holy crap.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure there are those who know that Bandcamp was recently bought out by a company called Songtradr, and this came with much dismay, because Bandcamp has been, and has mostly remained, one of the only music platforms where small artists could actually be discovered, heard, and paid.

<p>Enter: the_daily_report</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/the_daily_report/tree/main" target="_blank">simple python script</a> that you need only make a personal Reddit app for, and then you’re done (mostly).</p>

<p>I’m still a bit of a noob, learning all of this stuff as I go, like you do, and <em>how I do</em>. So, I’m writing this with it scheduled to send me my daily report at 9am, everyday, and guess what, it works!</p>

<p>Voila:</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/thereport/the_report_example.png" /></p>

<p>I initially had to do a ton of troubleshooting, because my machine <em>doesn’t</em> just automatically send e-mails when I tell it to, and I’ve detailed as much of that as I could in a troubleshooting section via the repository. Hopefully it’s clear enough what needs to be done.</p>

<p>I have this issue where, I’ll use someone’s app, and then their help files make no sense, or are woefully incomplete. In writing my own, I now see why that may happen, because I’m basically just throwing in solutions I used and hoping they stick!</p>

<p>Now, <em>obviously</em>, this means you have to have your PC turned on at all times, unless of course you setup a server on a remote PC, such as renting a VPS over at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. I’ve <em>considered</em> this for myself, but I don’t know if sending myself a daily report of trending posts in subreddits is really something I should just dump money into. Mostly, because I <em>do</em> have my PC on at all times, in-between minutes every couple of days that I restart the thing.</p>

<p>But it’s an option!</p>

<p>Anyway, you can see the whole thing in the link above, and hopefully, if I’ve done my job correctly, you can get it running for yourself.</p>

<p>Note: I do not use Windows, and I cannot tell you how to make this work on a Microsoft machine!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re like me, and you just can’t find it in yourself to quit the nerd-site, then maybe you should make it easier on yourself, and setup something to just give you a daily report (e-mail) on your favorite subreddits’ top five trending posts.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Life Without a Computer?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writing%20prompt/2024/10/03/life-without-a-computer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life Without a Computer?" /><published>2024-10-03T22:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-03T22:15:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writing%20prompt/2024/10/03/life-without-a-computer</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writing%20prompt/2024/10/03/life-without-a-computer.html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been at least two months since I’ve done one of Jetpack’s writing prompts. Largely, because, I ditched Wordpress and decided to build something from scratch. It seems, in light of the Wordpress CEO’s recent blunders, it was <em>probably a good idea</em> to abandon Wordpress. But I really only did it because I enjoy writing everything in VS Code, rather than a glitchy editor. Nevertheless, I still have Automattic’s “jetpack” app installed on my phone, and it serves me interesting writing prompts every once in a while, and because I don’t enjoy writing about a crisis every single time I fire up the VSC, I think I’ll snag this one.</p>

<p>So, full-stop, I had access to a computer in about 1992, I believe. I think I spoke about this before, but it was something my Dad was provided by his job, and it <em>wasn’t</em> exactly up-to-date with current versions of Windows. It was more like a mid-80s machine with <em>extremely</em> early versions of DOS, and bulletin boards. The menu was built into a permanent console, like something you write through via Linux (for the zoomies who don’t know what the hell DOS is), and it was … pretty basic.</p>

<p>I think that thing is still sitting around, <em>somewhere</em> out there.</p>

<p>As time marched forward, we got another PC, and another PC, and then a Gateway 486, and then that was largely what I used, until I was given another “hand-me-down”-ish PC when I was around 15 or 16. About the time I discovered anime forums, and started e-dating as many girls as I could … with video chat over aol instant messenger, and … a whole lot of embarrassing things I probably shouldn’t have been sharing with girls I, ultimately, <em>didn’t really know</em>, at all.</p>

<p>Then, when I graduated, I was gifted <em>another PC</em>, which is when I <em>really</em> started gaming. And then years later I built one myself, and then I upgraded it, and then I bought another PC. And then I ditched that one, and bought one in 2018, and then I ditched that one, too, and bought the powerhouse Linux PC I’m currently using today (alongside the Windows Dell, and Macbook I have as side machines).</p>

<p>What would life be like, had none of this ever happened?</p>

<p>I guess I’d probably watch paint dry? Or, am I still allowed to have my iPhone? Cause, if that’s the case, I guess the only thing that’d be different is I’d probably be some kind of prolific mobile gamer, who never got into web development. Maybe I’d be streaming to Twitch via my phone as I bumble around Genshin Impact. Who knows!</p>

<p>But, let’s say the phone is also a computer.</p>

<p><em>This question is far too open-ended for the 2020s, don’t you think?</em></p>

<p>So, no PC, no laptops, no phone, no toasters with touch-screens, and we’ll just assume, in this version of the universe, my job <em>also</em> hasn’t given me a phone to work with.</p>

<p>Alright.</p>

<p>Since television is mainly on streaming now, and basic “appointment TV” doesn’t really exist anymore (and by that, I mean, episodic television that isn’t dumped all at once), I guess I’d probably have a Smart TV, and I’d probably spend <em>a lot</em> of my time watching shows. Maybe I’d also read a lot more. I don’t know if I’d be writing, because … I guess I’d have to do that by <em>hand</em>? Like a <strong><em>baby</em></strong>. But, that’s the thing, a smart TV is also a computer! We’ll, for the sake of this post, just pretend that it isn’t, though.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I’d have a richer social life, because I think factors that made it harder for me to connect with people in the 2020s, <em>aren’t</em> really related to having access to a PC, but more that people in-general are, or have, isolated themselves in their own little bubbles of media that they themselves dictate. Which, in-turn, makes casual conversation <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p>But … without access to all of the world’s knowledge and information, I guess I’d probably be a lot more uninformed. I’d probably be much more susceptible to just <em>believing</em> anything anyone tells me. I’d probably question things less. I wouldn’t have random college credits sitting on my name, and I guess I wouldn’t have a resume, either?</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>

<p>Uh, I think we’ll skip this universe.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty important to have access to technology, and the internet. Because, just sitting here thinking about what life would be like <em>without</em> all this stuff, sounds … horrifying. And, maybe that’s nerdy. But damn, dude, no. No I don’t think I’d want to live a life of watching TV and sleeping.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Writing Prompt" /><category term="writing-prompt" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been at least two months since I’ve done one of Jetpack’s writing prompts.

Drinking our Ecto-Coolers, slipping on Velcro sneakers, uh, watching Rocko’s Modern Life.</p>

<p>But sometimes I also wish it was still 2012. Still in the midst of the Mass Effect trilogy, the greatest game series <em>ever created</em>. Still logging onto a <em>mostly</em> normal Facebook to get my daily clicks in Mafia Wars and Farmville.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/2012/mafiwars.png" /></p>

<p>A time when Sims 3 was the latest and greatest of the franchise, and <em>all I was doing</em> in the game was walking my sim around collecting diamonds and rocks, and trying to figure out what kind of bathroom she should have. When I was still mystified by new experiences, and finding wonder in exploring new narratives. Back when the iPhone still had what I think were the best icon graphics, a headphone jack, and iPods! Yeah, I had an iPod Touch! …that I played digital poker with.</p>

<p>When I’d jump on Google cam-chats with friends, lay in bed, and just talk all night long, and when Youtube was just a place where people uploaded random weird stuff that wasn’t designed to pull you in and keep you there for ad-rolls and sponsored segments.</p>

<p>… when cigarettes only cost like, four dollars a pack.</p>

<p>A year wherein I’d get out of work and still have the energy to <em>do things that I enjoy</em>.</p>

<p>I miss 2012.</p>

<p>There’s no use living in the past, but there were <em>a lot</em> of great things about technology in the 90s, and 2000s, and even 2010. And then suddenly it all started going downhill. Things <em>advanced</em>, but for <em>no reason</em>. Oh boy, bigger cameras, larger screens, thinner bezels, s … streaming? I don’t <em>own</em> my music and movies anymore? All the casual games I liked using to pass time are on my phone? Sweet! … oh, almost <em>all of them</em> are copies of each other and filled with so much money-grubbing they could only really be classified as a game for the first 5 minutes that you interact with it?</p>

<p>Instagram is about posting engagement-bait and getting popular with short-form content until you can … get sponsored with product placement?</p>

<p>Twitter got murdered by Elon Musk and now it’s just nazis and ai-gen spam?</p>

<p>What the <em>heck</em>?</p>

<p><strong><em>I miss 2012.</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s not all bad. We got Mastodon, we got a federated network of users taking ownership of their content, and the indie web (a revival of the 90s internet). There are still <em>good</em> games out there, and a whole lot of indie developers who make some real gems. But, <em>man</em>, do you really have to sift through mountains and oceans of garbage to find content and entertainment <em>actually worth consuming</em>.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I’m just getting older, and everything is just <em>fine</em> the way it is.</p>

Partially because, <em>usually</em>, when I share what I write, <em>it doesn’t even show a headline</em>. But, you’re probably wondering, “What could Mastodon/the fediverse possibly have that MySpace doesn’t?”</p>

<p>Twitter has fabricated and AI generated misinformation, Threads has influencers in a battle royale to see who can steal the most posts written by normal people, Bluesky has all the bullies from social justice circles who never got anywhere with their quote-tweet dogpiling, and Mastodon has …</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Snarky and sarcastic remarks aside, this <em>isn’t</em> really isolated to Mastodon. It’s just that it’s <em>named</em> after Mastodon. But, like all things on the fediverse, it reaches most software connected to it. But that’s not what this post is about. We’re talking about something here that I’ve <em>never</em> really seen outside of Discord channels and chat-rooms.</p>

<p>A community-wide sort of event that happens every Sunday at 9pm eastern standard time.</p>

<p>A cheesy horror or monster movie is chosen, usually from anywhere between the forties, fifties, and sixties (and maybe sometimes the seventies and eighties), and then everyone who <em>wants to</em>, loads up the movie at the aforementioned time, and the fediverse turns into a waterfall of a huge amount of people posting to the #monsterdon hashtag their impressions and witticisms about whatever movie they all happen to be watching in that given week. Jesus, that was a hell of a run-on sentence.</p>

<p>I participated in it once so far, and then every subsequent time its happened since, <em>I forget, and forget, and forget</em>. But I do peek in every once in a while, when it happens, and I’m suddenly reminded that I forgot to participate. And … it’s kind of amazing?</p>

<p>In the past decade, social media has transformed into this thing where people are target searching. They’re looking for someone to dunk, looking for someone to use for engagement and five minutes of fame. Looking for things they hate so that they can react, and reaffirm to their followers that their opinions are the correct and best opinions to have.</p>

<p>In <em>some</em> cases, this is kind of exaggerated and not nearly as bad as it sounds. Taking a stand against injustice is <em>good</em>, even if there <em>are</em> people out there using these things for their own personal gain and fame. But, I’m trying to reinforce that, over all these years, a lot of social media has turned into this negative experience that most of us are <em>heavily</em> addicted to. No matter how bad the car crash, ya just can’t stop looking at it. The mangled metal, the broken glass, it’s like candy for the brain-juice. Uh … or maybe people don’t really look at a car crash like that, but you get what I mean!</p>

<p>And then you stumble into Mastodon, or the fediverse, and every Sunday there’s just people watching a dang movie. They’re not fighting, not spitting bile, just … enjoying something … together! In a fully digital space, where I’m <em>assuming</em> most people don’t even know each other!</p>

<p>It kind of reinforces this idea that the fediverse is the old web, reborn. The social web, resurrected. I <em>definitely</em> would’ve expected to see something like this on MySpace, if that sort of thing would’ve been possible back then. But definitely not on Twitter, or any of those other sites that are less about being social, and more about capital gains. And with all of the definitely <em>bad</em> things happening in the world, it’s just kind of nice to see totally normal and cool things happening. Totally nice things that definitely don’t suck.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this post just to say, keep it up! Let’s do more of this in different ways!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I didn’t really try to write a click-baity headline for this post.

Part of that is because my day job highly makes me feel like I don’t want to do <em>anything</em> when I get out of work. The other part of it, is that I spent hours and hours refreshing and updating the look and feel of my site (it’s cooler now). Now that I’ve done that, I’d like to write about Vivaldi.</p>

<p>A little while ago I wrote about the <a href="/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai">on-going blunders of the Mozilla Foundation</a>, and their head-long dive into AI, and the manipulation of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-search-update/" target="_blank">hiding data hijacking</a> within features that promise privacy. Basically, Mozilla needs money, and they’re selling their souls in order to get it.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and you <em>just want a good browser</em> that doesn’t have a ton of bloat, that isn’t taking your private data and selling it to some corporation, or what-have-you, then you already know what you need.</p>

<p><em>A better browser.</em></p>

<p>Firefox has been my go-to for a <em>long</em> time. It’s a decent browser! But, if I decide I want to actually interact with AI, I <em>don’t need it embedded in frikken’ Firefox</em>. And I don’t think this is where their resources, their time, and their effort should be going.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve switched to Vivaldi. A browser I <em>think</em> I’ve heard of before, but never really used? Never-the-less, I was pretty surprised when I finally did. I mean, right off the bat, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/" target="_blank">they’ve pledged</a> <em>not</em> to dedicate resources to integrate AI into their browser. Which, for all intents and purposes, that’s all you gotta say!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such, it does not feel right to bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a very hard-no on AI generated “art.” Ripping people off in order to funnel money into people’s pockets, who’ve done nothing but write a sentence, is the epitome of evil and greed. Using regular AI to generate text, or books, or anything of the sort, is definitely the <em>same kind</em> of plagiarist evil. But, I <em>will</em> acknowledge that there can be <em>some</em> uses in regard to AI chat bots … even though the power consumption is just as bad, or <em>worse</em> than the blockchain and NFTs. So, I find it <em>really</em> hard to justify using them. I <em>have</em>, though. I’ve asked an AI for some ideas on writing prompts to get my juices flowing. I’ve used an AI over my phone at work to help customers when I don’t know the answer to, “What kind of battery do I need for a Ford Pinto 1992, 4 cylinder, special edition, Pro Max?” And it has helped.</p>

<p>I will admit, and be transparent, in that I have personally found <em>some</em> use in these things. But I also ask myself, “Could I have just found this information on a search engine that isn’t mired by crud? Could I have done it without using a machine that’s on its way to being hooked up to a nuclear reactor twenty miles away from me?”</p>

<p>But, all of that’s beside my point in this article, in that, Vivaldi <em>isn’t</em> going to put this stuff into their browser. And they’re not <em>ignoring</em> their userbase in order to do whatever they want, for profit, and for violation of privacy. And that’s a big breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>And <em>all of this</em> is completely aside from the absolutely <em>cool as hell</em> features Vivaldi has built-in.</p>

<p>The browser … AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKS ADS! You don’t need an extension! IT WORKS ON YOUTUBE. You can just view websites, ad-free, by … opening your web browser? Holy crap.</p>

<p>Of course, you have customization options, sync options, theme options, password and bookmark import and saving, and so on and so forth. But what I’ve found <em>really</em> useful, is the right-side bar that you can <em>connect to your Apple calendar</em>, and the RSS feed aggregator that you can just plug some RSS into, and see updates from all the blogs you read, live, right there on the side of your browser. There’s a translate button, a note button, a reminders button, a button that opens their personal Vivaldi Mastodon instance, and <em>so much more</em>.</p>

<p>It’s the end-all, be-all of browsers, and I cannot believe that this isn’t some super famous, extremely well-known browser and company that’s taking the entire world by storm … <strong><em>Because they should be.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to write about how impressed I am with the Vivaldi browser. I can’t say I’m too sure what’s going on with the Social Web Foundation, but what that entails for sure remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I think you should <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">give it a go</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a couple of days since I’ve written anything.

These shorts continue a bit of a rejuvenated desire to keep my store running, by at least releasing something new <em>once a month</em>. As it turns out, pumping things out every other day was only ever really possible when I was without offline work.</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">Drop on by the store</a> within Second Life and check them out! Or, if you’re busy, in a jam, or generally unable to be in Second Life right this moment, you can see them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-OS95-Edition/26431919" target="_blank">marketplace page</a>.</p>

<p>You might notice that the store location has changed <em>again</em>, but let me explain. The current location is a backup that I’ve had for a little over a month, in the event that I would have to move from the location that was provided to me. It turns out, I unfortunately have to do that. I attribute no fault to Logan, and I extend my deepest gratitude for being allowed to use the land he had in order to host my store. It’s not every day you meet someone in Second Life who’s willing to offer a helping hand.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this won’t really affect the store, because it’ll now just be at my fully Backrooms/Pool Rooms themed location. And although the size may be deceiving, I actually have plenty of <em>space</em> to work with.</p>

<p>And to all of the frequent shoppers, and those who have continued to shop from, and visit [REVOSA] for nearly ten years going, <em>thank you</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, following the end of the month-long shopping event at the Progeny Mall, the Nano Nexus (OS95 Edition) shorts are now available at the store!
