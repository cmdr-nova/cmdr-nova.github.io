Not a secret, because I can’t stop talking about how conflicted and melancholy this makes me feel. It forces me to look back into the past, twenty some years ago when life was completely different. When things were simpler, and I was simultaneously more comfortable, and less worried, but angsty, and angry all of the time. Back when I lived in a most definitely haunted house, that still stands to this day. That I’ve promised to myself, that if ever I can afford to buy a house: That’s the one I’ll buy.</p>

<p>Thinking back 23 to 24 years ago, the memories in my head feel like … like something from another dimension. Something that wraps me in a lukewarm blanket of black and white, in the midst of Fall, and the silence of my bedroom where I once slept. Where I smoked cigarettes out the side-window, and sat at my 486 computer and waited for hours, <em>everyday</em>, for my internet girlfriends to log on AOL Instant Messenger. Where I spent most of my time trying to decide on the coolest anime wallpaper for my desktop, or prattling on and on about meaningless things on the message board, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030207160624/http://animeboards.com/" target="_blank">animeboards.com</a>. Where I decorated my room with goth and death inspired candles, and incense, and listened to KoRn and Marilyn Manson for hours and hours on infinite repeat.</p>

<p>The distant past feels like a place I could visit, if only I tried hard enough.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I pulled up my ex-girlfriend from the end of my high school years, on Facebook, and I sent her a semi-heartfelt message. I spoke about the reasons I broke up with her in 2004, what I really thought the future might’ve been months before I made that decision, in that time and period. And the things I didn’t express, such as how I wish I would’ve made different decisions. Wish I would’ve had my head on straight.</p>

<p>I miss it all.</p>

<p>I miss having all that energy. I miss not knowing what the future might be. I miss playing The Sims and torturing the Goth family while I renovated their house to be a castle of death.</p>

<p>I miss all the stupid things I said and did that ultimately ended up being experiences I would never forget.</p>

<p>I miss all the friends I had, and even the girl who only dated me for a week, in high school, only to ditch me for some other dude in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>I miss not feeling like my entire life is bound to be owned by a corporation, where I’ll do nothing but work and pay bills until the end of days.</p>

<p>But I think about all of these things and how, you know? I don’t <em>have</em> to be totally confined, a loner, a shut-in. I could get back out there, and do <em>new</em> things, make new memories, and <em>new</em> experiences. The problem is, I don’t know where to start anymore. Don’t know where to go, what to do.</p>

<p>I do know, that something’s gotta change. In the immediate future.</p>

<p>Because your whole life can’t just be a cascade of thoughts that all start with, “You know, I miss …”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="blogging" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="aging" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s not a secret that I turn 40 in May.

And I posted in reply, where I talked about how I was extending my website to make calls to a VPS in order to utilize Python to make it less “static.” But, that’s not really <em>the best</em> way to stay invested in maintaining your own personal website. You should stay invested, because, at the end of it all, and everything, and the oligarch-tech-complex that looms overhead, <em>it could end up being the only place where you’re able to speak.</em></p>

<p>Sure, your provider, be it Github Pages, or some VPS maintainer, they could just … pull the rug and offline your site in the blink of an eye. But, guess what! You’re smart. You build your website on your local machine, and then upload it to your server. So, you didn’t lose anything. You won’t <em>lose anything, ever</em>.</p>

<p>Think about how Twitter was overtaken, and maybe you said goodbye, and you deleted your account. A decade of your internet history, wiped clean from the internet. Think about going to Threads, and finding out Zuck is <em>even more of an asshole than you thought he was,</em> and so you left. Now you’ve joined Bluesky, or Mastodon. On Bluesky, what if some control-freak crypto-company buys the app, and then wipes your data? Or, something to that effect? What if you’re on Mastodon, and you take a break from social media, and then return, and the server you were on is gone?</p>

<p>Well, so’s your data, and your internet history, and all the work you’ve done.</p>

<p>This is not a criticism of ActivityPub, by the way. Maintaining community owned social media comes with some risks, and you should be prepared, <em>by having the bulk of your work, and words, and thoughts</em>, on a website of your own.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be flashy. It doesn’t have to look like it was developed by some 50-years-of-experience web developer. It just has to be <em>yours</em>.</p>

<p>Build, <em>something</em>, and then start jotting down your thoughts. Put up <a href="https://slashpages.net" target="_blank">slashpages</a>, and share your work, share your interests, share, <em>yourself</em>. And when you’re done doing all of that, <em>keep on writing.</em> Make new posts, put them in their own pages, share those pages to Mastodon, or Bluesky, or, wherever you are.</p>

<p>Speak your mind, and say whatever-the-fuck you want, because if you own the slate, it cannot be smashed by adult toddlers who want to take away everyone’s toys.</p>

<p>You want to know <em>how</em> to stay invested in maintaining your own website?</p>

<p><strong>Make your website the central communication and sharing platform, that’s all about you, that you own.</strong></p>

<p>You do that, and you’ll never stop messing with it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Webdev" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="indieweb" /><category term="webmaster" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was surfing the MelonLand forums, looking for interesting topics to read, or even reply to, and then I noticed one I had once replied to late last year, where a user was asking how to stay invested in their own website.

<p>Never-the-less, you can try it out, and also listen to soma.fm while you play.</p>

<p>There is no end-goal, there are no objectives.</p>

<p>The only point is to fly through infinite space while enjoying some music. Maybe we can call it, a self-care space exploration game, in JavaScript.</p>

And, you’re probably also <em>very</em> aware of the endless two-braincell-tech-dudes who post and write about how awesome it is to plagiarize and steal the work of artists to generate some quick, sloppy garbage for short-term gains. Well, if you’re like me, this <em>pisses you the frick off</em>, and in today’s post I’m going to help you completely block their grungy asses from accessing your website.</p>

<p>You may already have a robots.txt file, which provides the internets with a list of ai-gen slop-machines that you’d like to ask nicely, “Don’t crawl or scrape my site.” But, as we know, asking bots made by people and companies who don’t believe in the concept of consent, is like asking a serial killer not to kill. So, we’re not going to ask. We’re going to tell them to take their scraping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/how-openais-bot-crushed-this-seven-person-companys-web-site-like-a-ddos-attack/" target="_blank">DDOS machines</a>, and make like a screen door on a battleship, and get outta here.</p>

<p>This is <em>very</em> important to do, especially if you’re an independent party who hosts a website, or, say, a <em>Mastodon instance</em>, on your own personal VPS, that you pay for. A service that probably jacks up prices based on overages related to traffic.</p>

<p>So, let’s take off our pants and jacket, and get to it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of complicated ways to do this, that require all kinds of know-how about Apache and Nginx and all sorts of stuff that’ll probably give you a migraine. So, we’re going to make this really simple.</p>

<p>We’re going to use an .htaccess file.</p>

<p>Normally, you could use this to block access to your entire website for everyone <em>but you</em>, which can be useful for testing purposes, or to hide what you’re working on, or what-have-you. But, instead of doing that, we’re going to make it so these bots simply <em>do not</em> access your website, <em>at all</em>. No asking. Just punching them in the face, and leaving them unconscious in a gutter.</p>

<p>I run my website on Jekyll, so I decided to make a ruby that compiles my .htaccess file based on a json file that contains a list of AI scrapers. Once I build and serve my site, it regenerates the .htaccess file, <em>every single time</em>, based on what’s written in crawlers.json. In this way, I can <em>easily</em> add to it in the future, as morally corrupt businesses and corporations roll out even <em>more</em> <a href="https://cee.illinois.edu/news/AIs-Challenging-Waters#:~:text=Data%20centers%20are%20growing%20like%20weeds%2C%20and%20they%20are%20thirsty&amp;text=For%20example%2C%20Google's%20hyperscale%20data,day%20over%20the%20past%20year." target="_blank">water guzzling</a>, <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about" target="_blank">climate destroying</a> shit-machines.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> simply copy/paste the .htaccess file, but before we do that, I want to show you how to make it so you can do what I’m doing, if you’re using Jekyll, or something similar.</p>

<p>First, make the ruby gem in your site’s root directory, and call it something like, “generate_htaccess.rb”:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'json'

# Read the JSON file containing a list of crawlers, i.e., ai bots (the file doesn't *need* to be in assets/data/, that's just where I personally put it)
file_path = 'assets/data/crawlers.json'
crawlers = JSON.parse(File.read(file_path))['crawlers']

# Generate .htaccess
htaccess_content = &lt;&lt;~HTACCESS
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (#{crawlers.join('|')}) [NC]
  RewriteRule ^ - [F]
HTACCESS

# Write .htaccess
File.open('.htaccess', 'w') do |file|
  file.write(htaccess_content)
end
# Show output in the terminal
puts ".htaccess file generated successfully."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, create your “crawlers.json” file in whichever directory you’d like. Mine is in /assets/data, but if you change this, you’ll have to edit the “file_path” in the ruby gem in order for this to work. Here’s my crawlers.json:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
    "crawlers": [
      "AI2Bot",
      "Ai2Bot-Dolma",
      "Amazonbot",
      "anthropic-ai",
      "Applebot",
      "Applebot-Extended",
      "Bytespider",
      "CCBot",
      "ChatGPT-User",
      "Claude-Web",
      "ClaudeBot",
      "cohere-ai",
      "cohere-training-data-crawler",
      "Diffbot",
      "DuckAssistBot",
      "FacebookBot",
      "FriendlyCrawler",
      "Google-Extended",
      "GoogleOther",
      "GoogleOther-Image",
      "GoogleOther-Video",
      "GPTBot",
      "iaskspider/2.0",
      "ICC-Crawler",
      "ImagesiftBot",
      "img2dataset",
      "ISSCyberRiskCrawler",
      "Kangaroo Bot",
      "Meta-ExternalAgent",
      "Meta-ExternalFetcher",
      "OAI-SearchBot",
      "omgili",
      "omgilibot",
      "PanguBot",
      "PerplexityBot",
      "PetalBot",
      "Scrapy",
      "SemrushBot",
      "Sidetrade indexer bot",
      "Timpibot",
      "VelenPublicWebCrawler",
      "Webzio-Extended",
      "YouBot"
    ]
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’ve been following any of my Python projects, this will look similar to ways that I list, for example, subreddits for my “bots” to pull images from, and then post them to Mastodon. I like these json lists. It makes things real simple-like.</p>

<p>I took this list, and other ideas on how to do this, from <a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. I am personally subscribed to their RSS feed so that I can stay up-to-date with slop that’s being rolled out by the likes of Meta and other terrible corporations.</p>

<p>Finally, when building my Jekyll site locally, I use a shell script that does all sorts of things for me, such as, indexing all of my posts for my search engine, generating post metadata so that random posts can be shown at the bottom of other posts, and so on, and so forth. For this, though, we don’t need all of that. So, make a “serve.sh” (in your site’s root directory) that looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash

# Generate .htaccess file
ruby generate_htaccess.rb

# Build
bundle exec jekyll build

# Serve
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, as you’re updating your site on the local machine, and updating the build in order to admire your changes, or confirm that things are working, it’ll build a new .htaccess file, <em>every time you run this script</em>, and it’ll use the list of AI bots you’ve already provided (crawlers.json). This way, you can update the crawlers any time you want, and whenever you build your site locally, .htaccess gets updated (you should note, that executing Ruby without Ruby being installed, will do nothing, and it is assumed, that because you’re running Jekyll, you <em>do</em> have it installed).</p>

<p>Once you commit the site to live, it’ll already be done and generated, and for all intents and purposes, <em>this should stop these greedy, power-hungry mother assheads from accessing your website</em>.</p>

<p>The generated file should look something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (AI2Bot|Ai2Bot-Dolma|Amazonbot|anthropic-ai|Applebot|Applebot-Extended|Bytespider|CCBot|ChatGPT-User|Claude-Web|ClaudeBot|cohere-ai|cohere-training-data-crawler|Diffbot|DuckAssistBot|FacebookBot|FriendlyCrawler|Google-Extended|GoogleOther|GoogleOther-Image|GoogleOther-Video|GPTBot|iaskspider/2.0|ICC-Crawler|ImagesiftBot|img2dataset|ISSCyberRiskCrawler|Kangaroo Bot|Meta-ExternalAgent|Meta-ExternalFetcher|OAI-SearchBot|omgili|omgilibot|PanguBot|PerplexityBot|PetalBot|Scrapy|SemrushBot|Sidetrade indexer bot|Timpibot|VelenPublicWebCrawler|Webzio-Extended|YouBot) [NC]
RewriteRule ^ - [F]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, this website and <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank">my Mastodon instance</a> are on the same domain, but they <em>are not</em> on the same server. So, what I did for my Mastodon instance was this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh root@your_mastodon_instance_ip

su - mastodon

cd live

cd public

nano .htaccess

# copy/paste the generated .htaccess into this file with ctrl+shift+v

ctrl+O

ctrl+X
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Done.</p>

<p>The reason I’ve also included this on my Mastodon instance, is, partially, because I’ve noticed at least once a week, or every other week, there’s a <em>massive</em> spike of activity that causes my entire instance to go offline. And it <em>doesn’t come back up again</em>, until I force a power cycle, and then restart Mastodon streaming. I have some … <em>suspicions</em> that this is to do with sludge-scrapers, and so, <em>hopefully</em>, this does <em>something</em> for me.</p>

<p>And maybe also you.</p>

<p>But, there you have it.

This is <em>pretty</em> memory intensive on a 6 dollar VPS that I’m not interested in upgrading, just so that I can host a bajillion different proxy servers.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve been back to Mastodon, except, this time, hosting it myself, I figured, “Why not put the Fediverse comment sections back on each post?”</p>

<p>And so I have done that!</p>

<p>Now, you can continue seeing your replies to my blog posts on fedi, also show up here on my blog. It appears to work with other Mastodon instances, Wafrn, and <em>maybe</em> Sharkey/Misskey? Although, I’ve tested a Sharkey comment on a previous blog post, and it has not yet shown up. This could either be due to federation issues between my specific instance, with the Sharkey instance I posted from, <em>or</em> it could be due to slower federation. Meaning, it could show up sometime later. Not sure!</p>

<p>My <em>only</em> stipulation, is that I would <em>really</em> love if someone could help me figure out how to get a piece of JavaScript to automatically grab a post ID from the resulting Mastodon post that’s made once I make a <em>new</em> blog post (and then somehow also find a way to make it so that it inserts that post ID into the front matter of the corresponding post). I only <em>assume</em> this is possible, but it also sounds <em>extremely</em> complicated.</p>

<p>Unless I could use more server-side Python to accomplish this, altho, I would rather not run more proxy servers.</p>

<p>Either way, this is something that will be figured out … uh, eventually.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Fediverse" /><category term="fediverse" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="wafrn" /><category term="sharkey" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back, last year now, I briefly launched a Sharkey instance, and replaced my managed-host Mastodon instance, and since my fediverse comments on this blog weren’t completely compatible, I removed them and replaced them with an embedded comment section that makes calls to my VPS in order to store them.

In conjunction with A24, Backrooms, or The Complex, the MOVIE, is set to release … uh, sometime before I die of old age, hopefully! But, until then, we have content to watch from other, smaller-time creators.</p>

<p>I’m <em>very</em> selective with the Backrooms content I’ll watch. The silly, slides-and-coconut-milk (or whatever it is?) backrooms-wiki creations are … we’ll just say, mostly <em>bad</em>. Turning Backrooms into a huge thing that tons of people are adding to without any consideration for <em>what’s</em> being added, really takes the actual fear and immersion completely away from the concept. Which is why I don’t consume that content.</p>

<p>I pretty much <em>only</em> watch Backrooms content that is either Kane Pixels, or works inspired by it.</p>

<p>And, even then, sometimes those videos are a little iffy. Sometimes the pacing of the camera-holder versus their footstep movement doesn’t match up well, at all. Sometimes the textures have bad lighting and it’s extremely obvious that they’re just recording in Blender, hence, breaking immersion. Other times, they’ll try to incorporate scenes with actual people in them, or the person who’s lost, themselves, and they’re <em>really</em> not great looking 3D models.</p>

<p>Kane is the masterclass, and there are some who follow the formula well.</p>

<p>Today, I discovered TheMrLeoniasty on Youtube, through his Tape 1 video, and it’s really something else. It’s not 100% perfect, some of the pacing is a little off, but it doesn’t try and take the usual formula that most everyone else does (think: howler / bacteria chase scenes that happen in every single video). It, instead, does something <em>entirely</em> different (although, I’m not sure yet how I feel about the PS2 boot screen).</p>

<p>It’s very slow paced, until the end. The end is absolutely something to behold, as a Backrooms enjoyer.</p>

<p>Watch.</p>

Standing outside my static mansion on a hill that no one visits but me, because nobody else is allowed, I try to think of something interesting to write about. I <em>do</em> kind of tire of writing on negative topics, and topics I have to constantly cite with outbound links, screenshots, and facts. That stuff takes me such a long time to write. But today, I think I want to talk about ramen.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/ramen/Screenshot from 2025-01-11 22-35-02.png" /></p>

<p>It took me an enormous amount of time in my life to finally have an actual <em>good</em> bowl of ramen, that wasn’t some bouillon chicken mess in a styrofoam cup. And that was … about three years ago. From a restaurant that, unfortunately, shutdown. I think they were called, <em>Taste of Asia</em>. And, although, I’ve never had the delight of going to Japan, or Korea, or Indonesia, I can say that <em>if I did</em>, I would eat ramen, <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>I remember it like it was almost yesterday. I ordered a bowl of ramen through DoorDash, and it came in this giant plastic container, and it wasn’t just the noodles. It had all the garnish: the seaweed, the pork, the egg, the noodles, and the broth. For this, I had bought a pair of wooden chopsticks, just to feel like I was doing something authentic. And then I took the first bite.</p>

<p>It was like how I would imagine Gordon Ramsay feels when he takes a bite of Beef Wellington that’s done right. It was <em>amazing</em> (I am by no means comparing myself to Gordon Ramsay, I cannot cook, not like that). And it was at that moment that Top Ramen, and Maruchan became <em>dead to me</em>.</p>

<p>It was like, “Wow! Ramen is supposed … to be FLAVORFUL?!” And my god, it was.</p>

<p>Flash forward to today, and I have specific instant ramen brands that I like, and I <em>will not</em> eat anything else.</p>

<p>Those brands are Shin Black, Samyang Buldak, and Sapporo Ichiban.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nongshim-Premium-Instant-Vegetables-Microwaveable/dp/B00BEIKRBY?crid=2RE7NPU9EHR9K&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xHXapwCC-Pv1Rkl5NuAhr0c8kYwdRXFVhgSX-3UMw0Wnvc9qqQeRxHo7Os5h8UClrR95R2fnI59DCUvniIQ92ulpZNCh3gDHVS-XQcu7YgRoNxd-_DU4JTEKQvlF-znZx7qEpJOyey2WqvqmL8nqYSsGfpEBBZEPVnJjzicej_ObtMyjtjr4P8nlSscijr37CgwE79hgwNbwG06SKq77-KOi53SrAKlTv61lh5M15HuamGc8W2yCAWjCEs77oKA0Dp6atgNk01_BB71fBfjUpt0hRfDGzwi4pfS1VvDHLviVyWwmp32otbymQ9ApZHoxaRgMpuB8k1zVlF-JCBVzf9EQKh49UT3fxxbxodlmZnSEL1o00hLvn3AYoJTxgER2Bg4Os61GXeBN08gSxkk05zJ8DrDq5eIi5c9brGmIZ5t1VYe6j-IEpYTIFxVXbxqK.lcdRf5LTMCSCsoWYfPlylZYKYyhJLOodMyNpt1vj4Yo&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=shin%2Bblack%2Bramen&amp;qid=1736653783&amp;rdc=1&amp;sprefix=shin%2Bblack%2Bramen%2Caps%2C160&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1" target="_blank">Shin Black</a> is a very deep flavor, with a spicy kick to it, and it’s only “failing,” if you can call it that, is that they add no MSG to it. There are a lot of misconceptions about MSG, and although, it is <em>of course</em>, not healthy, it’s mostly fine.</p>

<p>My second favorite is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samyang-Chicken-Stir-Fried-Instant-Carbonara/dp/B0C85RZWP3?crid=131JM9EPLBZT8&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6A_Wx8Fgg5bqODsI4eTvqrnOGnYuDJutso-YGIlKV0s-sFrFLP5UYlj2Q157ri2xOEtloVA0pXoesaHFZIOJGnM6Qr9M5M85HMwI19KhZfcZXkQpyBAdY-jQF2o8VelyMl5jFmdPdaLXNc80P0u7-ur2ehMJd33qrE_w-Gq5VGluynQOpRJcvL-dlttRjmQUcA4G1TRW4R6-hZlZlQMcrK1HuVfiz_4HgragJ_0E2NkFOI8UlEpIzzhN-vnw8eapvY05aLJW5FWec81mK5cMUyw-yLrr8gDGU88ZGjDBZLg.MIN95VxYZgR_yZ4f6sLG8mY65sCrmJCVgldhPx1qc-4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=buldak+ramen&amp;qid=1736653938&amp;sprefix=buldack+rame%2Caps%2C107&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Samyang Buldak</a>, which <em>I think</em> went viral on Tik-Tok for some reason? But, I eat Buldak when I want to punish my stomach with flavor, and fire. You know, you gotta remind yourself that you’re <em>alive</em> sometimes, and the best way to do that, is to punch your stomach in the stomach with knives known as chili peppers.</p>

<p>My only downfall is that as I get older, I can’t handle intense spice as much as I used to, but I also partially blame the “one chip challenge” in damaging my stomach (because I’m pretty sure it did).</p>

<p>And then, at the top of my list, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapporo-Ichiban-Ramen-Noodles-Original/dp/B00N3K2I7C?crid=38KAYZH9AQS00&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q27X2atTczpdkfJHBSaPeKqPahqyU_Pjj15jmlHLcD0q3jXsg6MvZcPik47MPIk7qU_NElfaZ-cuOt2Zk0QbpjUMMKUP7oCKYiKKEqaONMH7TuIkKu7LzBkTT0pkJBm_FVMlQNbcWL5Hbu1F7Euz9n0KTfGfl5cYY_2tm2pYX2W-NnogOSV39jYWm3nhZl03egJXc6gdSbkiNUDNQhODxmNXrofOxT5qh_Dsycav_8hYn8UfnhoFMdqhXFVuBooCWb-anKczlJ8qxcRCLxFsnUeQIylv4cLSlp7ieuKvZ5nvvOqQc2g1rPZtZhD_ULES18ceF83Qkzzl0I4F-XeH2sL7E0qh9pb_bSy4APnhCw9dzs1zWCYCwZ5USa8mWzOQA0jtSsrmOUSJPP_-g_2bfcroWmNnuSD3PIhjSxx6mP9N6Vrt1N62U_qT9nRk_-A7.bKFf-8TaiM8U2_kL0nIb71K88IV6QX64sMXkZqnJ3gQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=sapporo%2Bichiban%2Bramen&amp;qid=1736654126&amp;rdc=1&amp;sprefix=sappora%2Bic%2Caps%2C115&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1" target="_blank">Sapporo Ichiban</a>. These noodles aren’t for committing crimes against yourself. It’s got a very rich flavor, it has the MSG, and it’s not punishing to your stomach. Sapporo is for when I’m on a day off from work, and I’m doing for myself a little bit of self care, and I want something easy, and also <em>good</em> to eat. This is my favorite instant noodle of all time.</p>

<p>But, there is a reason I eat all of this in moderation, and that’s because <em>they’re all absolutely filled to the brim with sodium</em>, and there is definitely value in understanding, that there can be too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>People who know me, know that I like to joke about pizza, but, pizza is only my second favorite food. Ramen is number one, and I don’t really speak about it. You wouldn’t know this unless you’ve just read this blog post.</p>

<p>Which brings me to what made me want to post this, and that is this video posted by someone I know on the fediverse, of multiple professional chefs critiquing instant ramen noodles. I recommend a watch!</p>

Others, it exists, maybe, as more of a hobby. For me, that’s mostly what it is, for now. But this all comes with a downside, because, like in the real world, the customer sometimes thinks they know best, and if you’ve ever worked retail, you know how very wrong that is.</p>

<p>I touched on this topic a little bit via Mastodon while I was on break at work, but I wanted to break it down in more detail, because this is a problem I see a lot of in Second Life. I’m not saying this is <em>every person in the virtual world who buys things</em>, but it is more or less, a pretty pervasive idea that I don’t think gets challenged enough. But, to break <em>that</em> down, basically, when people sell things in Second Life, you can sell it with permissions that allow a buyer to modify your content to their liking. You can <em>also</em> choose not to do this, in order to keep your work the way it is when it’s sold (especially if you want to sell different variations, which is, again, entirely up to the creator). Some people have a <em>very big problem</em> with the latter …</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/sl-stores/IMG_8137.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is a screenshot of a Reddit post that got a lot of traction … a lot of people in agreement, and because Reddit is a place where dissenting opinions get buried and heckled, I felt it a good idea to write it all up here. So, let’s tear this apart, shall we?</p>

<blockquote>
As I'm customising my avatar more and getting more creative. I'm realising that there's no good reason for 99% of clothing to be non mod Perm (especially if it's a fatpack).
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of this language will probably be pretty alien to people who don’t peruse Second Life, so … “fatpack” is something creators make that contain all variations of a certain product, such as a shirt. We’ll go with that. So, a creator makes a black shirt, and a white shirt, and then maybe five other colors, and they sell them all individually. Then, what they’ll do, is they’ll make a pack that contains all of them together, along with, maybe, a couple bonuses for buying that pack, i.e., a “fatpack.”</p>

<p>I don’t see any real problem with this, but we’ll get into that when I’m done here.</p>

<p>This Redditor believes there’s “no good reason” for most clothing to not to be modifiable by the buyer. And I say, there is a good reason! If a creator <em>wants</em> to sell their virtual clothing in specific colors, patterns and textures, and not allow people to change this, that’s up to them! You are <em>not</em> the person running the store. You are not the person <em>creating</em> these things. And <em>most of it</em> is sold for prices <em>below</em> 2000 linden.</p>

<p>A fatpack will usually run anywhere between 600 to 1200 linden. And maybe you’re thinking, “Whoa, is that expensive?”</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Some people look at that pricing, <em>within</em> Second Life, and they’ll call it expensive. They always do. But why don’t we look at the actual exchange rate.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/sl-stores/Screenshot from 2025-01-09 22-29-48.png" /></p>

<p>So … for less than a value meal at McDonalds, or a cup of coffee at Starbucks, you can buy an entire set of clothing? For a little bit less than 5 dollars USD?</p>

<p>Another way to look at this, is that people are spending <em>hours</em> and <em>hours</em> on making clothing and accessories for people to buy, to customize their avatars, and to spice up their little virtual lives, <em>for almost nothing</em>. For less than a Fiverr gig. When, in the real world, if I were making you a custom 3D modeled product for a <em>game</em>, with complete textures, UV mapping, skeleton rigging, and weight painting … I would charge you <em>at least 500 dollars</em>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we’re talking about Second Life, where all of that work is done behind-the-scenes, and people sell things at prices that are easily digestible to the masses, which, I think <em>is beyond fair.</em> It’s almost highway robbery.</p>

<blockquote>
Removing hidden faces, unliking and linking items is a must. Especially because you often start running against attachment limits.
</blockquote>

<p>We step into the next point of this user’s argument, in that, their perceived issue, is that clothing in link-sets should be able to be de-linked, because sometimes you run into an issue where your avatar has <em>too many attachments</em>, and you can’t wear something that you want. And, a linkset, is basically just <em>gluing</em> different items together so that they count more as one, but, even in doing that, they still cost server resources.</p>

<p>So you can only attach so many resources to your avatar until you hit that limit, you know, so that you don’t become a walking DDoS.</p>

<p>But … what’s the attachment limit in 2025, for a Second Life avatar?</p>

<p>Quoted directly from the <a href="https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Limits#:~:text=general%20inworld%20experience.-,Avatar,and%20choosing%20Edit%20My%20Outfit." target="_blank">Second Life Wiki</a>, “Max. # of attachments - 38 combined HUD and body attachments.”</p>

<p>An outfit someone might wear, will usually consist of a top, a bottom, and maybe shoes. So we’re talking … three to four attachment points. But then, of course, you have to account for your body, whether the hands and feet are separate, your hair, maybe custom eyes, and even fingernails.</p>

<p>So what would that run you?</p>

<p>To be generous, we’ll just say … 15. Even though that’s more than what I’ve listed, we’ll go with 15, to be fair to the original quoted post.</p>

<p>You’ve <em>still got 23 additional attachment points</em>.</p>

<p>Now, some people like to wear HUDs, like body HUDs that make hiding texture faces on your body easier (although, I’m not sure why you would wear this at all times), or gaming HUDs, like a system that makes it so your avatar is a vampire, or sexual HUDs that make your virtual life a little more … spicy. And, of course, you probably walk around with the HUD for your head on, at least, <em>sometimes</em>, so that you can control your eye and mouth movements.</p>

<p>But … that’s like, maybe 3 to 5 more attachment points.</p>

<p>You’ve still got a lot to go.</p>

<p>I can’t remember if server weight is counted in addition to attachment points, but we’ll just say, <em>it is</em>, and some of these attachments are taking up multiple points. Odds are, you’ve still got room to put more stuff on your avatar.</p>

<p>My point here, is that, <em>in most cases</em>, this is a complete non-issue, and it’s an excuse being made in order to aid the original argument. That creator’s should do what non-creator’s say, or else. And maybe you’re thinking, “Wh … what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>Just wait.</p>

<blockquote>
When you're new, you don't care and I think it's a bit cash grabby to sell non mod Items with shiny branding pages and stores.
<br /><br />
There are so many stores that are less shiny on the outside but their stuff is amazing and mod Perm.
</blockquote>

<p>I’m going to tackle both of these points together, because this is already pretty long. So. This kind of circles back to my point on pricing, and how <em>utterly entitled it is</em> to say that creators in Second Life are pushing out “cash grabs” when they decide they want to sell specific colors and designs, that you can’t rip out and replace with … whatever.</p>

<p>That sounds, not just entitled, but … and this is a little ironic, but <em>greedy</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what being “new” has to do with this.</p>

<p>But then in their continued final point, basically, stores that aren’t flashy and less established are, apparently, more inclined to sell their products with the ability to tear things apart, and do with them whatever a customer pleases. And hey, that’s also fine! If someone wants to sell their products in a way that makes it so customers can do whatever they want, go ahead!</p>

<p>There is no wrong way to be a creator in Second Life, and you can do whatever you want, <em>because it is your work.</em></p>

<p>And now, we’re going to circle back to my comment that hinted at an ultimatum …</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/sl-stores/Screenshot from 2025-01-09 22-56-08.png" /></p>

<p>So, and this is also a point I’ve seen come up elsewhere, in that, and I’m going to be blunt, these <em>entitled as all hell people</em>, are trying to say that if a creator sells their work in a way that you can’t modify it, this <em>incentivizes</em> people to steal. To use ToS breaking scripts to rip your work out of Second Life, and to then re-upload it so that anything they want to do with it, can be done, for <em>free</em>.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that there are unscrupulous, grifting, uncreative, jerks out there in the world. We know this, <em>especially now</em>, because of generative AI. But to say that creators should let you tear their work apart, or have it stolen … That’s just ridiculous. It’s <em>especially</em> ridiculous, when you realize that there <em>are</em> people stealing work in Second Life, that costs, <em>most of the time</em>, less than five dollars to have.</p>

<p>When I say, there are some petty, entitled people in Second Life, <strong>I mean it</strong>.</p>

<p><em>A large majority of work sold on the Second Life marketplace goes for less than even a dollar, sometimes 30 to 50 cents!</em></p>

<p>And there are people <em>threatening to steal the work of these creators</em>, because they want to color the shirt you made baby-puke green.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed running a store in Second Life for 10 years, and I’ll continue to do so, in exactly the way that I want, with complete disregard for what people like this think. Because they need hobbies. They need things to occupy themselves.</p>

<p>They remind me of the people who walk into Walmarts with shitty attitudes, who yell at staff about pricing, and about item availability, and then stomp their feet and whine like a baby.</p>

<p>Because that’s what they are.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Second-Life" /><category term="secondlife" /><category term="metaverse" /><category term="creators" /><category term="stores" /><category term="virtualworld" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Second Life, anyone can be a creator, and make their creations available to the virtual world for purchase, and some have found major success with this.

For a long period of time, I hadn’t been doing this, partially because I don’t like bandwagons, and also because there are <em>regular, decent</em> people on Threads that I personally wanted to see. But, now it’s a bit more than a lost cause, and the social network is nothing <em>but</em> a detriment to the open social web.</p>

<p>The people I liked seeing updates from will just have to move to Mastodon, or some other fediverse software.</p>

<p>But, the other reason I wanted to post this, is because there are a lot of people who trot out their reasoning, or why they’ve blocked them from the start. Whether it’s performative or not, I remained skeptical for a long period of time. Skeptical, because I have experience from within the fediverse of numerous people, moderators, and admins saying one thing, or that they <em>stand</em> for one thing, and then they do the opposite.</p>

<p>And this has made me <em>more</em> critical, <em>more</em> skeptical, and <em>more</em> distrusting of others.</p>

<p>Yes, I have spoken about this before, but since it’s been about a year or so (or more?) since this all happened, I want to <em>again</em> bring light to the actions of the administrator and moderation team behind the Mastodon instance … hackers.town.</p>

<p>It was some time around August 25th of 2023, that I was posting on my timeline over at HT about … I don’t know, something to do with how resilient my Macbook was. I was kind of stanning Apple real hard around that time, just because I enjoyed/liked their hardware. Never-the-less, a user by the name of 0xSH00T (who now, at least, appears to be banned and erased, over a <em>year</em> later) jumped in to make some vitriolic remarks about myself, my having posted on the timeline, and my choice in hardware.</p>

<p>It was a <em>stupid</em> thing to get angry about, and it was a <em>stupid</em> thing to troll someone over.</p>

<p>He escalated, <em>I</em> escalated, and I don’t claim to be of perfect cognitive or mental health. <em>I have my issues</em>, and I deal with them.</p>

<p>I told him, and I quote, “Go fuck yourself, eat a pile of dicks and delete your goddamn account.”</p>

<p>Yes, this is kind of … haha, ANGRY.</p>

<p>And I had every right to be.</p>

<p>In a direct message that no longer contains the originating message from the admin (@thegibson), I responded, “I’m here minding my own business mostly just talking to myself, and this person comes into my mentions swinging, I’m not tolerating any both sides-ing bullshit. Delete the instigator or I’m out.”</p>

<p>Because, he and his mod-team, very much <em>were</em> playing the “both sides” card. In response to a troll, who was, in fact, instigating a fight.</p>

<p>I didn’t really <em>want</em> to leave hackers.town (and I wouldn’t have, anyway, I just wanted the troll to, at minimum, be moderated). I was in a blood-haze, and kind of spiraling a bit. Just like when it happened on the instance over at deadinsi.de, where just about the same things had gone on, and the admin and moderator team had a lapse in judgment. That’s … that’s what we’ll call it, I guess.</p>

<p>I made an off-the-cuff post about PTSD, I told Gibson again something like, “either you ban this asshole, or you ban me” and rather than doing any real moderation work, I was, of course, banned.</p>

<p>This was not the outcome I <em>thought</em> would take place. At least not at the time.</p>

<p>Again, I was spiraling. I was in a much worse mental place than I am now.</p>

<p><em>Of course</em>, I shouldn’t have been banned. If someone is having a break in mental health, and spiraling out (crashing out, as the zoomers would say) over being harassed over and over, as a responsible administrator, or moderator, <em>you take action against the instigator, no matter the personal relationship you hold with them.</em></p>

<p>Over this <em>tiny</em>, insignificant instance of abuse, I lost <em>years</em> of my presence on the fediverse, <em>indefinitely</em>. There were never any talks or apologies once the dust had settled. There was never any further action taken, appeals never read, never looked at, never considered. And yet, for <em>whatever reason</em>, my account still stands, frozen in time (suspended, but viewable), and now linking to my account on my own instance … <em>where this type of thing will never happen</em>.</p>

<p>You cannot call yourself an instance, a server, that is tolerant, and forward-thinking, and “for the people,” if your personal relationships come first. Especially if those personal relationships are with instigative assholes who shouldn’t exist on your platform. This is going to sound really self-absorbed, but <em>I am a better administrator and moderator than anyone at hackers.town by 1000 miles,</em> and I will stand by that, into the future. Because I will never let this happen.</p>

<p>Even if my server is only ever myself, and one other person, trolls will never gain the upper-hand, because I will never make excuses for anyone who’s being a shit.</p>

<p>And that’s why, when people start posting on the federated timeline, about how bad you are if you don’t, or haven’t had Threads blocked, I have to stop and question: Is there an ulterior motive here? Should I <em>care</em> what any of these people think? What have they done in their positions that they likely haven’t answered for?</p>

<p>And, thankfully, in a lot of instances, none of this applies. They’re just thoughts … most of the time.</p>

<p>But there are people out there in the fediverse who are <em>just as bad</em> as the people you’d hope to escape by leaving Twitter, or Threads, and I think it’s important to realize that no place is perfect. The open social web, Mastodon, and ActivityPub is something I will continue to, and <em>always</em> support. But … it’s important to know that it’s not all just roses and candy.</p>

<p>Jerks, and people not fit to moderate, exist, <em>everywhere</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="fediverse" /><category term="meta" /><category term="threads" /><category term="facebook" /><category term="instagram" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As per my last post this morning (in regard to Meta’s loosening of moderation, as if it wasn’t already loose enough), I, as the admin of mkultra.monster, will be blocking federation with Threads.
