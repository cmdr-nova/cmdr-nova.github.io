But, these kinds of takes were inevitable, since corporate social media is already a thunder-dome of garbage, and <em>of course</em> there are people who want to see Mastodon and other extended ActivityPub apps mirror that. What I’m talking about, this time, though, is “influencers.”</p>

<p>I wrote last year, somewhere along the line, about how the influencer mindset is a disease, and I <em>still</em> hold that position.</p>

<p>Algorithmic feeds have been <em>the worst thing</em> to happen to the social web, because, again and again, the only thing it does is center and reward people who <em>lie, cheat, and scam</em>. Wannabe “influential” people who latch onto a trend, or a brand, and say intentionally disingenuous, or sometimes even <em>nasty</em> things, <em>just to get a reaction.</em> Because that’s what does numbers on algorithmic social media, and that is, in-turn, <em>how they get paid</em>.</p>

<p>ActivityPub and the Fediverse is rightfully attractive to many people. Something that’s hundreds to thousands of people hosting their own version of a piece of software, that anyone can use, so that none of the social network is governed by any single entity, therefore ensuring that the Twitter problem, essentially, <em>never happens</em>. That’s really cool, right?</p>

<p>So, it would make sense, that, in time, it would attract people who think like this:</p>

<blockquote>
"I like that there's no influencers/clout chasers/celebrities on the fediverse"

Ok, but you do realize you're saying you like that people can't make a living here, right? That what happens here can't affect the larger world. That the big closed networks will never be supplanted by this one. You get that, right? 

I mean, this is a communication tool. We're communicating with each other. It's such a small understanding of what that means if it's not to influence the world we live in. 

And, frankly, it's entitled to insist that everyone else should abide by that narrow sensibility.
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I’m not including who said this, because I’m trying to be a little nicer, and to also not look like I’m trying to target anyone. Partially because I’m now a moderator on a community instance, and it’s important that people don’t think I’m some kind of asshole who hates everything and is trying to take people down, but also because <em>I’m not trying to target anyone</em>.</p>

<p>But I <em>do</em> want to talk about this, regardless, because I feel like if people come to the Fediverse with these lines of thinking, and nobody goes, “Hold up, let me tell you why we don’t want this here.” We may just end up with an instance or two full of people trying to exploit others for their own personal gain.</p>

<p>And that’s honestly what an influencer is. Except, I think we need to look at individual points here.</p>

<blockquote>
Ok, but you do realize you're saying you like that people can't make a living here, right? That what happens here can't affect the larger world. That the big closed networks will never be supplanted by this one. You get that, right? 
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I don’t really know of any studies that have ever been done on influencers, but <em>I’m pretty sure</em> making any kind of a living doing it, is only something that’s afforded to those who are either <em>very lucky</em>, or <em>already rich</em>.</p>

<p>And, saying that … this is bad, because if you can’t make a living and get rich on, say, Mastodon, you’re not affecting the larger world? As if a platform is only important if it’s making someone who posts engagement bait rich, otherwise it’s, what? Trivial? Useless?</p>

<p>The big closed networks being the way that they are, <em>is the reason</em> ActivityPub exists. Apps like Mastodon weren’t developed as a replacement for Twitter. They were developed <em>as an alternative</em> for people who just want a <strong>social</strong> network. That’s a big thing here, because I feel like the social part of being online has been nearly dead for the past 20 years. And, if you want to get an idea of what I’m even talking about, you don’t even have to look at Twitter.</p>

<p>Go open Threads. Post a few times, mingle with the people.</p>

<p>Tell me what it looks like when your social network is nothing but influencers trying to get rich off of engagement.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, I want you to tell me if you feel like Threads is useful, and not entirely pointless to regular people.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You’re right, disembodied voice of someone dissenting about the theme and point of ActivityPub, it is a <em>communication tool</em>. Communication is not something that influencers engage in.</p>

<p>And I can tell you right now, that ActivityPub and the Fediverse has very much influenced the world, <em>even if</em> grind-set, money-brained (or celebrities, if anyone actually cares about what celebrities think) people refuse to use it. You wouldn’t have posted this diatribe via Mastodon if the network hadn’t influenced you to be there. I know, you’re probably looking at this, and if you know me, you’re going, “Hey, but don’t you sell digital albums and other things?”</p>

<p>Yeah, I do. But we’ll get to that.</p>

<blockquote>
And, frankly, it's entitled to insist that everyone else should abide by that narrow sensibility.
</blockquote>

<p>This is mostly the end of this person’s rant, and there’s really not a whole lot to address here, aside from the fact that … this is a projection. Yes, <em>it is</em> entitled to insist that everyone should abide by your narrow sensibilities. Being as that, you are the only one complaining about this.</p>

<p>Speaking of “making money” on the fediverse, though, I want to share something.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/influencer-problem/sales.png" /></p>

<p>These are my all-time sales from Bandcamp, over the course of the past 7 or 8 years. Now, obviously, if you’re a more popular artist, or regularly use algorithmic social media, maybe you’ve made much more than me. That’s not what matters, here, though.</p>

<p>Where do you think a majority of these sales came from? Twitter?</p>

<p>Nah.</p>

<p>Although, these numbers, if you look at them over the span of 7-8 years, really aren’t that huge … but, it’s <em>still pretty huge</em> that I’ve made around 4000 USD in sales, largely from just sharing and talking about my work on Mastodon.</p>

<p>Now, obviously, I’m not rich. Most of, if not all of this money has gone toward life expenses and bills, and absolutely none of that is still in any of my accounts.</p>

<p>But it’s still pretty impressive, at least, if you’re someone who thinks it’s not possible to make money on the Fediverse.</p>

<p>That’s just it though. I’m not <em>on</em> the Fediverse to “make money.” Sure, I share my work and sometimes I make sales, but that’s not the reason I’m there. I don’t view social media and people who follow me as a potential transaction. I don’t view other people as numbers on a spreadsheet, with AI-brainstorming about how I can draw more engagement out of them.</p>

<p>I don’t do <em>any of that shit</em>.</p>

<p>Treating every interaction as a transaction, or the potential for a monetary transaction, is <em>inherently</em> toxic, manipulative, and antithetical to a social web. If this upsets you, and you don’t want to be part of something like this … you don’t have to be! You can go be on Threads, you can go be on Twitter, or, hey, you can go be on Bluesky! Where they’ve just suddenly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/bluesky-verification-blue-check-twitter-x" target="_blank">decided to start giving “notable” users an ego boost</a>.</p>

<p>It’s up to you!</p>

<p>That’s the beauty, or <em>at least was</em>, the beauty of the internet, before it was overtaken by oligarchs and corporations. You could just … <em>do whatever you wanted</em>, and it didn’t have to be for any specific reason other than to meet people and chill. Which is (one of) the whole point of the internet!</p>

<p>Corporatizing ActivityPub would be the beginning of its downfall, and I’m glad that people who think everything should be corporate and influential to grind-set, mindset weirdos, <em>don’t like it.</em> Let’s keep it that way.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="influencers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I’m going to talk about something that someone decided to complain about, on the Fediverse, that most of us on the aforementioned verse are extremely opposed to.

A lot of that has to do with me filling my free time with building a ridiculous world around my base in Minecraft Java (heavily modded), and jumping back into World of Warcraft on my original DeathKnight from … uh, whatever year Wrath of the Lich King released. And that kind of has to do with why I want to write this today. Why I want to write about how Discord, the community chat app, has, and <em>is</em>, killing communities not only around the web, but also within games.</p>

<p>I think I’ve written before about how Discord has almost completely killed usage of internet forums (which is partially why I decided to host <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster/" target="_blank">my own forum</a>, even if nobody feels like joining it), which is <em>terrible</em> for retention of data online. Especially if you’re someone who uses search engines to find answers to questions, none of the problem solving happening within Discord channels is searchable on Google, and is absolutely <em>not permanent</em>.</p>

<p>And now, that problem will be <em>especially</em> exasperated, as the <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-cuts-funding-for-internet-archive" target="_blank">government defunds grants related to the Internet Archive</a>, one of many horrible moves to erase, destroy, and replace history as we know it.</p>

<p>But … I’m getting a little off-topic.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this today, because this is a problem I’ve seen grow more and more over the years. It’s related to World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, or basically any online game where players are supposed to talk with each other <em>within those games</em>.</p>

<p>But that’s not happening, is it?</p>

<p>I log onto World of Warcraft and encounter players in-game. Nobody speaks. I do casual dungeons with random groups. The tank bursts through everything, not even paying even a single bit of attention to the other group members around them. And, once the final boss is beaten, the group disbands, all without anyone ever speaking a word. This was a little bit of an issue ten years ago, and it’s only gotten worse.</p>

<p>I also have personal experience with joining <em>guilds</em>, places that are supposed to be <em>communities</em>, where, instead of any of that, you’re immediately assaulted with Discord links.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to join our Discord!”</p>

<p>So, instead of people speaking in groups, in guild chat, or in the game <em>at all</em>, communication has moved to the modernized IRC and AOL Instant Messenger merger chat client.</p>

<p>Oh, … great.</p>

<p>So, instead of speaking to you and other members of a guild inside of the actual game, I have to tab out of the game and talk in your closed channels on a proprietary app that has already singlehandedly all but murdered old-net social media?</p>

<p>I even went on the World of Warcraft forums and responded to a thread where someone asks, “How do you meet people in-game?” and I responded, “It’s simple. I don’t.” And someone felt they needed to reply with, “Join Discord servers!”</p>

<p>Look. I think Discord is alright for keeping up with friends and people I know, and there are some uses of servers, like the server I use to connect my Patreon and content I make or write, but also?</p>

<p><strong>Fuck Discord</strong>.</p>

<p>This is <em>also</em> a problem in Second Life, a virtual world that is <em>literally described</em> as a 3D chat application, where, now, <em>almost everyone is exclusively speaking in Discord channels instead of <strong>in</strong> Second Life!</em></p>

<p>How does this kill communities?</p>

<p>Instead of walking around within games and virtual worlds, and meeting people naturally, everyone’s ignoring each other until the off-chance they speak in Discord.</p>

<p>Do I have to detail how this is terrible for the health of communities?</p>

<p>Who wants to play a game filled with millions of people that is now essentially singleplayer until you join the app that’s harvesting all of your data?</p>

<p>But, I understand I’m mostly blowing hot air here. Me posting this won’t stop this from happening, and it’ll probably only get worse and worse. That’s the way of the world nowadays, anyway.</p>

<p>It’s only a matter of time before our actual society mirrors some dystopian depiction of what society might be like if all the wrong things happen and nobody says or does anything.</p>

<p>And I’ve been wondering: Am I just being old, yelling at clouds while new things take over?</p>

<p>20 years ago, old people were yelling about how smartphones wouldn’t improve anything, or in the 90s, about how the internet was a passing fad. But, I think both of these things improved society, even if, 20 years later, both smartphones and the internet are being turned into projections of evil via oligarchs and corporations. And, that’s why I don’t really think this is about just “being old,” and more, I think it’s just about people accepting shit, and consuming shit, because they don’t know any better.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="discord" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a little while since I’ve written on an actual topic.

I mean, you can see me posting daily on Akkoma from right here on the site. But, I’m deep into the night shift at work now, and coupled with the ten hour shifts, and the constant overtime … I’m tired?</p>

<p>I have a whole album I need to work on, a book I want to get back to writing, and this website that I want to continue writing on, and I’m going to do all of that. When I can figure out how to rebalance my life so that <em>other things still fit into it</em>.</p>

<p>I kind of feel like a ghost a lot of the time, because I come home, feed my Minecraft addiction, and then sleep, wake up, shower, and head back to work.</p>

<p>It’s taken over so much of my life, that I’m swiping on dating apps <em>while I walk through hallways</em> at work. It’s not that I couldn’t do this at home, but more like I just don’t have the energy for anything right now. And that’s not good. Time is passing us by!</p>

<p>But some of this <em>does</em> have to do with me constantly being in Minecraft. I don’t know. I just feel like building and digging out mines! But, there’s the book in the back of my mind asking me when I’m going to continue writing it. If I’m going to get over the anxiety of the internet being filled with scammers and grifters who want to just steal everything for their own selfish wants. When did the internet get so bad?</p>

<p>Again, I miss the days of Geocities. The age of the 90s when the only thing crawling the internet, <em>was you</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s what’s going on here.

Most of this has to do with mental burn-out and the current political climate. The rest of it has to do with me being <em>absolutely</em> addicted to Minecraft and the little world I’ve built where I routinely solo-raid the Nether while continually building cobblestone fences around my house. But, I figured I’d write something here before I head off to work for the umpteenth time.</p>

<p>So, first things first, if you missed it, I am now a moderator over at <a href="https://labyrinth.zone">labyrinth.zone</a>, wherein I’ll be working with other moderators handling reports. I threw my hat into the ring with this instance, because it is, quite frankly, one of my favorite places to post. Why not go deeper in that involvement? Hence, here we are.</p>

<p>In other personal updates, I’ve been trying to find a solution to my want for a personal Minecraft Java server, that can be public, and also have some addons, <em>without it costing nearly 60 dollars a month</em>. And it would seem that the only current solution there would potentially be for this, would be to host the server entirely myself, on my <em>own</em> system. Which, I don’t think I’d like to do.</p>

<p>Since I currently pay Linden Labs to have my own personal homestead where I host my store, and some other little things, it wouldn’t currently make sense to suddenly erect a Minecraft server that adds on to those costs.</p>

<p>Everything costs too much in 2025.</p>

<p>In relation to my music, and the ongoing album I’ve been working on, I haven’t had much of a chance to move forward with this yet, but I think it <em>is</em> a good idea to periodically talk about how I’ve decided to drop the “PLEXX” project, and move everything back to <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Eyeshadow 2600 FM</a>. As long and as nonsense as the name is for this musical project, I decided that there’s really no reason to abandon pieces of the past, <em>just</em> because I was weird about naming things 8 years ago.</p>

<p>And, as for my book, “Dissolution Protocol,” I haven’t really made a whole lot of progress on this. In fact, as soon as “AI” became a thing, I mostly stopped progressing in writing entirely. Unless, you know, it has to do with writing on my website.</p>

<p>This is still something I’m working through, trying to grasp at reasons to continue, while there are potentially hundreds of thousands of people out there drooling over the chance to rip-off anyone and everything for their own personal gain.</p>

<p>But, that’s mostly it from me in regard to personal updates.</p>

<p>As another reminder, I’m running an old-school kind of bulletin board over at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster/" target="_blank">forum.mkultra.monster</a>, where you can sign up, drop a thread, start a conversation, and maybe even contribute to starting up a community! Go on, give it a shot. There’s no downside to setting up an account, and hey, maybe you’ll enjoy this little slice of old-net that I’m propping up for a few bucks a month on a VPS.</p>

<p>And, finally, if you know of a Minecraft Java server solution that doesn’t cost an arm, leg, and an eyeball to put up and run for fun, let me know! My comment section should be working on here, or you can just @ me at <a href="https://labyrinth.zone/daemon_nova" target="_blank">daemon_nova@labyrinth.zone</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Krafton is very open about its pro-AI advocacy – it has a whole section of its website dedicated to its Deep Learning division, which works to use generative AI to “increase game productivity” by generating art, animation, and voices, translating research into real-world tools, creating “Virtual Friends” you can play games with and talk to, virtual influencers that can livestream games, and probably more that isn’t stated on the website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Quoted from <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-inzois-use-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank">thegamer.com</a>.</em></p>

<p>Wow, that’s a lot of horrible things to shotgun all at once!</p>

<p>But, don’t worry, they’re only using things people made for free, or work that they’ve already had done for them by actual artists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All AI features within InZOI utilize proprietary models developed by Krafton and are trained using solely company-owned and copyright issue-free assets and data,” Suri explains. “In addition, inZOI’s AI capabilities are built into the client as on-device solutions and therefore do not make communications online with external servers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Quoted from <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/inzoi/generative-ai" target="_blank">pcgamesn.com.</a></em></p>

<p>As if it <em>somehow</em> makes it seem better, to announce that you’re outsourcing jobs in your company to an algorithmic machine that’s choking the atmosphere, but with things people didn’t ask for money for, or things you’ve already paid actual human beings to make.</p>

<p>Okay, I get it. I’m cynical, and sick-to-death of talking about this. But, all across social media, or, at least, <em>corporate</em> social media, there are endless people thoughtlessly Ghibli-ifying themselves, or clamoring about how great they think it is to use a hallucinating chatbot as a replacement for critical thinking, and now that same brain-drain garbage is leaking into an art form.</p>

<p>I don’t have much hope for the world. I don’t have much hope for art. I <em>lost</em> hope in most people a long time ago.</p>

<p>But, if you’re like me, and you’re sick of this trash, join my club. The Never-AI-in-My-Damn-Games club, and don’t buy this. Don’t buy anything by any developers or studios who’ve decided that having artists isn’t productive enough, or a waste of money.</p>

Not only will the console cost you 500 dollars, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank">the digital edition of games will be 80 dollars, and the physical copies wil be 90 USD</a>, on a case-by-case basis (apparently). As we all know, the last studio that did something like this, caused a cascade that made nearly <em>every new title</em> 70 bucks. But, there’s something <em>all of them</em> are ignoring.</p>

<p>It’s quickly becoming apparent that owning a PC <em>or</em> a console is something only people with extra, or <em>lots</em> of money will be doing, in the extreme near future. <em>Especially</em> if Nintendo is successful in pushing standard edition games to 80 and 90 dollars. As if we’re all made of money while the economy is tanking far past the toilet, and into hell itself.</p>

<p>But, I remember a time when I used to buy multiple games per month. Now I buy a single game every couple months, or maybe two if I’m feeling like I don’t care. Maybe more if they go on sale at steep discounts.</p>

<p>This isn’t how it used to be.</p>

<p>But, I wanted to talk less about the rising prices of games without any thought for the people who buy them (because who cares if we price out an entire class of people from an art form), and more about the <em>thing</em> that all of these studios and publishers are ignoring.</p>

<p>You can play perfectly fun, good, and highly detailed games <em>on your phone</em>, and … <em>for free</em>.</p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p>We’re no longer in the era of Candy Crush being a staple of mobile gaming.</p>

<p>You can play <em>Call of Duty</em> on your phone, without spending a single dime. Which is <em>hilarious</em>. The studio that brought you microtransaction-shooter-hell, that releases with a new title every 6 months at 70 to 100 bucks, also gave you a way to play the <em>same exact thing, for free, on your phone</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can play a game that’s basically a copy-paste of Breath of the Wild, for FREE (Genshin Impact).</p>

<p>Don’t like either of those?</p>

<p>Phones got Minecraft, also. And it’s free.</p>

<p>Or maybe you’d prefer Runescape.</p>

<p>No? How about the entire native Warframe experience?</p>

<p>Or even PUBG!</p>

<p>The thing is, I think a lot of these studios are banking on the idea that most gamers (see: people who play games) <em>don’t take phone gaming seriously</em>. But, why shouldn’t they?</p>

<p>You can whip out a cheap adapter, and plug an HDMI cable <strong>into a 200 dollar Android</strong>, and play <strong>on your TV, with a wireless controller</strong>.</p>

<p>Or, you know, you can just … hold your phone, and play while laying down, on your back, in your comfy bed, and pop off forty straight kills in a CoD team deathmatch.</p>

<p>But hey.</p>

<p><em>Hey.</em></p>

<p>Maybe you would prefer to spend 150 dollars on the next Call of Duty title for your 700 dollar console. Or your 2000 dollar PC.</p>

<p>Is it time to take mobile gaming seriously?</p>

<p>Bro, most of us are <em>already</em> taking it seriously.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="nintendo" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, just a few days ago, it was announced that the Switch 2 will be nearly 500 dollars.

That thing being, Minecraft ARGs, or “alternate reality games.” Wherein, some user will post, or say they’re “reposting” something from over a decade ago, of a strange series of videos, from a near vacant Youtube account. And then as you watch said videos, there’s a string of creepy, horrific, or sad things that happen as this “Youtuber” plays through Minecraft (and each video will usually have clues or hidden links, etc).</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “The hell? You’re almost 40, right? Minecraft is for KIDS!”</p>

<p>Maybe you’re not thinking that.</p>

<p>But, I <em>do</em> think it sometimes, to myself. Mostly, because I was an alpha-buy-in for the original Minecraft, and I have definitely noted the extreme family-friendly shift the game made over the last decade. Not that this is <em>hugely</em> a problem, or anything. I still very much enjoy logging onto my realm and figuring out how exactly to make my base not be really basic and boring.</p>

<p>Anyway!</p>

<p>There are two Minecraft ARGs that really stick out to me as extremely well done. At least, of what I’ve watched so far. But, I don’t go through the whole game of picking through videos, and figuring out what’s going on. I just watch someone do it for me.</p>

<p>But, the first one isn’t really an ARG, it’s more like a short film.</p>

<p>And it’s great.</p>

<p>This one is a dive into a short Minecraft film called “ABANDONED.” Which is in the style of something of a “let’s play” sort of deal, except the player’s Minecraft world is … haunted. With commentary from the Youtube channel, trone(y)sauce (because this is how <em>I</em> stumbled upon it, and I didn’t really object to having commentary and a dissection of what happened).</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdV73N_PmZo?si=wlDtB5LS5znWy7d5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Now, this didn’t really scare me or anything, it was just <em>really</em> interesting to watch. Because, I’ve never seen people do things like this with Minecraft.</p>

<p>I thought it was all just semi-weird-ish adults doing exaggerated Let’s Plays for kids.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>After you’re done watching that one, you <em>absolutely have</em> to watch, “My Minecraft World is Deleting Itself …”</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5HVis7SmP4?si=HXnQhPnLnSXdKEDU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This one <em>is</em> an ARG, and I also watched it from another Youtuber’s perspective, as they themselves explain all of the details. And, this one isn’t really scary or anything either. It’s, actually, a really sad story.</p>

<p>But, I’ll let you watch it and figure out for yourself if you can come to the conclusion on what it’s about before Wifies explains it for you, at the end.</p>

<p>Again, this is content that’s just revolving around Minecraft. I would have never expected to find things like this, and I can’t wait to see if there’s anymore!</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="minecraft" /><category term="args" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In continuing my new trend of just yapping, I wanted to point out something that I’ve been kind of enjoying lately (especially since quality Backrooms Youtube content has kind of dried up for me).

They thought I was simply releasing music and ignoring everything else.</p>

<p>Well, this is on-going and continuing proof that I do buy, and also listen to music. Especially nowadays, as my album creation process is <em>much, much slower</em> than it used to be.</p>

<p>Up first! We have …</p>

<p><em>Whitewoods</em>, <a href="https://mypetflamingo.bandcamp.com/album/spaceship-earth" target="_blank">Spaceship Earth</a>. I grabbed this album, because it sounded like a mixture of new wave pop-punk and synth-y vaporwave, which, I think, is <em>exactly what it is</em>.</p>

<p>Next up is, <em>t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者 and 猫シ Corp.</em>, <a href="https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/--45" target="_blank">テ​レ​パ​シ​ー​の</a>. Which is, for all intents and purposes, a <em>much more</em> traditional type of vaporwave. You’ve gotta have the traditional type, along with its variations. At least, <em>once</em>, in your Bandcamp shopping sprees.</p>

<p>I support vaporwave a lot more nowadays, because it sounds exactly like something you might hear while you’re lost in the Complex / Backrooms.</p>

<p>Third in today’s purchases, is <em>LAST CEREMONY</em>, <a href="https://businesscasual87.bandcamp.com/album/dial-up-daydreams" target="_blank">DIAL-UP-DAYDREAMS</a>. This is some more mega-vapor tunes, with a call-back to nineties internet surfing. Basically, all you need to do in order to get me to buy your album, is to theme it around 90s internet. That’s it!</p>

<p>Fourth, is <em>glaciære</em>, with <a href="https://hiraeth-records.bandcamp.com/album/pool-water-blue" target="_blank">pool water blue</a>. A very <em>dreamy</em>, vaporwave, kind of liminal space sounding album, with definite eighties synthwave influences mixed within. Listening to this, only a few tracks in, it’s a <em>must buy</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t really buy anything that’s purely “eighties synthwave” much anymore, mostly due-in-part to the way a lot of the people in that music community treated me. But, I do still listen to and enjoy its influences.</p>

<p>And, <em>finally</em>, what would a Bandcamp shopping spree be if I didn’t buy, <em>Mabisyo</em>, with <a href="https://mabisyo.bandcamp.com/album/sun-colored-eyes" target="_blank">Sun Colored Eyes</a>. This is the second Mabisyo album I’ve grabbed, and, just like the first time, this is <em>professional grade</em> dreamy vapor-synth. And, while a lot of these albums have obvious influences from Japan, and its music (think lo-fi j-pop), this is definitely one of the most notable.</p>

<p>That’s it for now! I could probably go on an infinite shopping spree and just grab <em>every single thing</em> that catches my eye, but my bank account wouldn’t like that much. So, we’ll save the next 5 albums I buy for either my next payday, or next month. Or, maybe May’s Bandcamp Friday? We’ll see!</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Music" /><category term="music" /><category term="albums" /><category term="bandcamp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I decided I wanted to write about albums I buy on Bandcamp, partly because when I was still being extremely, over-the-top prolific about making music back on Twitter (before the twitter-synthwave community effectively excommunicated me due to a large portion of them being extremely bigoted), some didn’t think I was buying any music.

If you’ve been following my little journey in hollowing out a piece of the internet that isn’t annoying, dominated by corporations, and their engagement tricks, you’ve likely seen me popping up this website, erecting a phpBB forum, and you’ve probably also noticed that people all over the place are making GeoCities-ish type websites for fun! Well, the revival of the old-net goes even deeper than that.</p>

<p>Ever since Meta turned on Facebook, things have gotten worse, and worse. MySpace got sold off and changed into something completely different (a janky website for bands???). AOL Instant Messenger went offline, <em>for good</em>. Twitter plopped into the ether, Tumblr became a replacement for LiveJournal, and then for a decade everyone only visited four websites.</p>

<p>That was … until people got tired of the algorithms, and the disingenuous content of people and corps who use social media to pump stats and shun actual social interaction.</p>

<p>Out came Mastodon on the ActivityPub network, and, although ActivityPub existed for <em>a long time</em> before Mastodon’s rise, I feel like <em>this</em> is exactly where people started rebuilding, for <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>You see, the internet is a lot like space. You can build a wall. You can put up a ton of interstellar checkpoints that flash a million ads in your face as you navigate around each system. But, as soon as people realize that space is not a two dimensional plane, and that they can just, fly in a different direction, things start to change.</p>

<p>AOL Instant Messenger, reborn!</p>

<p>Exactly a year ago today, the <a href="https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server" target="_blank">Retro AIM Server</a> repo appeared on Github. A project that effectively open sourced the AOL Instant Messenger servers. In that, <em>you</em>, or <em>anyone</em>, can just host a server that people can use the <em>actual</em> old software to connect to.</p>

<p>But you don’t need to do all of that.</p>

<p>All you need to do is use the links in the repo to download AIM to your system of choice. I’m on Linux, so I had to use Wine to open it. No biggie.</p>

<p>Then, you need a server, right?</p>

<p>I gotchu.</p>

<p>All you’ve got to do is <a href="https://sso.chivanet.org" target="_blank">go here</a>, and create an account. Then, in the AIM section, create your username and password.</p>

<p>You’re done!</p>

<p>Open the original AIM client, follow the instructions from the repo that tell you where to put your connection info, and sign on!</p>

<p>You’re back, or, if you were born in the 2000s, you’re here for the first time!</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> issue, is this is not something that’s on a billion person network. So … having buddies will not be something you … <em>have</em>, right away. But, that’s okay, because you can have me as your first buddy. My AIM name is Atomleiche.</p>

<p>Just click the “+/- setup” button on the bottom right, then click “add buddy” and type in my username. Then confirm it. If I’m online, you’ll hear the sound of a door opening, and then you can just double-click me and send a message!</p>

<p>It’s that simple!</p>

<p>And this is how it worked back on the old-net. You added buddies, and then when they came online, it was time chat. Or not! Some people would just add me back in the day to expand their list, I think. Who knows. But I had a whole lot of buddies, who I’m sure have completely different lives now. Maybe none of them think about this stuff anymore. Maybe they do!</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>But, I feel like this is still only the beginning.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="internet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Queue Inception bwam sound.

Not because there’s <em>nothing</em> to write about, but more-so that everything I <em>could</em> write about is mostly negative. Negative, like me visiting the forum I’ve endorsed over and over again (Melonland), and speaking out against the pro-AI users and their bad ideas, and then subsequently being moderated by <em>Melooon themselves</em>, is … discouraging, to say the least.</p>

<p>Read more on that, <a href="https://labyrinth.zone/notice/AsSifF0crLJyf1gsbI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve since, unfortunately, scrubbed all mention of Melonland from this website. Not going to support someone (and their projects) who thinks it’s bad form to say, “These people should be mocked and shunned.”</p>

<p>And then I go on Bluesky, and it’s just a continual waterfall of “Laurelai Bailey this, Laurelai Bailey that,” as it goes, because she keeps gaining influence on every new platform that crops up, and apparently there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Due-in-part to the fact that the newest generation of trans people <em>have no idea who she is</em>, or any idea at all about the numerous crimes she’s committed, starting from sexual assault, years-long efforts in gaslighting and manipulating people, all the way up to divulging information to the FBI, and working hand-in-hand with admitted neo nazis, and sexual predators.</p>

<p>But, instead of deep-diving into either of these topics, I just want to summarize the last three days, before I’m shoved back into offline work, and my time is taken up by all of that, plus sleeping and being exhausted for the following next three days.</p>

<p>So, as you know, I’ve launched a forum over at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">forums.mkultra.monster</a>. And there are many potential topics to engage in. I’ll be subsequently adding different things to the forum, as I write, and do <em>stuff</em>, as a way to document and archive <em>what</em> I’m doing, and also to encourage users to join, and start up a conversation.</p>

<p>This <em>may</em> be the hard part, but I’m mostly happy that I finally decided to <em>just make the forum</em> I’ve been wanting to make, whether people will use it or not.</p>

<p>I also took a whole bunch of painstaking hours, and added custom thumbnail images <em>to every single</em> forum, so that each has their own little dash of flavor.</p>

<p>The only issue I’m working through now, is that e-mail authentication and sending for accounts, <em>does not work at all</em>. I’ve tried using SendGrid’s SMTP credentials, and even Google’s SMTP credentials.</p>

<p>So far, this has resulted in … <em>Nothing</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you don’t <em>need</em> e-mail authentication to sign up, but, you <em>will</em> need to remember your password, since the only way to recover it is via e-mail. Which currently does not work.</p>

<p>I’ll be investigating via the official PHPBB forums to figure out why this is the one pain-point of putting together a forum.</p>

<p>Otherwise … that’s basically it! That’s how I’ve spent the past three days!</p>

<p>And, continual negative stuff aside, I hope that I’m able to continue building from here, in my quest to bring back and isolate parts of nineties internet culture that were thought to be dead long ago.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Updates" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="updates" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m at this point again, where, I’m having trouble thinking of things I want to write about.
