Destroyed, as in, as soon as you launch it, it closes itself. But, there’s a work-around …</p>

<p>The issue, is that, apparently, in the latest update a few days ago, due to <a href="https://jira.firestormviewer.org/browse/FIRE-34877" target="_blank">recent changes with regard to Mesa drivers</a>, Firestorm no longer works. There <em>is</em> a fix on the way, but, as we know, these fixes could take … any infinitely guessable amount of time to hit your machine. It could be tomorrow, it could be in 3 weeks, it could be in 3 months. Who knows! I’m personally running Pop!_OS, and my Firestorm updates come, <em>sometimes</em>, weeks after they’ve been released.</p>

<p>As someone who is running multiple stores in Second Life, and has some other things I need to look after on a daily basis, this is no bueno.</p>

<p>But, also, if you’re on Linux, you might like to game? You might dabble in a little pew pew, and a little fictional love triangle? Well, do I have news for you.</p>

<p>Open up Lutris. If you don’t have it, <em>get it</em>. Use Flatseal to make sure it has access to all of your drives (just in case you don’t want to install things to your main hdd). Search for Firestorm, install that motherfreaker. Boom.</p>

<p>Launch it.</p>

<p>You’re back in Second Life.</p>

<p>For now.</p>

<p>Until the Mesa, or Firestorm devs break <em>something else</em>.</p>

<p>I figured I would share this, though, because the amount of Linux users out there are growing. Growing, as Microsoft continues to transform Windows into a vehicle for malware and spam.</p>

<p>I was willing to give up Call of Duty to use Linux, due to their kernel level anti-cheat, that should, frankly, be <em>illegal</em>. But Second Life is <em>essential</em>, and I refuse to reinstall Windows for <strong>one damn program or game</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="secondlife" /><category term="firestorm" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re like me, and you abandoned Windows quite a while ago, or maybe even recently, and you use the Firestorm viewer for Second Life (yes, this is probably an extreme niche of a niche of people), you’ve likely noticed that the latest update to the Firestorm flatpak has destroyed Firestorm.

And the same is true for the social media app that calls itself “decentralized” while not being decentralized whatsoever.</p>

<p>Giving users keys they can host on a VPS that open up a connection to your server farm is not what decentralization is.</p>

<p>But anyway …</p>

<p>Over the past week, Bluesky has managed to utterly destroy user trust in a period of time that’s even faster than Mozilla’s destruction of trust. A week ago, people were praising Bluesky as a safe alternative to Twitter that won’t host or embolden neo nazis. Now, bsky has become a haven for Jesse Singal, a dangerous troll who has lawyers.</p>

<p>Lawyers who are apparently requesting private information of users from Bluesky, and are being obliged???</p>

<p>This is what we call a Guinness Book of World Records attempt at enshitification.</p>

<p>I tried to find the official stance on all this, though, but it seems sources directly <em>from</em> Bluesky devs / moderators have either been deleted, or hidden. So, a lot of this probably sounds like hearsay, and the only thing I can really show is <a href="https://hexbear.net/post/4100941" target="_blank">this post from hexbear</a>.</p>

<p>But, <em>if this is true even in the slightest</em>, you should leave Bluesky, immediately.</p>

<p>You should leave Bluesky, and just … find a decent Mastodon instance. Which isn’t hard. I’ve written so many little guides on how to determine if an instance is good or bad, and I really have to reiterate, that while ActivityPub has its issues, it definitely doesn’t have a problem with moderation (as long as you don’t join a lawless instance, and I have to repeat, do not do that). Largely, because moderation issues are in the hands of the users, entirely.</p>

<p>I own my own server, I host and run it myself, and I completely ban anything I want!</p>

<p>No waiting for a trust and safety team to tell me all the reasons why they can’t do anything. Just one click of a button, and the shit’s gone, bro.</p>

<p>And that’s how <em>all</em> instances technically work!</p>

<p>Now, I know not everyone in the world reads this blog, so these things I keep saying for sure aren’t reaching masses of people. But I post these things so that maybe they’ll be found in the future when people are looking for answers, or alternatives.</p>

<p>And I realize that some may return to Twitter, some may jump over to Threads, or <em>return</em> to Threads, and ActivityPub <em>may</em> experience another influx.</p>

<p>But if you were thinking, “Huh, Bluesky?

That the team behind the app sort of leaves it <em>mostly</em> in the hands of the users to construct block and mute lists (which comes with accountability issues all on its own). But, one would only have to take a gander at the <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=jesse+singal" target="_blank">current Bluesky search results for Jesse Singal’s account</a> on the app, to see where some of this frustration might be coming from.</p>

<p>So, in response, I offer the alternative of Mastodon / ActivityPub again! Despite the random negative-posting I’ve seen on Bluesky <em>about</em> Mastodon (people don’t like aspects of the UI and join process), I really think people should check it out. Do some research. Find a community that <em>has</em> rules and guidelines. If you do this, I think you’ll be just fine.</p>

<p>Do you know how much bigotry and toxicity I see on my own instance?</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because I ban every single thing that even so much as slightly annoys me (ban, as in suspending from federation, i.e., making them invisible to my entire server).</p>

<p>If you’d like to give it a try, I have open registration on my instance at <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a>, and while I can’t sustain thousands of people, I can at least take in <em>some</em>. For MKMO, you only need provide a clear reason why you want to join (this is to weed out trolls), and give me some time to approve your account.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there are <em>plenty</em> other instances to look at, too. I suggest giving my page on <a class="page-link" href="/pages/activitypub">ActivityPub</a> a look, and then also the <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net" target="_blank">Join the Fediverse</a> website.</p>

<p>That’s all for now! I have to get ready for work soon, but I wanted to put this out there for those who may be interested in a <em>real</em> alternative to corporate-controlled, poorly moderated social media.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m seeing murmurs that people, at least some people, are becoming fed up with the low amount to entire lack of moderation on Bluesky.

Influencers on social media flaunting expensive cars, designer clothing, big houses (so you wanna be a rock superstar), and then, of course, the extremely lucky Youtubers, TikTokers, and so on and so forth, who make it big because they hit the algorithm correctly. But, in all reality, this is a small amount of people who do these things. Becoming rich and famous is not something the average person, or most people, will ever attain. It’s like they say, you have more in common with a homeless person, than a billionaire.</p>

<p>And that’s true.</p>

<p>I’ve been “making content,” all sorts of things, for as long as I can remember now. I hit it very minimally “big” in 2022 with some NFT project I was drawing by hand, and then I lost all of it within 6 months. Albeit, it was only 10,000 dollars, and I was able to buy things I didn’t have, that I needed. But, like life does, as soon as good things happen, bad things follow. And all of that money was gone in seconds. And now I’m in debt because of it (car repairs, sick pets, failing hardware).</p>

<p>About two years before that, I had a bestselling album in the darksynth sector of Bandcamp. Am I rich? Am I famous?</p>

<p>No, and no.</p>

<p>Shortly after having some big success in music, I was systematically removed from the synth/retro scene by bad actors who, to this day, still look to control this tiny niche of a music scene. However they see fit, to whatever ends they decide. It’s a copy, a carbon copy, of the real, actual music scene. And it blows nuts, and tons of ass.</p>

<p>I’ve been running a Patreon since 2012, and recently shifted over to Ko-fi and Liberapay. I’ve been working on a new album, a book, tons of Python scripts to make my website cooler, and my Mastodon instance more dynamic and interesting. I’ve been writing, <em>forever</em>, doing web design <em>even longer</em>. And I’m just about as broke as I was a decade ago. Just, now I have more bills, and a full time job that hardly pays for it all.</p>

<p>I live paycheck to paycheck, and I’ve been paying on debt for almost three years that never seems to go away. And soon, soon! I’ll have education expenses coming my way, as the buffer period starts to run out, and I start owing on classes for a major I didn’t even finish (computer science, physics, front-end development).</p>

<p>And I have an inkling of a suspicion that this is how a lot of people are living. A lot of people in this country owe a billion companies a ton of money, and at the end of the month they’re, like me, probably left with mostly peanuts to push around so that they can do things that bring them some kind of joy.</p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, you should keep making things. Keep making silly little videos, keep drawing, keep making music, keep writing, keep creating. But don’t do it in the pursuit of extreme amounts of money and fame. The only people in the world who are rich beyond their wildest dreams were either lucky, or perpetuators of mass amounts of exploitation and pain.</p>

<p>Sure! Maybe one of the people reading this will get lucky, and you’ll have your wildest dreams come true, but for most of us? The life you’re living now is probably the way it’s going to be for a long time, if not, <em>for the rest of your life.</em> And that’s okay.</p>

<p>It’s not the luck that’s letting you down, it’s the <em>system</em>.</p>

<p>If every single person were rich and thriving, <em>nobody</em> would be. Being rich depends on other people being poor. And that’s why everything is so beyond screwed up, in 2024. A system that demands <em>some</em> people suffer, so that others can live in permanent comfort, <em>frickking sucks ass</em>, by design. And it’s not your fault!</p>

<p>So buy that Mocha Cappuccino, and subscribe to Max and watch Lord of the Dragons or whatever, and write that book, and then post it online so some soulless algorithm can copy and paste it into an uninspired jerkwad’s publishing machine. Wander around in Second Life and pretend you own a home, and then start a band. Play some music, make 40 albums, move to New York, and–</p>

<p>You know what, just do you.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="rich" /><category term="famous" /><category term="not" /><category term="gonna" /><category term="happen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, there’s been a growing epidemic of excess.

I haven’t done so, mostly, because a lot has been going on in the world, and my head is spinning! In my personal life, I’m moving positions at work, so there’s a stressor, but not <em>too stressy</em>, because it’s a position I’m familiar with. And then in the real world, BAM. A health insurance CEO gets murked, and then there’s a multi-day manhunt, and it ends … with bro eating a burger at McDonalds?</p>

<p>I’m sure by now the whole entire internet has heard about the UHC assassination, and I’m also sure almost the entire internet <em>didn’t give a flying fart</em> that some billionaire who has caused the deaths of thousands (maybe even millions??) was killed. A life for many lives, seems fair? But then the shooter, whoms’t we’ll just call Luigi, since he’s been picked up by the cops … jumps on a bike, dumps a backpack, and then 3 days later emerges in Pennsylvania for a burger. At which point an elderly employee snitches on him.</p>

<p>Then the whirlwind comes out, and <a href="https://x.com/PepMangione" target="_blank">his Twitter</a> is unearthed, and his political leanings are as confusing as wrapping your head around how someone who was so careful from the start, ended up at McDonalds with all of the evidence the cops would need to arrest him. (/me breathes out) But, maybe he planned it that way? You know? Your face is on security cameras flirting with someone at a hostel (they have hostels in New York? They don’t just call them shared motels? The heck?), and maybe you figure, “Damn, uh, I am probably going to get caught, huh.”</p>

<p>And then he flips a switch and his Youtube starts uploading videos. The first one comes and it says something about how everything’s planned, and more is coming … “soon.” And then there’s a quick flash of the date, “December 11th.”</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/uhc/soon.png" /></p>

<p>A couple of hours later, another video premiere begins on a 45 minute timer, and this is all you see …</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/uhc/binary.png" /></p>

<p>For those who don’t know, or don’t want to decipher it, this is binary code that reads, “The Truth will set me free.”</p>

<p>About 20 minutes into the timer, Google / Youtube stepped in and deleted the entire channel. Although, I seriously <em>doubt</em> the content he had scheduled was deleted. I’m <em>sure</em> that’s on a Google server waiting to be sent to the police in Altoona or New York (whichever). But … that’ll be interesting to see, if <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>Now, there are <em>other</em> things, like his praise of the Unabomber on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4065667863" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> where he <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/10j1le5/comment/j5i4x9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">quotes a Reddit user</a> in his thoughts on the book, and the world, in-general. And an apparent Instagram account, which … I won’t even <em>try</em> to find, as people flock to the site making new accounts under the man’s name in a vapid, shallow attempt at getting a ton of followers really quick before the story dies down (frikken opportunists).</p>

<p>I think it all brings together a rightful distaste for corporate America, and how our society is run. In that, <em>it sucks a whole lot of ass, and it ain’t getting any better.</em> But, if you were hoping his politics would be pure, so that it would be easier for you to excuse him: Good luck.

I’m mostly doing this because I’ve allowed some of my bills to get out of control, and I’m paying for things I really don’t need to be. After using Neocities for a <em>long time</em>, I’ve found the social aspect isn’t really … worth it. People don’t really pay any attention to website feeds on there.

<p>So, I figured, “Why don’t I just keep this on Github and stop having my website in two separate places???” And hence, I did.</p>

<p>But, I’m mostly writing this post right now to see if my “post to mastodon” script works, <em>without</em> the deploy-to-neocities step in the workflow (which it should). I’ll only know though, once I hit that commit button.</p>

I think, or I’m pretty <em>sure</em> that’s when I first joined Mastodon. It was back on my mastodon.social days, because, well, I’m not sure there were as many privately run instances, and this was before I launched a GNU Social instance (wish I would’ve found a way to keep it, would be awesome to still have it). But one of the first things that caught my attention wasn’t really the UI, or the diversity of people and ideas on my timeline as I gradually followed those I was interested in seeing. It was, in fact, the federated timeline that kept me captivated.</p>

<p>You can see this, now, on pretty much <em>all</em> ActivityPub software (aside from like Pixelfed, I think?), but to me, when I first saw it, it was like the first time I played an MMO. It was mesmerizing. I came from Twitter where what I saw were random people that an algorithm decided to feed to me. Usually, it was <em>always</em> some junk meant to make you mad, to get you angry, so that you’d engage, and keep you on their site longer, and longer (and it worked, for a long time). But, seeing <em>all</em> of the people an instance was connected to, across probably <em>all of the instances that existed at the time</em>, was freakin’ wild.</p>

<p>This was back when I was still out-of-work and suffering from some <em>major</em> anxiety and agoraphobia issues, so I had some time on my hands.</p>

<p>I think, the very first time, I spent an <em>entire night</em> watching people zoom by with whatever thoughts they were shooting out into the void.</p>

<p>Like logging onto my Night Elf for the first time in 2004 World of Warcraft, it was something <em>I had never seen before</em>. People, unfiltered, non-algorithmic, just living in the social media moment.</p>

<p>This isn’t something you can get on Bluesky, as much as the devs tout what their idea of “decentralization” is. Bluesky is very much just Twitter, but with a PDS that lets you store media and a handle.</p>

<p>But, on my <em>own</em> instance now (again, and self-hosted), the timeline isn’t <em>as fast</em> as it was when I was on .social in 2017, and this is largely due-in-part to the fact that I block <em>many</em> instances with negative, bad, or sometimes illegal content. The last time I saw the .social timeline, they were … let’s say, a lot more <em>lax</em> about what they allowed through the pipeline.</p>

<p>I’m not.</p>

<p>I pay for this server, and so I keep the fungal mass out.</p>

<p>If you haven’t really experienced this, I <em>highly</em> recommend you turn on the advanced web interface for Mastodon, and then watch as the thoughts stream by. Maybe you’re on a big instance and it’ll be like a waterfall, or you’re like me on a smaller instance, and it’s more like a dripfeed.</p>

<p>Whichever.</p>

<p>The thing though, <em>most</em> of the mobile apps have this too … except for the <em>official Mastodon app</em>. For real. One of the most <em>unique</em> things about ActivityPub, and it’s not included in the official app? To me, that’s kind of a fumble.</p>

<p>Why isn’t it there? Too much a chance people might see things that are bad for Apple policy? Things that could be rectified by … correctly moderating who you’re federating with?</p>

<p>Either way, that’s my piece of it. I enjoy seeing people’s thoughts stream by, even if I don’t interact with most of them, and now I have an idea for a potential <em>different</em> feature on this website (haha).</p>

<p>Good night, I’m going to turn on some ambient and zone out.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Mastodon" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the day, we’ll say 2017?

For ease of listening, ease of discovering, and ease of use, in-general. And that’s how they getcha. They make it as easy and seamless as possible, so that you’ll protest less when they announce things like, “We’re not going to pay artists anymore.” (<a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/confirmed-next-year-tracks-on-spotify-1000-plays/" target="_blank">since November 2023</a>) And maybe this doesn’t mean much for artists who make new music, and then upload to streaming, and then receive billions of streams with little effort … but it’s important to <em>everyone else</em>.</p>

<p>I’m intentionally writing this on <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Bandcamp Friday</a>, because a single sale on Bandcamp is equal to something like <em>three years of streaming</em> an artist’s work on Spotify. <strong><em>Three years</em></strong>. I’m not trying to lend any weight to Metallica of the early 00s who rallied against Napster due to them believing that a downloaded album is a loss of payment, because <em>it’s not</em> (if someone can’t or doesn’t plan to buy your music, and pirates it instead, it’s obviously not a lost sale). But, when you can, and <em>if</em> you can, you <em>should buy the music that you enjoy</em>.</p>

<p>On top of that, <a href="https://www.mountbonnell.info/joes-austin/joe-rogan-secures-multiyear-deal-to-continue-exclusive-spotify-partnership" target="_blank">Spotify and Joe Rogan</a> have an exclusive streaming deal that goes on through 2025, and if you’ve been alive and awake for the past seven or eight years, you already know why Joe Rogan is a guy who sucks and is a pile of garbage.</p>

<p>But maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, in this new era, we can convince ourselves that just because something is easy, or just because it’s something billions of people do, doesn’t mean it’s something <em>we have to do</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re an Apple fan, <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a> pays all artists, regardless of amount of streams, and I believe <a href="https://tidal.com/" target="_blank">Tidal</a> and even <a href="https://music.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube Music</a> does, as well!</p>

<p>I’m personally a fan of Apple Music, but mainly because all of my devices <em>are from Apple</em>, except for my Linux PC, and Dell laptop that I’ve got Debian 12 running on. And Apple also does another thing that makes total sense, and <em>separates</em> Podcasts in a different app, so that you aren’t shuffling around music and podcasts at the same time (yes, I’ve used Spotify and felt really cumbersome tapping around both types of media). But, you don’t <em>have</em> to use Apple stuff, you can just use one of the other ones I mentioned, … even though Google isn’t exactly a great company anymore, either.</p>

<p>Regardless, buy the music you like, stop using farking Spotify, for the love of garsh, and support artists in your day-to-day life. Make it something like … a 2025 resolution.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Spotify" /><category term="spotify" /><category term="wrapped" /><category term="music" /><category term="streaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no secret that people love Spotify.
