Many stay in their homes idling by themselves, or atop “platforms” 3000 meters up in the air, only socializing with one or two people they know personally. The virtual world has never been more disconnected as a social platform, for reasons … uh, that I’m not quite sure of. But, no need to fear! Linden Labs is alpha testing an AI character creator so that your friends can be as fake as your imagination!</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/sl-ai/creator.png" /></p>

<p>Pictured in the screenshot is a dialogue that says, “Your own personal bot intended to accompany you as you explore the world, bond with you, and interact mostly or only with you.” Because, it’s not like Second Life was, and has always been, a 3D virtual chat application. A place where you’re supposed to meet people, form friendships, and build together. <em>No, absolutely not.</em> This is a single-player virtual world, where the bonds you form are as contrived, meaningless, and embarrassing as asking Google’s Gemini if it loves you.</p>

<p>Introduced by Darcy Linden via an <a href="https://community.secondlife.com/blogs/entry/15954-introducing-the-character-designer-alpha/" target="_blank">official blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Developed in collaboration with Convai, the Character Designer empowers you to craft, customize, and animate virtual characters within Second Life. This tool is intended for developers, community builders, roleplay enthusiasts, and anyone looking to enhance their inworld experiences through dynamic characters. 
</blockquote>

<p>Roleplay enthusiasts! Now you don’t have to stand around in a group of five people in a city crafted by the hands of creators, writing ten paragraph long scenes for each other to immerse yourselves within while you create stories. Now, you’ll be able to replace all of those people and unique moments with plagiarism bots! <strong><em>OH BOY</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Just like with any other company that has suddenly decided to force AI into their products, we can only assume that this is happening because the CEO behind Linden Labs has demanded it. And, also, in every circumstance that this has happened within in the past year, I’ll ask the same question: Can we fire whoever’s responsible for this? Before it becomes the nail in the coffin that completely ruins what has been a place of discovery and friendship for <em>decades</em>?</p>

<p>Linden Labs: You want to bolster the community, reinvigorate the userbase? Take notes from VR Chat. Make creation and building <em>easier</em>. Realize that not <em>everything</em> should require a user whip out their wallet, and give new users <em>something actually cool</em>. Lower the cost of hosting your own server from 250 USD per month, to something more within the realm of sanity, at, say, 14.99 a month.</p>

<p>Or, go the desperate CEO route, and inject generative slop into Second Life. Watch it finally die, so that every person on Reddit who asks, “Isn’t Second Life dead?” can finally be correct.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second-Life" /><category term="secondlife" /><category term="ai" /><category term="lindenlabs" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve spent any time in Second Life over the course of the last decade or so, you’ve probably definitely noticed that more and more people are agoraphobic.

<p>I have a complicated relationship with Meta. Like I spoke about before, in a previous post, I’ve had a Facebook account since it was brand new, and even if I were to delete it, <em>they have everything about me, ever, and they’ll likely never relinquish that information.</em> And, at the same time, I do tend to enjoy some mindless scrolling on Reels, or pretending that I’m a regular normal social media user on Threads, as I watch Zuck make the worst decisions possible to impress people who he has imagined in his own mind. And yes, I own a Meta Quest 2, which has been gathering dust in a drawer for about three months (VR Chat has slipped out of my zone of interest).</p>

<p>This also probably sounds extremely contrary, or in opposition to my hefty support of ActivityPub, and Mastodon, especially because I <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank"><em>run my own instance</em></a>. But, as a creator of <em>things</em>, and if you create things as well (art, fiction, etc), you already know, that you <em>must</em> maintain a presence in as many places as possible. It’s part of the game. And it’s a shitty game, that I do not enjoy.</p>

<p>But, to bring the topic back to the embedded Threads post, Zuckerberg imagines a social media where there are millions and billions of AI agents, i.e., fake people. To no one’s surprise, just about <em>every single person</em> learning of this news is asking, “What in the hell is this good for?”</p>

<p>Taken from an annoyingly milquetoast article over at <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meta-ai-users-facebook-instagram-1235221430/" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
 The prospect seems an unusual one for websites predicated on the idea of human-to-human interaction. While Meta’s other AI offerings, including photo-editing tools, a ChatGPT-like text bot, and forthcoming software for producing AI-generated video, have more readily obvious appeal, it’s far from certain that an Instagram or Facebook populated by virtual apparitions would prove enticing to newcomers or satisfying for long-time users. Meta revealed to FT that users have created “hundreds of thousands of characters” since AI Studio launched in July, but that most of them remain private. The company declined to comment further to Rolling Stone. 
</blockquote>

<p>The question remains: What <em>value</em> does this provide? You’re melting the ice caps in order to put fake people on social media, that you’re <em>already aware people don’t like</em>, for <strong>what reason</strong>? Are you going to sell people AI blocking software as a solution to a problem that you yourselves have created? Is that the end goal here?</p>

<p>You see, I come from the 90s. And in the 90s, we had very, <em>very</em> primitive chatbots. Chatbots that responded to trigger words with predefined text. This is something that you can now build by yourself with like 5 minutes of Python. Hardly anyone thought it was cool then, and it definitely isn’t cool now.</p>

<p>It’s not cool, because <em>most people</em> are online and on social media, to meet, and talk to <em>real</em> people. To make friends. To make connections. <em>What</em> connection are you making with an AI ghost on Facebook?</p>

<p>Am I missing a piece of the human genome that makes something like this exciting?</p>

<p>I must be.</p>

<p>You can go and see one of these “characters” on Facebook, now. And, if you’re feeling extra funny, you can use Facebook’s <em>own reporting tools</em> to report the entire account for being a <strong>fake person</strong>. It’s literally there, in the reporting dialogue.</p>

<p>This is, at least, a great reason to entice regular people to <em>finally</em>, <em>please</em> for the love of god, <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net/?lang=en-us" target="_blank">join a fediverse instance</a>. If we can move the digital world to ActivityPub, on user-owned servers, then maybe artists, and writers, and musicians can feel like they don’t have to be on these data farms anymore, just to gamble and get a 10% boost in exposure while bots are scraping everything they say so that AI generated Jimmy Carter can say, “Hey John, did you buy that Apple Watch you were talking about yesterday?”</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="tech" /><category term="meta" /><category term="ai" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all recently come to the conclusion that billionaires and CEOs don’t really care what you think of them, or what they do.

And, keeping within the theme of traveling back in time to the world of Tumblr fandoms and Gamergate, it’s time we switched gears to the once growing “trans exclusionary radical feminist” movement, and the spectrum of hate and transphobia that came with it. Today, we’re talking about a book that was published in 2014, called <em>Adam</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bechdel/adam.jpg" /></p>

<p>The synopsis is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
When Adam Freedman — a skinny, awkward, inexperienced teenager from Piedmont, California — goes to stay with his older sister Casey in New York City, he is hopeful that his life is about to change. And it sure does.<br /><br />

It is the summer of 2006. Gay marriage and transgender rights are in the air, and Casey has thrust herself into a wild lesbian subculture. Soon Adam is tagging along to underground clubs, where there are hot older women everywhere he turns. It takes some time for him to realize that many in this new crowd assume he is trans—a boy who was born a girl. Why else would this baby-faced guy always be around?<br /><br />

Then Adam meets Gillian, the girl of his dreams — but she couldn’t possibly be interested in him. Unless passing as a trans guy might actually work in his favor . . .<br /><br />

Ariel Schrag’s scathingly funny and poignant debut novel puts a fresh spin on questions of love, attraction, self-definition, and what it takes to be at home in your own skin.
</blockquote>

<p>This had a movie accompanying it that released in 2019, wherein the <em>extremely flawed</em> premise of a guy pretending to be trans in order to sleep with a lesbian caught fire like a volcano on Twitter (and you may also note, the premise describes Adam as a <em>teenager</em>).</p>

<p>And then it was summarily forgotten in about a week.</p>

<p>These themes and premises <em>also</em> align with things TERFs believe, or talk about. But, it’s been so long since these types have really seen the light of day, at least, in the way they <em>did</em> back in 2014 across the earlier versions of the sites we’re all stuck on (well, maybe not stuck). You can read more about who they are and what they believe, <a href="https://nwlc.org/happy-pride-dont-be-a-terf/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>And, <em>maybe</em> this book isn’t exclusively anything to <em>do</em> with trans exclusionary radfems, but it’s definitely in the spaces of something that sits in the same arena as, “men wearing dresses pretending to be women entering spaces where they don’t belong,” except, in this instance, the role is reversed. The role is reversed, and it places transgender men in a light wherein they <em>have something in common with lesbians</em>, therein aligning them as <em>women who look and act like men.</em></p>

<p>Obviously, this isn’t <em>good</em>, or excusable, to write a story where something like this is painted as fun, uplifting, and “liberating.” Transphobia is literally the gasoline that’s fueling the modern fascist movement. And pretending that trans men are just women, whom’st lesbians can be interested in, romantically and sexually involved with, <em>is both transphobic and homophobic.</em> At least … if you actually align yourself with transgender people, in that they are who they say they are.</p>

<p>Now, stay with me here, what’s that quote at the top of the book’s cover read? Did you see that?</p>

<blockquote>
"The sexual revolution is finally over, and Ariel Schrag has won." - Alison Bechdel
</blockquote>

<p>Who’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel" target="_blank">Alison Bechdel</a>, though?</p>

<p>During the emergence of Gamergate, there was also a lot of talk about representation in gaming and other media, specifically about how women are represented and written. In that, they’re usually written <em>badly</em>, and usually to the benefit of a male character, for the male reader’s personal sexual “gaze” or enjoyment.</p>

<p>If you’re an older netizen like myself, you may remember Anita Sarkeesian and the extreme amount of vitriol she faced <em>whenever she talked about these things</em>, usually, specifically, in relation to gaming. You may also remember Zoe Quinn, whom is thought to be where, why, and <em>how</em> Gamergate “started,” i.e., in backlash <em>against her.</em> You can read much more about all of that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/09/24/349835297/-gamergate-controversy-fuels-debate-on-women-and-video-games" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>But then, there also emerged a guideline of sorts that served and <em>still serves</em> as a litmus test for gauging old, new, and upcoming media for their literacy in representing women.</p>

<p>This test is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" target="_blank">The Bechdel Test</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
The Bechdel test (/ˈbɛkdəl/ BEK-dəl),[1] also known as the Bechdel-Wallace test, is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The test asks whether a work features at least two female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. Some versions of the test also require that those two female characters have names.
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I’m not saying this “test” of sorts doesn’t have any merit. There is <em>a lot</em> of merit in gauging these things, and determining if media is <em>actually good</em>, especially in this day and age, where Bad Things are getting <em>more bad</em>. But, I can’t quite put my finger on why someone who gave such an endorsement, to such a terrible piece of media, that <em>absolutely betrays her own test</em>, women, and the entire trans community, and was so proud of it, that it was <strong>featured on the front of the book</strong> … is still being celebrated.</p>

<p>And I wanted to <em>finally</em> bring a more permanent light to this, because I’ve been talking about it <em>for a decade</em>, to an internet that forgets everything it thinks it cares about faster than the speed of light, and I’ve been doing that on social media websites like, Twitter, Bluesky, Tumblr, <em>all this time</em>. And, whether you think I belong to any community or not doesn’t matter. It matters that critical thinking doesn’t die, and it matters more that we consider those we’re promoting and uplifting.</p>

<p>Alison Bechdel isn’t special. She’s just as flawed as any of us, and maybe she’s not <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cathy_Brennan" target="_blank">Cathy Brennan</a>, but <em>maybe we can think of a new name for litmus testing media for actual interesting female characters</em>, that doesn’t involve the name of someone who endorsed media where a man pretends to be transgender in order to sleep with a lesbian.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="LGBTQ" /><category term="bechdel" /><category term="bechdeltest" /><category term="lgbtq" /><category term="gamergate" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago, in an age far, far away … Ten years ago, to be exact.

But I was there (and this is why I say that Twitter was <em>never actually good</em>), and I remember what the discourse and shitposting looked like.

<p>First, we have The Witcher 4, where Ciri will be taking up the lead role.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/gamergate/ciri.jpg" /></p>

<p>Pretty awesome right? The best character in The Witcher 3 is getting her own <em>game</em>? Frick yeah, bro!</p>

<p>But, this is, apparently, a problem now?</p>

<p>These people don’t want to “play as a woman”, or they think Ciri looks <em>old</em> now. Honestly, I think she looks like she’s in her thirties, and that’s … uh, fine?</p>

<p>CD Project Red addressed these people, and I think even their response is a bit too tame for my liking. Quoted via <a href="https://gamerant.com/witcher-4-ciri-protagonist-concerns-complaints/" target="_blank">Gamerant</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Regarding those fans who simply don't want to play as a woman, the narrative director noted that the lore of The Witcher 4 will continue to follow the dark fantasy themes already present in the series. He pointed out that past games have addressed tough times for marginalized groups, such as non-humans, and said while Ciri's gender will play a factor in the story, it won't be the main focus.
</blockquote>

<p>And, in order to back up what I’m talking about, I had to go dig up an example of the bile from Twitter, because I don’t inherently save screenshots of every nasty thing I see online. But, I mean, this is what I’m talking about, that CDPR very luke-warm-ish, are addressing:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the shills are out hyping up Witcher 4. All the honest people saw they made the main character a woman who breaks lore in her new role AND who was made significantly uglier than she used to be. Both are red flags for an extremely woke game. <a href="https://t.co/tVPRkssFBT">pic.twitter.com/tVPRkssFBT</a></p>&mdash; Mr. Reality (@MrReality_sp) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrReality_sp/status/1867432878331580463?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>It’s true, some people might be uncomfortable with Geralt giving up the helm to the series, but also? This woman isn’t ugly? I mean, I would never go so far as to call <em>anyone</em> ugly, because bla bla bla, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But, if we’re talking brass tacks here: Ciri is hot, and very not “ugly.”</p>

<p>The biggest thing I’m worried about in regard to Witcher 4, is <em>whether or not it’s going to be a buggy mess on launch.</em></p>

<p>And this isn’t even <em>close</em> to the backlash Last of Us game director’s next new IP is receiving. Yes, you’ve probably heard about this already. It’s probably all over every feed you visit on a daily basis.</p>

<p>“Naughty Dog’s new game starring a woman or nonbinary person, who is bald and sips a soda, now has larger dislike ratio than Concord.”</p>

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgamingmemes2020%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0reNaWw31UYeaXSHqJkfbAFWNK2uaF94wuBHZggK2BLKGK9ps2C9ZFfyufRcSDXZRl&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" width="500" height="654" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;background-color:#fff" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>

<p>I’m a big fan of space and scifi games. Not sure I’m a fan of hack and slash as much though, <em>unless we’re talking Diablo</em>. I love Diablo.</p>

<p>But, again, the shitcourse continues. This actually took me more than <em>ten minutes to find</em>, on <strong>Twitter</strong>, which says to me that the backlash may be slightly manufactured. And this <em>isn’t even the worst thing</em> I’ve seen being said (maybe I <em>do</em> need to start saving screenshots of the nasty bile people spew about games and women within them):</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Intergalactic&#39;s lead chick looks like a recovering addict.

<p>Again, I don’t really see it. I don’t see what the issue is. You know what I see when I look at this protagonist?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/gamergate/ripley.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, <em>maybe</em> Intergalactic will just be an unfun game, or <em>maybe</em> it’ll be a new classic! I don’t know. What I <em>do</em> know, is that a character’s appearance, like, physical appearance, has never been the reason that a game has failed or succeeded.</p>

<p>Do you know why Mass Effect Andromeda bombed? It wasn’t because <a href="https://bsn.boards.net/thread/10115/facial-changes-default-annoying-incoming" target="_blank">Sara Ryder wasn’t wearing pink lipstick</a>. It wasn’t because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/61fv3x/no_spoiler_why_do_people_think_peebee_is_ugly/" target="_blank">Peebee</a> didn’t resemble Liara enough.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/gamergate/peebee.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was because <em>these same types of mother-frikkers</em> rallied against the game for having <em>very very</em> slight mentions of transgender-related themes, and some flubs in animations that somehow made it past QA. And because these types operate in crypto-fascist, hide-the-motive style of language, and posting, it was painted as an issue with the game, overall, just <em>not working and being bad in-general</em>. Some <em>even went so far</em> as to <em>edit</em> footage from the early game, before its release, in order to manipulate public perception of it.</p>

<p>You may have seen things like this on Tumblr and Twitter back in 2017 (and no, there is no way I’m going to be able to find reference for this anymore, especially since Tumblr staff <em>nuked my account</em>). Choppy cuts in video form of animations that appear to be backwards or wrong, in every cut, unless you had a good eye, and could see where images and cutscenes were being misrepresented. I’m talking intentionally slowing down silence between narrative, cutting back and forth between multiple characters in the midst of a conversation to give the appearance of amateur design.</p>

<p>I’m <em>still mad</em> about this, because it was <em>this backlash</em>, this manipulation of perception, that <em>caused</em> BioWare to abandon the game shortly after release, and <em>immediately</em> jump to work on the <em>also now abandoned</em>, Anthem.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> issue with Andromeda, was that a lot of the game’s polish was sacrificed to make pointlessly open-ended planets that were <em>far too large</em>. That’s it. It was actually an alright game, if you ignored that part.</p>

<p>But, I don’t think it’s diverse characters that are or will destroy the gaming industry. I think it’s these guys. I think the smoldering remains of gamergate, or <em>incels</em>, as most would say, are going to singlehandedly kill the entire industry. Much the same way they’ve killed Twitter, alongside their new boss, Felon Busk. We can’t just have games with women in them. We can’t just have games where making sure a chronically online right-wing extremist has masturbatory material isn’t the main goal. No.</p>

<p>Nuh uh.</p>

<p>Every game has to be fappable to people who have bad taste in beauty aesthetics, or it’s the gaming apocalypse.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="gamergate" /><category term="gamingnews" /><category term="intergalactic" /><category term="thewitcher4" /><category term="masseffectandromeda" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people weren’t around for what happened in 2014, and the “initialization” of “gamergate” that would, seemingly, never go away (see this link for more information).

Zuck is storing your info, selling it to advertisers, and using it to tailor ads to you to be ever-more invasive in your digital life. And, you know, who <em>knows</em> what else. If you’re nearing the age of 40, like me, you’ve probably <em>already</em> had a Facebook account, and can probably also remember when it first opened its doors to the masses (oh god, am I old?) But, <em>should you be there</em>? Is it too late?</p>

<p>Everyone knows I <em>love</em> Mastodon, despite the issues I’ve had with a handful of instances who have treated my presence … not so well. The open internet, tied to protocols and Linux, <em>is the future</em>. And there’s no way around that. So much so, Meta recognizes this, and is <em>still</em> actively working on its full integration of ActivityPub (even though many see it as a ploy to vacuum up the data of fediverse users).</p>

<p>Despite that, <em>many</em> instances are blocking Threads.net. My instance wasn’t, and then was, and now isn’t, again. Why?</p>

<p>I’m someone who sort of, subjects my online presence to testing new things, and then writing about it, on sort of a frequent basis. If you’re reading this, and you’ve been reading my blog for a while now, you probably remember when I jumped into Nostr for a while … and then later discovered that, despite a few cool people, it’s mostly just Bitcoin addicts, and extremists who want to say slurs, unhindered. And you also probably already know, I’ve tried Bluesky multiple times, to the tune of being harassed by jerks on multiple occasions, for seemingly <em>no reason</em>.</p>

<p>And I remain an instance admin on ActivityPub, despite its personal cost to my wallet, because I feel this is the <em>best</em> answer to my online presence … or is it?</p>

<p>I recently shared a post on Threads that currently has half a million views and 1,600 likes. That’s … <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve also been sharing my work, and then things I do, on Mastodon, for <em>months</em>, uh … <em>years</em>, actually. And, for a while, I could say that most of the support I <em>ever</em> see for any of my work, be it music, coding, or writing, has been <em>from Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>But, I can’t deny, that lately, in the past couple of months, it’s starting to look like that may no longer end up being the case. Albeit, I haven’t really shared much of my work on Threads, but if a post in support of Luigi Mangione can get half a million impressions, then <em>surely</em> I could find a way to put my next album, or book, in front of just as many eyes.</p>

<p>Which brings me to an impasse.</p>

<p>I’m very stringent about committing to Linux, committing to open source, and privacy, and <em>taking back</em> the internet. But, at exactly the same time, I want to make a future for myself that involves the extracurricular work that I do at home <em>becoming</em> my main source of income. And if I’m seeing <em>months</em> of next to <em>no</em> reaction to those things on the platform that I <em>actually</em> want to commit to, what am I supposed to think?</p>

<p>Do I just <em>really suck</em> at being interesting? Are the things I do just not interesting to the average Joe, or average Mastodon user?</p>

<p>Of course, I’m not <em>just</em> on Mastodon to share my work. I’m there to talk. connect, build, make friends. But it’s also <em>very</em> important that what I do is <em>seen</em> by people, you know? And this isn’t to say that there’s <em>no one</em> on Mastodon. There are plenty of people there. Somewhere around 15-20 million people.</p>

<p>And then <em>also</em> at the same time, that post with half the population of a town viewing it, this hasn’t really resulted in any … results? For my presence there? I don’t have half a million follows. I’m not noticing a huge uptick in traffic to my website.</p>

<p>Just now someone on Mastodon tells me, that Meta clout is more akin to gambling, than anything. And you know, that’s probably completely correct.</p>

<p>I don’t know. Maybe it’s something that I’m overthinking. Maybe <em>I should</em> walk away from Meta. But, as much as I’m capable of doing my offline job <em>now</em>, I may not always be capable, and eventually I’m going to need something else. And I really need that something else to be the things I’ve already been doing, for <em>years</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="threads" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="meta" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a lot of good arguments as to why you shouldn’t be on Threads, or any Meta-owned social media, for that matter.

Either way, corporate social media (Threads) has an algorithm, and that algorithm has decided that on Christmas Eve (Happy holidays!), that I should be shown the scum of the Earth, who believe there are people who shouldn’t be able to afford to live if they’re working one of <em>those jobs</em> (italics, if you’re reading from Mastodon). We’re talking all of the jobs where people were called Essential in 2020 while they worked through what was called a deadly virus. A virus that is, for sure, <em>still out there</em>.</p>

<p>Jobs that absolutely should have been compensated with hazard pay.</p>

<p>I’m talking restaurant jobs, service jobs, big box store jobs. Basically, anything that aids in the procurement of food and water for the rest of the population … some of which, who take this for granted, because their world doesn’t expand beyond the tip of their noses.</p>

<p>Instead of amplifying the voices of people who don’t deserve to be able to say things online, I just want to point out that the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage debate <em>has gone on for so long</em> that the <em>actual</em> living wage is more like 30+ dollars an hour in 2024 (going on 2025). Corporations have hiked prices so high, and landlords are abusing the fact that there are <em>zero consequences for their actions</em>, so much, that 15 dollars an hour, <em>now</em>, would be like making 7 dollars an hour in 2015.</p>

<p>It’s no longer adequate.</p>

<p>The idea that <em>some people</em> should live in poverty, just because the lucky few had 100,000 dollars to spend on college, or were a trust-fund baby, is horrid, and outdated, and it’s about high-time we tie the living wage to the <em>cost of living</em>, and so-called inflation (see: greedflation).</p>

<p>But even <em>if</em> every single person on Earth, alive today, went to college, became doctors, engineers, astronauts, and so on and so forth, <em>there would still need to be people serving the food you eat, and stocking the shelves</em>. Hence, <em>Essential Workers</em>.</p>

<p>You take that away, and society collapses.</p>

<p>Some joke that these jobs will be replaced by robots, and I welcome that! Displace billions of people, and see what happens next.</p>

<p>I dare you.</p>

So much so, trolls have had a laugh at my expense because of it, because, as <em>we all know</em>, Windows is totally superior, with its built-in ads, built-in AI, built-in (or soon to be) digital snoop, built-in forcing you to use Edge and making it so even if you use a different browser you have to tick a thousand boxes that say “open [file extension] in my new browser, instead.” And then there’s MacOS, which I <em>also</em> use, because I have a Macbook, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch, and the entire Homekit thing with the yellow ball that speaks words to me if I say “Hey Siri, what’s it like outside right now?” Which is fine! Because MacOS is <em>also</em> Unix.</p>

<p>It’s a purely <em>locked down</em> and extremely secure version of Unix, so-much-so that if you try and watch <em>any</em> streaming app on an external monitor through MacOS, the whole screen goes blank.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I wanted to write a plea to Apple, because they <em>definitely</em> read my blog (see: sarcasm), because, it’s almost 2025. No average person is pirating anything anymore. I’m pretty sure most gen z and alpha kids/adults have no idea what the phrase “pirating a movie” even means. <em>Nobody is recording shows and movies through a capture device on a secondary monitor</em>. So, can we please, let me watch Apple TV on my second, much larger monitor? I <em>pay you</em> to be able to watch Severance. The least you could do is <em>let me watch it on my big honkin’ monitor</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, I could turn on my Apple TV box but that takes WORK. I gotta use my CONTROLLER. I gotta switch the inputs.</p>

<p>Anyway, though, why use <em>both</em> Linux and MacOS?</p>

<p>Linux is great for pretty much a lot of things. Notice, I didn’t say <em>everything</em>. I like it for security and data ownership. I like it for all of the things I can do with it, that it absolutely won’t stop me from doing. I like it because my Linux PC is a beef-master 5000 and I can play Diablo 4 at max FPS (which is about the only game I play nowadays).</p>

<p>But, because I have all these millions of Apple devices, turning on my laptop and plugging into my larger display allows me to write while listening to my Apple music library that isn’t being displayed through a built-in web UI (I’m talking about the flatpaks via Linux). I can see all my texts coming through on my desktop, work on writing my book in the Pages app I’ve been using for over a year, and I can use Affinity!</p>

<p>I dumped Photoshop a long time ago, after they went face-first into AI, and started up with the predatory subscriptions. And Affinity is probably the <em>greatest</em> alternative.</p>

<p>But there’s no Linux port. And a dev told me directly they have <em>no plans to support Linux</em>.</p>

<p>Which is a huge bummer. In fact, it’s kind of … dumb. I almost swore off their entire software suite, because <em>you’ve already developed this software for MacOS,</em> which is a variation of UNIX!</p>

<p>Regardless …</p>

<p>If I somehow blew your mind that MacOS is in fact Unix based, and you don’t believe me, open up Terminal on your Mac. Create a simple bash script. I dunno, something that says “Hello world!” To do this, type “nano hello.sh”, and within that new file, type in “#!/bin/bash”, and then press enter. Now type “echo “Hello world!” Now, press ctrl + O, and then ctrl + X. Lastly, type in chmod +x hello.sh (or whatever you name your bash script). Now! Run it! Type in “./hello.sh”</p>

<p>And voila.</p>

<p>All of the things you just did are exactly how you’d accomplish the same thing in Linux. You probably thought, “Wait, what the heck? Nano is included in MacOS?”</p>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to the world of only Unix based machines.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Computing" /><category term="linux" /><category term="mac" /><category term="computing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a real big into Linux kinda person.

I made mistakes with my family, and things got dark for a while (they aren’t anymore). I lost my job because of harassment I had been enduring, and HR’s inability to take any action whatsoever. It transformed me into someone with crippling anxiety, and that of a person who <em>could not function</em> in public.</p>

<p>My first interactions with the trans community were on Reddit, where people posted photos of their faces and asked how well they “pass,” and people would routinely tear others down and talk about things that are either very hard to change, or can’t change at all. I had people telling me they liked my face before transition more than in the midst of it, and all of these experiences kind of setup my mindset for the following five years that went by (including the stalker I gained from the aforementioned subreddits).</p>

<p>I didn’t, and <em>never had</em> any community offline. Every trans woman I came into contact with in offline spaces ended up causing me some kind of pain, or heartbreak, for whatever reason. A girl in Philadelphia who used me for a day as a ride around town while she spouted off racist remarks about random people passing us by. A girl in West Virginia who is, coincidentally, also currently posting on Bluesky, who used me to make her ex girlfriend jealous, and then viciously abused me by pretending to attempt to take her own life over the phone, <em>to me</em>. Another who was a locksmith at the time, who I saw on and off for over a year, who ended our time together by telling me that I wasn’t “dating material.” After, again, <em>well over a year</em>.</p>

<p>I met someone I knew from Twitter for coffee, and she proceeded to never speak to me again, afterward, only because, I’m assuming, I didn’t ask to see her again.</p>

<p>And then there was the detransed person I knew from my job at the time, who was <em>one of the most horrible people</em> I’ve ever known, and had the displeasure of interacting with.</p>

<p>It’s safe to say, there’s no such thing as community offline. Or, at least, <em>there never was</em>.</p>

<p>Online, it wasn’t much better.</p>

<p>I came into contact with Laurelai Bailey, and in my extremely vulnerable state, I was manipulated, and then held emotionally and psychologically hostage for <em>years</em>, and I think this was a major contributor to my inability to ever <em>belong</em> to a community of any sort (Bailey has an extremely long paper-trail of being a social parasite online, among other things. Such as a rapist, and an FBI snitch).</p>

<p>I tried to find community on Tumblr, which didn’t happen, because Tumblr is <em>very bad</em> at actually connecting people together who have the same interests, and there were more bigots on Tumblr, than anything. I tried to find community on Twitter, and found endless toxic popularity contests and mean-girling. I tried to find community on Mastodon, and in my constant turmoil, I was banned, and then banned again (kitty.town), and then banned again (deadinsi.de), and then banned again (cybre.space)–Every single time someone decided to troll me, or attack me for my views, or how I looked, or what-have-you. I do not have good experiences with third-party fedi admins. Which is why I now run my own instance (tech bros who run instances routinely villianize those who are being attacked, rather than villainize the people <em>doing</em> the attacking).</p>

<p>I became part of the Twitter synthwave scene, and found <em>some</em> kind of community, albeit, it wasn’t a <em>trans community</em>. It was mostly men, who, years after, I realize were only tolerating my presence. Suffice to say, despite having a bestselling dark-synth album, I was ejected from that community after <em>exactly one</em> complaint against a transphobic comment, to the response of hundreds of people within Twitter-synthwave dogpiling and harassing me. I was muted and blocked by streaming radio stations, and my label (at the time), seemingly vanished from the internet completely. Then I was, again, on my own.</p>

<p>This kind of coincides, or leads up to me being banned from hackers.town on Mastodon, but that was more of the same in regards to what I’ve already mentioned: Tech bros and their sycophants, with backwards ideologies in regards to harassers and victims.</p>

<p>And you might be asking yourself at this point, “What’s this got to do with Bluesky?”</p>

<p>You see, I have to give some backstory here (and there is <em>so much more</em> to it than this), because it won’t make sense if I don’t.</p>

<p>I joined Bluesky over a year ago (as of posting this), because I finally got an invite code, and despite putting my transition on pause (which I could probably argue is more to do with severe anxiety and fear than anything else), I <em>still</em> wanted to find <strong>community</strong>. Which, at this point, I’m almost certain does not exist, <em>anywhere</em>. But, the problem with Bluesky, is that it has attracted all of the people who made Twitter shitty back in 2014: Harassers, narcissists, and self-described “mean girls.”</p>

<p>I recall a block list operator on Bluesky (who eventually got pushed off of the platform) who posted along with someone at the bsky domain “benni.gay” or something? And this Bennie, was, or <em>still is</em>, one of those strange people who not only identify with violent slurs, but regularly post them. We’re talking about “tranny” here. And me, with all of this disgusting backstory of nonstop bullshit, comes into contact with this person, and <em>of course</em> my reaction was, “Hey can you <em>not</em> do that.”</p>

<p>And, you know, since, <em>apparently</em> new-gen trans people have decided that slurs <em>aren’t</em> slurs, and I <em>still</em> get much, <em>much</em> younger trans women <em>on Bluesky</em> questioning me like, “What do you mean <strong>tranny</strong> is a slur?” I can only assume that there is an extreme lack of education in these faux online communities. But!</p>

<p>I questioned this person, and before tossing her a mute, I felt it was courtesy to at least ask or say, “Can we not post these kinds of words without a warning of some sort?”</p>

<p>You know what happened next. You already know.</p>

<p>Dogpiling, harassment, vicious narcissism, and violent denial of lived experience.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I <em>originally</em> deleted my account because of this, and joined Threads for a while, to begin normal-posting. And then, after a while, I launched my own Mastodon instance, and herein began where we are today, a year later.</p>

<p>But, you see, Bluesky has been gaining popularity, so … why not try again?</p>

<p>Oh, well, okay. So that was a bad idea.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bsky-again-times-two/ugh.png" /></p>

<p>And you can probably already guess, this lead to … harassment! Dogpiling! And eventual block-listing!</p>

<p>Maybe there’s something wrong <em>with me</em>. Maybe I’m too chill, or I give people too much benefit of the doubt. Maybe I’m emotionally non-existent, <em>because</em> of my history, and therefore can’t really see this coming anymore. Or, maybe online communities, especially and specifically those revolving around trans communities, <em>aren’t good and are very bad, actually</em>.</p>

<p>To be part of one of these communities, you have to subject yourself to bad jokes, labeling yourself with slurs that violent attackers <em>have actually used against you</em>, right before attempting to snatch you out of the driver side seat of your car (this happened, to me), and all-around act like a petulant, vapid psychopath, with no morals, or qualms with anything <em>unless it affects you directly</em>.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas, mother-freakers.</p>

<p>I stay on Mastodon, despite the numerous failures of admins across different instances, because it’s an online experience that I can <em>completely control</em>, while running my own instance, and <em>own</em> community. And even if nobody ever joins mkultra.monster, at least I can’t be ejected from my own platform for having the audacity to have feelings about things, and morals.</p>

<p>But I do think, at this point, Bluesky is beyond a failed experiment, because all it does is emulate the worst parts of Twitter, before Twitter became <em>only the worst parts</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="toxicity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t post about this when it happened, because, honestly, I’m unsure how much attention I want to give toxic people, and, after so many years of this being routine from people with Main Character Syndrome (see: narcissism) on social media, it’s tiring. But, Bluesky was an unwelcoming hellscape when it required invite codes to join, and it’s still exactly that, except now it has millions of people on it.

You’ve written like 800 babillion things on this website!” And while that <em>may</em> be true, I’ve also got three books on the burner I’ve started and never finished. My next and upcoming book, Dissolution Protocol, <em>especially</em>. Having just read over everything I’ve written for it so far, I realize I uh, didn’t get that far. And now I want to continue … but, how do you share and raise awareness around written fiction in the age of plagiarism?</p>

<p>I’m fairly confident that I can share snippets of things on Mastodon, and not worry all that much about my work being vacuumed up by a machine for use in some soulless idiot’s money-making scheme, but where else can you go? Forums are probably a no, and <a href="https://lemmy.zip/post/22031416" target="_blank">even NaNoWriMo are now AI shills</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s the <em>problem.</em> I nearly entirely gave up writing fiction, the second I found out that these machines were going online to scrape the whole internet for the sole purpose of profiting off of other people’s work. I mean, how do you respond to that, as someone who <em>makes</em> things, with <em>your own hands?</em></p>

<p>Frankly, I responded by saying, “Well screw it, I’m not doing <em>anything</em> then.”</p>

<p>But I <em>can’t</em> just do nothing.</p>

<p>It drives me mad.</p>

<p>It’s why I’ve turned this website into a machine that has like a million different functions.</p>

<p><em>I need to create</em>.</p>

<p>I guess this post is an ask to other writers who didn’t decide to give up, and keep going, even in the face of nonstop plagiarism from the likes of festering pimple, Sam Altman: What do you do? How do you share what you’re doing, or <em>writing</em>, if it’s no longer safe to post your work <em>anywhere</em>, <em>even in a finished state!</em></p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="writing" /><category term="fiction" /><category term="writer" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might be thinking, “Slow writer?
