Now that I’ve done that, it’s time to get back to work in figuring out how I can integrate my Sharkey instance into my website (such as like inserting my post feed into a side-bar, having trending topics on my side-bar, and so on).</p>

<p>What I would like to mention, since they’ve been pretty awesome since I started with them, and up until yesterday when I decided to turn off the instance: <a href="https://toot.io/mastodon_hosting.html" target="_blank">Toot.io</a></p>

<p>These guys have provided an <em>extremely</em> solid Mastodon experience for me for most of the year. Little to <em>no</em> issues, elastic search built-in, on-time updates, and <em>even when I was having some financial issues</em>, they worked with me in order to keep my instance from making me go broke in the short term.</p>

<p>I’m now currently running my own copy of Sharkey over at Elest.io, and they’ve been alright so far, but the experience is mostly <em>in my own hands</em>, since I now maintain the instance, plus the structure behind it.</p>

<p>But! If you’re interested in hosting a very simple Mastodon instance, and want <em>little</em> to fuss with, or even <em>setup</em>, I highly recommend Toot.io hosting. I even felt kind of bad turning off my Mastodon instance, <em>just because</em> they’ve been so good this whole time. But I yearned for more, and Sharkey has the more I’m looking for.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean <em>you</em> should launch your own instance of alternative ActivityPub software, though! If you’re <em>new</em> to this, and maybe don’t know how to use a command line, or a terminal, <em>absolutely</em> get yourself some managed hosting.</p>

<p>That’s it, that’s the post.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="sharkey" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I posted about launching a Sharkey instance, and liking it so much, I decided to move to it, and move off of the managed Mastodon instance I had.

I like to tinker with them. And now I have a full Sharkey instance, <em>that I can surely edit to my liking on the command line</em>.</p>

<p>But, and I mean, Mastodon is great, but! Sharkey has <em>a lot</em> more customization options, <em>a lot</em> more <em>everything</em>. And because I’m pretty much an advanced fediverse user, I figured, “Hell yeah, let’s do it.” So, I’m migrating everything to my new Sharkey instance at <a href="https://sharkey.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">sharkey.mkultra.monster</a>, and once I feel like it won’t break anything, I’ll likely be turning off the Mastodon instance. The sharkey instance is <em>also</em> cheaper, and I need to save my money.</p>

<p>I’ve also got just about <em>every single</em> script I’ve made, hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS, working correctly and posting to the new instance, <em>including</em> the auto-posting this blog does once I hit commit!</p>

<p>The only downside, is posts aren’t going to have comments until I figure out a different way to do them, and some of the elements on my sidebars here are commented out until I design a <em>different</em> way to display my presence on the fediverse.</p>

<p>All-in-all, this is <em>really</em> cool, and I’m sure I’ll spend countless hours redoing scripts to interface with Sharkey (lol oh god).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Sharkey" /><category term="sharkey" /><category term="activitypub" /><category term="socialmedia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I was messing around with a Linux VPS, like you do.

While the muse for which I use to create has been a very slow monster, I’ve started to notice that ever since I basically rebuilt my life, I haven’t really shared any of it that much. This is true for a lot of things I do, <em>except for these scripts</em> I’ve been making lately. So, let’s fix that.</p>

<p>I already have an automated account on my Mastodon instance that I use for sharing random things cycled via Python scripts on my VPS, but what if we used it to share random songs from all of my releases?</p>

<p>And that, we have done.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I <em>can’t</em> use Bandcamp. Because Bandcamp won’t let you scrape artist pages with a script, and if you’re going to use a browser in headless mode to achieve the same thing (and make it work), you need the server where you’re running that script to <em>actually allow you to do that</em>.</p>

<p>… which I cannot do at Digital Ocean (the chromium driver needed to do this is either inaccessible, or non-existent).</p>

<p>So!</p>

<p>Even though I absolutely <em>do not use</em> Spotify, due to their negligence of artists, and <em>paying them</em>, it is <em>at least</em> a public app that can be accessed and even listened to by pretty much anyone. As much as I prefer Apple Music, that random people can’t really just open a link and listen, is kind of an issue. And, I also am not sure if Apple Music has a readily available API.</p>

<p>Which Spotify does.</p>

<p>So, the app that hates the artists that make it the revenue it needs to continue operating, is unfortunately the avenue we’re going to take, until there’s something better.</p>

<p>And, voila.</p>

But, that aside, from within my feed, I’m watching and seeing reports of <em>constant</em> troll attacks, some stating, “Yeah, I don’t like it here actually.” So, let’s talk about Mastodon, again, maybe?</p>

<p>Over the past week or so, I’ve seen posts from people talking about, and have experienced <em>personally</em>, Kiwifarms trolls following people in some inane scare tactic. If you don’t know what KF is, it’s an extremely niche stalker website full of pyschopaths whose only hobbies are documenting and stalking people online, with mostly fabricated information.</p>

<p>It’s been giving people a bit of a sour taste in their mouths in regards to sticking to this, <em>basically</em>, brand new platform.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, it seems <em>now</em>, as of today, that trolls are going around sending users <em>extremely graphic</em> and violent images of death.</p>

<p>I want to note, that Mastodon <em>is not perfect</em> by any stretch. But this is where true decentralization comes in, and saves the day.</p>

<p>If you’re on a community run instance on Mastodon (or other <a class="pages-link" href="/pages/activitypub">AcitivityPub</a> software), or <em>your own</em>, you don’t have to put up with this kind of behavior. You don’t have to play whack-a-mole with every new account that pops up. You can just … <em>block out the instance that is acting as the source of this behavior</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, Mastodon <em>does</em> have its own issues. There are <em>a lot</em> of basic FOSS guys, and do they <em>love</em> to either give you bad advice, unprompted advice, or scold you for doing things <em>your way</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bskyagain/some-dude.png" /></p>

<p>I’m showing you this, in order to be fully transparent about what you <em>may</em> encounter on Mastodon, and how we would deal with this. For context, I have Python scripts running on a VPS, and one of them sends random images from top posts across different subreddits, to Mastodon. Some of them are NSFW, some of them <em>aren’t</em>. Either way, I <em>also</em> have it tagging each post with hashtags I wanted to have on it, like #python (because it’s running on python!)</p>

<p>This isn’t favorable to some. Simply using your mute button isn’t enough. Some people have to <em>tell you</em> that they don’t like that you’re using your software, your instance, and your social media to do whatever you want, your own way.</p>

<p>And that’s fine!</p>

<p>We can send him into the ether, never to be heard from again. <em>Or,</em> we can block the entirety of the instance he’s coming from.</p>

<p>In this example, I’m not sure what kind of behavior <em>usually</em> comes out of chaos.social, but we can check it to see if this is the attitude of more of its users, or if this guy is an outlier.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bskyagain/chaos.png" /></p>

<p>So, chaos.social looks pretty run-of-the-mill and likely not a massive source of basic FOSS guys trying to dictate to random people on the fediverse how they should post. We won’t have to block the whole entire instance. But! Since blocking single users is probably something everyone’s already familiar with, and doesn’t take a lot to figure out how to do, let me just show you how one <em>would</em> block the whole instance, if in fact it <em>was</em> a bed of trolls and hats of the arse.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bskyagain/block.png" /></p>

<p>If you click that little pea-pod under a user’s post, and look down, you can see the option to, as a singular user, block the entire domain.</p>

<p>What this will do, is <em>evaporate</em> all posts coming from that server, entirely. <em>You will never see them again</em>, unless you unblock them.</p>

<p>In the instance that a server happens to be a bed of trolls, maybe trolls who are sending people threats, being assholes, or generally gross, this is an <em>awesome</em> feature.</p>

<p>Now, I get it. The <em>perfect</em> social media experience would be <em>never having</em> to interact with, or deal with trolls, or people with a superiority complex. Unfortunately, that’s not the world we currently live in. When choosing a Mastodon server, or a server of any kind that’s connected to ActivityPub, it is <em>very important</em> to make sure that server has <em>rules</em>, and guidelines for behavior.</p>

<p>I understand that this is, for some, an <em>incredible</em> extra step to just signing up, and posting. But it’s <em>essential</em>. It … will really help avoid situations down the line where you’re suddenly asking the entire fediverse, “Hey, why are there so many trolls???” and then everyone’s pointing to your instance, that <em>has no rules</em>.</p>

<p>If you decide Bluesky isn’t the right place for you, <em>don’t go back to Twitter.</em> Give the “Linux of social media” a chance, and <em>maybe</em> you won’t be disappointed. Mileage may vary, but there really is something to using software that is highly customizable, near completely user owned, and run.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="mastodon" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like I do, I’ve been semi-tracking and participating in the boom of the Bluesky social network, even though it’s not decentralized, currently, in any meaningful way.

After <em>much</em> fussing with the unintuitive Github, and figuring out Twine, I <em>uploaded it directly into the fully public system where anyone can download and use it.</em> That’s right.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/gramload/gramload.png" /></p>

<p>Based on the “instaloader” code, I’ve put a GUI around it, and made it really simple to use. Just input the username of the profile you want to download (such as your own, so you can leave Instagram!), select a directory, and then download! It <em>may</em> ask you to input a username and a password, which you can also input in the provided fields (I had to do this).</p>

<p>I don’t condone using this to be malicious in any way, shape, or form. But I do condone using it to pull all of your data off of Instagram so that you can use it elsewhere. And … I guess, also back it up, away from the prying eyes of Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

<p>The source code is of course up on my github, but you don’t even need that in order to install anything. For the first time, <em>ever</em>, you can mess with one of my projects by just using a mainline Linux / Python command.</p>

<p>Hoorah.</p>

<p>It’s constructed in a way that, while downloading, it randomly spaces downloads out between 1 to 5 seconds, in order to avoid rate-limiting. I tested the app on multiple random profiles and never got rate-limited even <em>once</em>. Although, like all things, I’m sure it could still happen.</p>

<p>But for now, I sleep.</p>

<p>Now, load up your terminal and type in this:</p>

And in that respect, I’m no longer afraid to say that I had a <em>huge</em> crush on Jay Gordon, and I was also a <em>very confused</em> teenager. Hell, I’m STILL confused!</p>

<p>Keeping on-track with early-aged awakenings, I offer up this (I’m aware Marilyn Manson went down a path that sucks later in his career, and is guilty of some pretty heinous things, but we’re talking about 1999 for the moment):</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/orgy/manson.png" /></p>

<p>Does this make you feel uncomfortable? No? It didn’t make me feel uncomfortable when I was 15, but that’s how it was designed.</p>

<p>I have a deep connection to music in my life, and there were times that I abandoned it. <em>Multiple times</em>.</p>

<p>But nearly everything I was obsessed with as as kid, a teenager, all have these emotional ties to them, things that took me years to understand … <em>decades</em>.</p>

<p>And I want to double-back to Orgy, because the band really doesn’t get enough credit. They’re, what you would probably call, <em>criminally underrated</em>. And they <em>don’t have enough</em> albums. But that’s okay! Because they were touring as early as this year! So there’s hope!</p>

<p>I’ve kind of lost the plot of why I was writing this post, aside from the fact that I remembered I had a crush on Jay Gordon in 1999, and also Marilyn Manson (who, I probably won’t mention again outside of this post).</p>

<p>Uh, have a pizza?</p>

But, there is one page I know the name of, that is at least <em>partially</em> archived, and I visit it every once in a while. I’m not sure I’ll share it’s name because I made it when I was like 15 or so, and it’s <em>really</em> anime-waifu, 2001 embarrassing. But, the sad part is, while the website was somehow archived, it wasn’t fully crawled … except for a few things.</p>

<p>Most of the pages on this old site that I made in high school show nothing but blank white. But! I was … able to dig up the CSS font styling? I don’t think I even <em>made</em> that. But the place was hosted on this service called Homestead. I think, at the time, it was some Geocities alternative. And then I found a pictures archive, <em>from the website</em>, and found this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2001/n_rei.gif" /></p>

<p>Of all of the things the WayBackMachine could’ve dug up … it somehow managed to save the avatar photo I was using on my little website, <em>and</em> on Animeboards.com.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Oh, and I was also able to access <em>this</em>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/2001/rei_sidebar.jpg" /></p>

<p>Which must have been what I was using on the site’s sidebar. It’s not really anything all that special, but I can at least be like, “Hey, I wrote the filename of this image and edited it in 2001, and in some miniscule way, that’s like reaching out and glimpsing past-me.”</p>

<p>Could I do anything with this, now? Probably.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2001/rei_sidebar(2024).png" /></p>

<p>There we go, that’s marginally better. And I can tell by looking at it that I was using some kind of ancient photo editing software to manipulate it, and color out whatever was around her. I must have spent <em>a while</em> erasing that background. But, now, I can resurrect a piece of that old-internet work that I did, and add it to my modern website.</p>

<p>I <em>may not</em> be able to travel back to 2001 and stop myself from being so cringe at times, or give myself the chance to play The Sims when it was brand new again, or go on AOL Instant Messenger and talk to my two internet girlfriends one more time.</p>

<p>But, at least I got this?</p>

<p>No, but it is really a <em>shame</em> that crawlers didn’t do a better job of preserving <em>much less</em>, lesser known sites. So much of my past, that exists <em>that long ago</em> are more like spots of cloudy memory at this point. I remember the house, I remember my computer, I remember the AOL dings. I remember the addiction to the forums, the hiding my screen in software dev class while I played DOOM.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for coming along for this kind of disappointing ride back to 2001.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="oldnet" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="waybackmachine" /><category term="internet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like you do, I was digging around the WayBackMachine, trying desperately to recall the names of my old Geocities pages … much to no avail.

<p>The positive to this, is, I don’t have to worry about storage constraints with posting procedurally generated images to Bluesky, infinitely, <em>forever</em>. And the way I’ve made the Python and JavaScript pairing, is that, once this is generated, and posted, it gets deleted from the server. Foolproof. Fullproof? Which is the right word? The world may never know.</p>

<p>But, I worry about the future a lot, and I like to preserve the things I do so that, <em>no matter what happens</em>, there’s always a contingency. So, now my social media Python stuff <em>also</em> has a contingency. And there’s this, alongside maybe 8 or 9 other scripts that run on a continuous basis, or on intervals depicted by cronjobs, on <strong><em>just a six dollar per month VPS over at Digital Ocean</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it gets slow at times. I’ve logged into my server to suddenly experience severe lag. So much so, that now I have daily restart times in order to start fresh, and then throughout the day, lag builds, and builds, and builds, and then it restarts again (lol).</p>

<p>I’m <em>sure</em> there’s something I could do to make whichever script is causing this more efficient, but it all still works, regardless!</p>

<p>Just exactly what I’ll do next, I’m not sure. But I <em>do</em> think if I keep going I’ll have to upsize the droplet. Or, maybe this is <strong>enough</strong> for now. We’ll see.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Python" /><category term="python" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my efforts to continually preserve the weird things that I do, and have been doing, and/or am also learning to do, I setup a Python noise generation script, that’s completely procedural (like the other ones), and plopped it onto a Bluesky account.
