The way I deal with it, is by simply blocking and reporting every single instance of it that I see on <em>every single social platform</em>. But, is that enough?</p>

<p>Is it enough, when accounts like this sign up on a fediverse instance and just start spamming the federated feed with glossy garbage that 100% <em>more than likely</em> has stolen the likeness of a real person, and other people’s work?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/slop-again/Screenshot from 2025-03-06 17-36-37.png" /></p>

<p>Is it <em>enough</em>, when not only do accounts like this pop up on Mastodon and Bluesky, but they’ll also include something in their social bio, like, “committed to celebrating the arts and enriching the cultural landscape.” Which, for all intents and purposes, is an insult to intelligent people, and an insult to anyone who actually <em>does</em> anything.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/slop-again/Screenshot from 2025-03-06 17-43-39.png" /></p>

<p>This is just <em>one</em> example, and I include it in this post, because it was especially annoying to see, today.</p>

<p>It reeks of indifferent, superficial influencer-syndrome.</p>

<p>But, maybe we need to start calling this <em>utter shit</em> what it is: The fascist destruction of the arts.</p>

<p>During the rise of Nazi Germany, the fascist party decided for the population what they believed to be <em>acceptable</em> art, and disposed of the rest (see: <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/degenerate-art-1" target="_blank">degenerate art</a>). This can easily be correlated to the way AI generated “art” is used in modern society, <em>because every single bit of it is created and controlled by oligarchs who seek to remove and replace real humans with inauthentic algorithms,</em> and much of it is deployed on corporate social media in order to <em>aid</em> misinformation campaigns by those <em>same</em> oligarchs, and their fascist handlers in the government.</p>

<p>Also, take note that <em>a lot</em> of AI generative theft is geared toward <a href="https://www.404media.co/chinese-ai-video-generators-unleash-a-flood-of-new-nonconsensual-porn-3/" target="_blank">non-consensual porn</a>, <em>but that’s no surprise</em>, because the entire grift is based on a complete lack of consent.</p>

<p>Outside of these aspects, anyone else is just using it to “make” things they want to see, and then claiming that they’ve <em>done</em> something, that it’s <em>their</em> work (even though 99.9% of the time it looks like utter trash, and is based on the real work of millions of people who never even so much as received any notice that their work was scraped).</p>

<p>But, why? Why do they do this?</p>

<p>A fascist is incapable of creating. A fascist can only destroy.</p>

<p>Generative AI is a fascist, total destruction of the arts. <em>Mostly</em> deployed by billionaire scum fueling misinformation, and largely used by people who either <em>can’t</em> create, or have some other agenda related to instant gratification, or things that <em>should be crimes against humanity</em>. Stop sharing AI, stop posting slop, and push these parasites <em>off</em> of community-owned social media, before they’re allowed to invade, unhindered.</p>

<p>No, in relation to Mastodon, I don’t care if the instance you’re on makes exceptions for AI slop in that as long as a user discloses that it’s AI, they’re allowed. If you ask me, that’s too soft. Admins and moderators on Mastodon, especially, <em>have got to stop being soft</em>.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to write about all of this, at first, because it’s just one thing in a years-long trend of Mozilla betraying everything they’re supposed to stand for in order to ride the generative theft and destruction train. But! I’ve seen maybe … <em>one</em> person talk about their new acceptable use policy, and for all intents and purposes, they <em>absolutely</em> now prohibit the use of their services to display pornographic material.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “Who cares? Is porn that important?”</p>

<p>Most people are online to look at porn, or, <em>at least</em>, they <em>do</em> at some point. It’s human nature.</p>

<p>Via their own new <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/acceptable-use/" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy</a></p>

<blockquote>
You may not use any of Mozilla’s services to:<br /><br />

Upload, download, transmit, display, or grant access to content that includes graphic depictions of sexuality...
</blockquote>

<p>Because, you <em>definitely</em> need a tech company to decide for you what you can view using a web browser, or technology connected to it.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn’t <em>explicitly</em> state that viewing porn <em>with</em> Firefox is a breach of their AUP. It’s more to do with their cloud and/or other services, like syncing, tab sharing between devices, and so on. But! If you’re a <em>regular</em> Firefox user, you probably do <em>at least</em> one of these things, and you’ve probably <em>already</em> violated their updated Acceptable Use Policy.</p>

<p>This news came alongside other changes they made, such as casually talking about how they’re <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/technical-and-interaction-data" target="_blank">collecting your browser interaction data</a>.</p>

<p>So … actually, maybe it <em>would</em> be a violation of their AUP to even so much as search for something like “boobies.”</p>

<p>You be the judge!</p>

<p>I’ll be on <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a>. Not because porn is a central reason for my using the internet (I switched to Vivaldi months and months ago after Mozilla introduced AI “features” into their browser), but because Mozilla wants <em>everything you do</em> to be a record that they can collect, and use for their own gain, <em>including</em> training AI, among a million other things they shouldn’t be doing. And I just don’t have any time, or energy for all of that. Everything is <em>already</em> exhausting and annoying, <em>enough</em>.</p>

<p>With the rise of generative theft continuing, and the general masses growing closer and closer to excusing it, or turning a blind eye to it: You certainly don’t have to be among them. And you shouldn’t be okay with your personal data being used to train the fascist destruction of the arts.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="tech" /><category term="tech" /><category term="mozilla" /><category term="firefox" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update: I’ve been made aware that Mozilla’s AUP has been the same for decades, and this is only coming to light, because the egregious changes they’ve made more recently have brought more strange things to the surface.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Neo Machina: Online</title><link href="https://mkultra.monster/secondlife/2025/03/04/neo-machina-online.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Neo Machina: Online" /><published>2025-03-04T11:27:51-05:00</published><updated>2025-03-04T11:27:51-05:00</updated><id>https://mkultra.monster/secondlife/2025/03/04/neo-machina-online</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mkultra.monster/secondlife/2025/03/04/neo-machina-online.html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been quite a while since my city in Second Life has been online, or even <em>seen</em> any light of day.

<p>Returning with Neo Machina, is as follows: The Outpost Nightclub, the public swimming pool, the lasertag arena, the apartment highrise, the rentable shops around town, the arcade, the back-alley cafe, the nanite systems charging garage, and, of course, my personal main-store.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m working on remodeling the highrise apartments in a way that makes more sense for those who rent, for a 50 land impact size.

It’s always some controversial topic, or a topic of interest, and then a week of lulls in inspiration of <em>anything</em> to write about. There’s plenty going on in the world, and there are lots of people talking about that stuff. But, I figured, it’s time for a change of pace. I want to talk <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">about my Patreon</a>, and hopefully bring in some new faces.</p>

<p>In October 2014, right on the heels of having lost my job at the time (see: harassment, bullying, failures of HR, etc.), I started up a Patreon that would be central to my creative writing. I mostly used it to upload little drafts of snippets as I worked my way through a novel I was writing. For a while, though, I kind of stopped posting (as I began maintaining a store in Second Life), and didn’t really pick it up again until 2017. And, ever since, I’ve been giving regular updates.</p>

<p>Updates in regard to writing, a whole lot of music (seriously, a <em>huge</em> amount), things relating to my Second Life store, and then, eventually, blog posts, and web development related achievements.</p>

<p>I’m not really a traditional creator in the sense that, I don’t have a merch store, I don’t really have any material rewards that I offer, and I’m not a big streamer, or Youtuber who enjoys posting my face online at all times. Mostly, if you’re on my Patreon for, at minimum, a dollar, you can download a zip archive of <em>every single album I’ve ever released</em>, plus copies of my old books that, at this point, I’m not sure anyone even knows exists anymore. And, then, of course, there’s my, admittedly, <em>pretty quiet</em> Discord channel with auto-roles, where you can join, and hey, maybe start up some conversations!</p>

<p>In regard to Second Life, I have a Patreon group in-world that gives an automatic discount on all of my digital products.</p>

<p>But, you don’t even have to pay. You can just follow my Patreon, and this helps boost its visibility to others.</p>

<p>The reason I’m writing this, though, is, why? Why do I have a Patreon?</p>

<p>For <em>years</em>, I’ve worked pretty much <em>nothing</em> but retail. I graduated high school as a kid who wrote websites in notepad, and, even as I inch closer to 40: I’m still that kid who writes websites in notepad. But, I could never really hack college. I’ve tried numerous times and I just do not have the energy to hold down a job, and then also stress out about assignments, homework, and mid-terms. I just can’t.</p>

<p>I have a Patreon, because if ever there’s an escape from menial jobs that I’ve <em>never wanted to be my career</em>, it’s going to come from community support. From people looking at my work, looking at what I do, and deciding to support it. Which, isn’t even an <em>impossible</em> endeavor. There are people online <em>right now</em> who make an entire living just … <em>doing what they love</em>.</p>

<p>And what do <em>I</em> want to do? I want to be … a web developer. I want to be a <em>creator</em>, a writer, a <em>maker</em>. But what makes that so hard to achieve, <em>now</em>, is that I am almost completely bogged down, mentally, by my day job. Escaping to a career becomes harder and harder, as you get older, because manual labor, and the stresses of jobs that treat you like a number, a replaceable, disposable number, eventually <em>takes its toll</em>.</p>

<p>I will <em>never accept</em> that this is just the way it is. Even if it’s until my last breath, I will <em>keep trying</em> to do what I love, what I <em>really</em> want to do. Because, without that, what else is there?</p>

<p>You should jump on my Patreon, so that I can build a cushion, a <em>foundation</em> for escape. And, you know, <em>if you like what I do</em>, and make, and write. This isn’t a thing where I want people who aren’t interested in anything I do to simply sign up out of a feeling of obligation. Absolutely <em>only</em> sign up if you’re genuinely interested in my work, or what I do.</p>

<p>I know times are rough, and nobody’s got any money anymore, but the only way to build a future, is to <em>actually talk about that future.</em></p>

One of the issues I was having, is that it’s <em>really</em> cumbersome to have to generate a post, then make that post, then commit, and sync to NeoCities … <em>just to put up one Post, Note, or Log</em>. To me, this is useful, and really cool, but it also doesn’t <em>feel</em> like posting on social media. So what do you do?</p>

<p>Well, of course, you setup reverse publishing/syndication, and backup every single thing you post to Mastodon in converted markdown files formatted for Jekyll, that are then fed into a Liquid feed!</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://git.garrido.io/gabriel/mastodon-markdown-archive#installation" target="_blank">this repository</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you go through the process of getting this thing setup, and <em>make sure</em> you specify that you want to use a Jekyll template (you’ve got to set that up yourself), and point it at a directory on your website, so that you can effectively setup a cronjob that just backs up all of your posts, <em>daily</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s my bash script for backing up my Mastodon posts to a directory on my local machine, where my website is stored:</p>

<p><em>graboots.sh</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash

export MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here

PREVIOUS_SINCE_ID=""

# Function to delete posts containing the specified phrase
delete_posts_with_phrase() {
  local phrase="$1"
  local directory="$2"
  for post_file in "$directory"/*.md; do
    if grep -q "$phrase" "$post_file"; then
      echo "Excluding post: $post_file"
      rm "$post_file"
    fi
  done
}

while true; do
  SINCE_ID=$(test -f /home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots/first &amp;&amp; cat /home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots/first || echo '')
  
  if [[ "$SINCE_ID" == "$PREVIOUS_SINCE_ID" ]]; then
    echo "No new posts. Exiting"
    break
  fi

  command="/home/cmdr-nova/.local/go/bin/mastodon-markdown-archive --dist=/home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots \

    --since-id=$SINCE_ID \
    --template=/home/cmdr-nova/jekyll.tmpl \
    --filename={{.Post.Id}}.md"
  
  output=$($command)

  if [[ "$output" -eq 0 ]]; then
    echo "No new posts. Exiting"
    break
  fi
  echo "Fetched $output posts. Continuing."
  
  # Delete posts containing the phrase "Posted via Nova Prime:"
  delete_posts_with_phrase "Posted via Nova Prime:" "/home/cmdr-nova/Documents/Website/cmdr-nova.github.io/_toots"
  
  PREVIOUS_SINCE_ID=$SINCE_ID
  sleep 1
done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But then, this isn’t <em>everything</em> you need to do in order to make this work, right? So, you probably <em>also</em> want each of these posts on your site to link back to their original location (for as long as they exist), and to <em>also</em> use the images include in posts that are backed up, <em>that have images</em>, right?</p>

<p>Okay, so run this script every single time you build your Jekyll site:</p>

<p><em>syndicate_toots.py</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import os

def update_toot_file(toot_file, post_id, image_path=None):
    # Construct the Mastodon syndication
    mastodon_link = f'https://mastodon.online/@cmdr_nova/{post_id}'

    # Read the content of the toot
    with open(toot_file, 'r') as file:
        content = file.readlines()

    # Check if the mastodon link is already present
    if not any(line.startswith('mastodon:') for line in content):
        # Insert the mastodon link into the front matter
        for i, line in enumerate(content):
            if line.strip() == '---' and i != 0:
                content.insert(i, f'mastodon: {mastodon_link}\n')
                break

    # Check if the image path is provided and not already present
    if image_path and not any(line.startswith('image:') for line in content):
        # Insert the image path into the front matter
        for i, line in enumerate(content):
            if line.strip() == '---' and i != 0:
                content.insert(i, f'image: {image_path}\n')
                break

    # Insert the image tag at the end of the content if not already present
    if image_path and not any(f'&lt;img src="{image_path}"' in line for line in content):
        content.append(f'\n&lt;img src="{image_path}" alt="Image"&gt;\n')

    # Write the updated content back to the toot
    with open(toot_file, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines(content)

# Process individual markdown files in the toots directory
for toot_file in glob.glob(os.path.join(toots_dir, '*.md')):
    # Extract the post ID from the filename
    post_id = os.path.basename(toot_file).replace('.md', '')
    update_toot_file(toot_file, post_id)

# Process folders containing an index.md file in the toots directory
for toot_folder in glob.glob(os.path.join(toots_dir, '*/')):
    index_file = os.path.join(toot_folder, 'index.md')
    if os.path.exists(index_file):
        # Extract the post ID from the folder name
        post_id = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(index_file))
        # Find the image file in the folder (assuming only one image per folder)
        image_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(toot_folder, '*.*'))
        image_path = None
        for image_file in image_files:
            if image_file != index_file:
                # Construct the relative image path
                image_path = f'/toots/{post_id}/{os.path.basename(image_file)}'
                break
        update_toot_file(index_file, post_id, image_path)

print("Toots updated successfully.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, <em>obviously</em>, this is going to take a bit more setup than just putting both of these scripts together. You probably keep your files in different places than I do, and you might not even <em>want</em> a Jekyll template. Furthermore, you also still need to construct your site in order to be <em>able</em> to include these markdown files <em>within</em> the Liquid feed that’s already included on a Jekyll website.</p>

<p>But, other than that, there we go!</p>

<p>Everything I post on Mastodon, will now post to my website (as long as I remember to commit and sync daily), using this cronjob:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0 2 * * * /home/cmdr-nova/grabtoots.sh
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is, <em>essentially</em>, my answer as to <em>how</em> to make it so that I can post to my website from my phone, albeit, a little bit of an extreme work-around, but very simple once you’ve got it all up and running.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Webdev" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="syndication" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been doing a lot in order to get my website to act as a more central place where all of my thoughts and posts are stored.

So what do you do?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">That’s Very Decentralized Of You, Bluesky</title><link href="https://mkultra.monster/socialmedia/2025/02/26/thats-very-decentralized-of-you-bluesky.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="That’s Very Decentralized Of You, Bluesky" /><published>2025-02-26T07:29:44-05:00</published><updated>2025-02-26T07:29:44-05:00</updated><id>https://mkultra.monster/socialmedia/2025/02/26/thats-very-decentralized-of-you-bluesky</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mkultra.monster/socialmedia/2025/02/26/thats-very-decentralized-of-you-bluesky.html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ve probably heard it by now, or have seen my <em>many</em> posts on here about Bluesky, and their false claims of decentralization, or of what kind of social network they’re even <em>trying to be.</em> From their blockchain, crypto investors, to the extreme right-wing accounts they refuse to moderate: Welcome to Twitter 2: The Reckoning.</p>

<p>What I’m writing about today, is more on that same subject, and also in regard to someone I once looked up to.</p>

<p>I have kind of a … complicated history, in regard to Parker Molloy. Back on Twitter, almost ten years ago at this point, I was kind of a hopeful writer who wanted to be like her. I wanted to write for publications and make <em>that</em> my career. In retrospect, I still think it would be cool if that happened.</p>

<p>But … I wrote some kind of “article” piece on my website at the time, which was just some hacky Wordpress looking thing, about an LGBTQ+ topic (I don’t even remember anymore what that topic was), and then I shared it with her. I guess I was hoping to get some kind of notable mention, or a foot-in-the-door toward what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Instead, she quoted my post, and called it “Mostly hyperbole, with grains of truth.” To which I was made fun of, and heckled by her followers.</p>

<p>Flash forward, it’s 2025, and I’m quoting Parker Molloy from her Bluesky account, where she’s pointing out that the one and singular moderation team behind Bluesky has completely removed a post from being viewed by <em>the entire network</em>.</p>

<p>So, it seems to <em>look like</em> the Bluesky moderation is protecting Donald Trump’s interests, and proving even more-so, that the people behind Bluesky understand “decentralization” much in the same way Bitcoin investors do: They don’t.</p>

<p>The content of the video is questionable, of course. It … well, <em>is</em> an explicit, non-consensual generation, deep-fake, AI … <em>thing</em>.</p>

<p>The question is: Should anyone give a shit? Should anyone <em>give two shits</em> when this kind of thing is targeting two people who are absolutely tearing down and devastating not just the entire United States, but the <em>world</em>, at-large?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Is it <em>newsworthy</em>, does it <em>matter</em>, according to Parker, if it remains on the platform? I think it’s actually <em>more</em> newsworthy that Bluesky has, over, and over again, shown their real colors, by continuing to protect the interests of <em>fascists</em>.</p>

<p>So, in that respect, yeah, it <em>does</em> matter that they took it down.</p>

<p>It matters that an alleged twenty to thirty million people continue to use this network, despite <em>all of the evidence</em> that they shouldn’t, while an <em>actual</em> decentralized solution is directly in front of all of them. And their excuses for not distancing themselves from fascist venture capitalists, range from “I don’t like nerd shit” and “Choosing servers is hard.”</p>

<p>Well, I think, at this point, the bed’s made, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Yeah, I have an account on Bluesky, where I’m mostly feeding RSS updates. Just like I have a <em>mostly</em> inactive account on Threads where I occasionally log on to see if the influencers, who don’t talk to anyone, are still complaining about nobody interacting with them.</p>

<p>But, like I do, each time that Bluesky fucks up, I’ll provide a link here to a site where you can decide for yourself, if you’d like to <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net/?lang=en-us" target="_blank">join the ActivityPub network</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve probably heard it by now, or have seen my many posts on here about Bluesky, and their false claims of decentralization, or of what kind of social network they’re even trying to be.

At least, since I introduced writing Notes and Logs on here, in a quick and simple way to just <em>post something</em> without worrying about it sounding coherent and planned. It’s only going to continue, from here, though, when I figure out how I can do this <em>easily</em> from my phone. But, I’m not writing this to talk about how much I like shotgunning random crap into the world via my own website. I wanted to talk about RSS.</p>

<p>Sure, I could talk about Bluesky again, and how, no matter how much I try and enjoy or like the app, the feed keeps working <em>against</em> my interest and attention.</p>

<p>I could talk about how I’m entering day five of my offline job, five days after having one day off that I had after three days of work. A nine day stretch where I’ve had little rest, and hardly any sleep.</p>

<p>But, no! It’s RSS time.</p>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> RSS?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RSS (RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication)[2] is a web feed[3] that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. News aggregators (or “RSS readers”) can be built into a browser, installed on a desktop computer, or installed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank"><i>via Wikipedia.</i></a></p>

<p>RSS is something that “came out” a little over 25 years ago, now, in 1999, when Netscape was still a browser you could use. Fun fact! Did you know the corporate bloodsuckers destroying Mozilla own Netscape, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite#History_and_development" target="_blank">it’s called Firefox</a>?</p>

<p>Ever since its beginnings, it’s always just been this plain text thing that you can plug into a reader, and use to keep tabs on your favorite subjects, or people’s blogs. And that’s what it <em>remains</em>, today. But, as social media eats itself alive, and the options grow fewer (aside from ActivityPub and <em>maybe</em> Bluesky), RSS becomes <em>very important</em>, once again.</p>

<p>Fun fact, number two! Did you know that Youtube channels have RSS feeds? Did you know that you can subvert all of Google’s ads no matter <em>what they do</em>, by simply using <a href="https://freetubeapp.io" target="_blank">FreeTube</a>, an app that pulls from Youtube RSS feeds?</p>

<p>I’ve talked before about how you should have a website. How all of your data should <em>belong to you</em>, and not some billionaire jerk-ass who can and <em>will</em> delete everything you’ve ever done in the snap of a finger, just because. And I’ve <em>even</em> written guides on how to build one yourself.</p>

<p>But, what do you do <em>after</em> that? Well, … you setup an RSS feed, of course.</p>

<p>And it’s really simple, and maybe I’ll write a guide on how to do that, if whatever you’re using for your site doesn’t already provide you with one. You just setup an XML that reads your posts from a directory and then shoots them out into the digital universe.</p>

<p>I mean, okay. It’s a <em>little</em> more complicated than that. But! A lot of prebuilt blogging software <em>already</em> has this built-in. Wordpress has it. Ghost has it. Heck, I think Jekyll has a plugin, or a feature <em>built-in</em> to the software that generates one <em>for you</em>, but I made one myself. Because I’m not <em>just</em> sharing posts. And also, there’s some kind of weird timezone discrepancy I still haven’t figured out, that’s causing all kinds of issues.</p>

<p>You can see my RSS feed <a href="https://mkultra.monster/rss_feed.xml" target="_blank">here</a>, and, depending on what you’re using to view my site, it <em>might</em> show up as plain text versions of everything I post, <em>or</em>, it’ll look like a jumble of code with some words. Which is fine! Just plug the URL into a reader, or even your e-mail client (if it allows it), and voila!</p>

<p>Fun fact, number three! Did you know the <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">Vivaldi browser</a> has a reader built-in? And it’ll just automatically convert all of that weird code into a feed cloud that looks <em>a lot</em> like the Tumblr feeds of old (you know, that page you get when you’re viewing all of someone’s posts at once).</p>

<p>Say hello to long-form posts, without all the styling you have on your website (a great way for people to keep up with what you’re writing and saying, without having to go all the way to your site, itself), in a simple-to-read interface.</p>

<p>The thing is, you don’t <em>have</em> to keep it confined to <em>just</em> long-form blog posts, though. You can, essentially, use it as a mailing list. You can use it as a one-way social feed of your thoughts, to readers. You can use it to share pictures of your cat with <em>anyone who subscribes to your feed</em>.</p>

<p>Bro.</p>

<p>Welcome to social media, 1999.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, if you don’t want to do <em>any of this</em>, I would <em>at least</em> recommend finding a nice home on a solid server via Mastodon, or some-such ActivityPub app. But, if you want to get into the <em>really</em> hardcore nerd shit, definitely start using an RSS feed. And plug it <em>everywhere</em>. It’s like … a podcast, of your THOUGHTS! IT’S TELEPATHY!</p>

<p>For real though, as the infrastructure of everything crumbles and corporations destroy all that’s left that’s good in the world, you should have a contingency. Even if it means speaking to the internet the way that we used to, before Google destroyed everything.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><category term="rss" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a while since I’ve written some kind of long-form post on my site.

And, well, yeah. That’s exactly correct. For all intents and purposes, if you’re just online to chat, and make friends with random people, that’s cool. You can do that in any space you choose, and you <em>should</em>. That’s the way the internet used to be.</p>

<p>For people like me, I use the internet for this reason as well, even though I’m … <em>terrible</em> at making friends in my near 40s, as a closeted trans woman, who spends most of my life, nowadays, hiding <em>everything about myself</em> in public spaces, and just … surviving.</p>

<p>The other half of me is online, <em>still online</em>, attempting to share the things I do: The music, the writing, the art, the things I make in Second Life (even though I haven’t been paying much creative attention to that as of late), and it’s <em>rough</em>.</p>

<p>You’ve got places like Reddit that have this toxic mindset built-in, where the only people allowed to share their work, are people who have already made it big. Otherwise, you’re breaking the rules.</p>

<p>You’ve got Bluesky, where gaining traction with <em>anything</em> is like playing the lottery, and, like post-2020 social media everywhere, if you don’t employ manipulative engagement tactics, you’re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p>You’ve got Threads, which is exactly the same, except they’ve got <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/stories/meta-policy-updates-could-encourage-hate-threaten-democracy/" target="_blank">bigotry coded into their Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>And then you have Mastodon/ActivityPub (and other associated apps), where talking and chatting is highly encouraged, but building takes time. <em>A lot of time</em>. And some people <em>don’t even take kindly to those who are trying to build some kind of audience on the platform/s</em>. Which, is a shame. ActivityPub is probably one of the greatest things to happen to the internet. That it’s been partially colonized by the privileged who don’t or haven’t scraped by, or <em>needed</em> a helping hand, or even just <em>support for their work</em>, is a little bit of a minor tragedy.</p>

<p>But, it hasn’t suddenly become <em>more</em> hostile to creatives, online, though. It’s <em>always been that way</em>. It’s just <em>worse</em>, now. <em>Especially</em> with the rise of algorithmic theft from the un-creative, who seek to profit off of artificially generated slop, derived from people who <em>do</em> work.</p>

<p>Long ago, though, there was Twitter. The <em>real</em> Twitter. And, sure, the place was <em>always</em> toxic. This idealistic pretend idea that people have in their heads, that Twitter used to be some kind of amazing social utopia … are living in a fantasy world.</p>

<p>But!</p>

<p>Twitter was instrumental in my album <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com/album/ride-eternal" target="_blank">Ride Eternal</a> becoming a bestseller (before the calamity of twitter-synthwave dudes having a meltdown over transness in “their” “scene”), and, apart from Mastodon (I have had a lot of random support via ActivityPub, sporadically, throughout the years), I made <em>a lot</em> of progress for my work on the platform. The loss of Twitter wasn’t just a loss of some central “community square” online, it was a loss in an audience of thousands of people I, and others, had connections to.</p>

<p>It’s all gone.</p>

<p>And, now, what are we left with? To sift and jump back and forth between different spaces, <em>hoping</em> that something <em>sticks</em> hard enough that you can stop jumping back … and forth.</p>

<p>For many, this hasn’t happened.</p>

<p>For me, that is why my website is now my own personal social platform. My most important thoughts, my writing, my announcements, my little shitposts, or random things I want to say: They come here, <em>first</em>, and then they go to the other places.</p>

<p>To me, this is <em>the only</em> answer to the loss of some central idea of a community square where you really <em>could</em> reach thousands of people who might be interested in what you do.</p>

<p>I will <em>never</em> put my work, my thoughts, and my words, solely into the hands of corporate overlords, <em>ever again</em>.</p>

<p>My website cannot be <em>taken</em> from me, it can’t be lost forever, it can’t be deleted by some CEO who didn’t like what I had to say, it can’t be mobbed and silenced by evil little shitheads with ulterior motives and fears over the marginalized occupying spaces in their industries.</p>

<p>As long as I have a PC, thumb drives, portable hard drives, a laptop, a <em>phone</em>, my website sticks around, no matter what happens to the server it’s hosted on.</p>

<p>And that’s <em>awesome</em>.</p>

<p>Even if the government becomes <em>fully</em> 1984, and blocks out all sorts of content at the ISP level, I’ll just take my website to TOR.</p>

<p>That’s why you should <em>own your content</em>.</p>

<p>You <em>should</em> post on these platforms, and try and see what sticks. But your most important posts, well, they should be on a website. <em>Your</em> website. In 2025, this is the <em>only answer</em> to the destruction of the digital social landscape, and you owe it to yourself to <em>at least</em> spin something up on a template builder, if <em>anything</em> (although I do encourage learning at least the basics of HTML).</p>

<p>It’s rough out there on the world wide web, and it’s <em>never</em> been harder for creatives to find their people, and their audience. But, it <em>can be done</em>. The first step, is to <em>own your content</em>.</p>

<p>Now, <em>of course</em>, some select few people might see this sort of idea as “nerd shit.” And they’re free to think that way. I remember back in middle and high school, when “nerd” was a legitimate insult that inspired all kinds of bullying. And, I’m thankful, that the internet is <em>not</em> high school, and that people who are mentally <em>stuck</em> there, <em>probably</em> won’t be a real big part of the future digital social landscape.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="creators" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see, sometimes, people talking about how they don’t really use any specific social media app as reinforcement of anything they do, or share, in regard to work, or art, and that if they did … if that was their main mode of deriving support, money, and so on, and so forth: They’d be screwed.

Now, I played a little bit of the first one, but that was years back, and I got confused or stuck around the beginning, so I didn’t really pick it up again. At the time, it was a game I never really saw anyone talk about, so I didn’t really assume much of it.</p>

<p>That was, until the second one released.</p>

<p>Long story short, I have it. I played through … the beginning.</p>

<p>Not to spoil too much, I <em>eventually</em> made it to the point where the game drops you off into the world, and pushes you in the direction of doing <em>whatever the heck it was you want to do.</em></p>

<p>Oh boy.</p>

<p>I got let out of the pillory (yes, you get arrested, for reasons), and my buddy, the stuck-up dude, well, he abandoned me. I’m not sure if this was a consequence of your own actions, or if it’s meant to happen. So, I’m just going to assume that this is <em>supposed</em> to happen.</p>

<p>A lady stops you and helps you out a little, mentions something about finding work.</p>

<p>See, I’m someone who comes from games like Skyrim and Baldur’s Gate. I’m pretty familiar with finding quests in RPGs.</p>

<p>Haha.</p>

<p>I think I spent about ten minutes running around trying to figure out who would pay me to do things, until I ran into someone’s house and saw a bowl of food. I figured, “Hey, nobody’s here, and I need to eat!” So <em>I did</em>.</p>

<p>Upon immediately turning around, there’s a guy staring at me, and you can probably guess what happened next.</p>

<p>I was back in the pillories.</p>

<p>Another day later, I’m notified that if I commit another crime, I’ll be marked by an executioner or something, and that my character is fed up.</p>

<p>I put my clothes back on and head back into town again, hoping that maybe <em>this time</em> I’ll find some work. I wander around for a bit, and almost get hit with multiple trespassing charges.</p>

<p>It’s at this point that I’m getting kind of tired with my bumbling self almost, or completely breaking the law. I ran all the way out of town into the woods, and fell asleep in some abandoned camp under a bunch of trees. Finally, I was fully healed, and eating an apple out of my pocket.</p>

<p>Yeah. I had food in my pockets that I forgot about.</p>

<p>But now it was night time and pitch black. I’m warned about carrying a torch, in that, it’s a crime if I don’t have one. Another crime!</p>

<p>So I ran. I ran and ran directly into more woods, until I stumbled upon another small village. Nobody’s around. Perfect chance to … steal a horse! Which, was pretty easy, but I’m assuming that because it was dark, nobody saw me!</p>

<p>I decided for myself that my quest was to find my dog, so I road off into the dark again. Fell off the horse a few times, got back on. Eventually, after fumbling with my map and not being able to see where I’m going, I make it to where my dog is supposed to be, and I’m stopped by some guy.</p>

<p>I killed that guy, and took all his money.</p>

<p>Then I found 125 moneys in a pot under another tree by a rock.</p>

<p>With my dog still missing, I figured I’d run around the lake and at least see if … I can find anymore dead bodies with loot.</p>

<p>No such luck.</p>

<p>I run into a pack of wild dogs, and after about three minutes of flailing my sword around, I am dead.</p>

<p>And back at the village that I ran away from.</p>

<p>The game is pretty cool so far! I’ve definitely been experiencing some sort of deliverance, that’s for sure. Delivering my own self into pillories and death.</p>

<p>We’ll see how it goes next time I load it up.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="kingdom-come" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been spending a couple of days sprucing up my site, adding things to the feed, making it more like … a social media feed, and then I got myself a copy of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

It’s a pretty useless app, now, but there are at least some ideas for things to write about. Although, I’m <em>almost certain</em> there are probably easier ways to get daily writing prompts in order to fuel my need to write things. Never-the-less, today’s prompt is all about just … describing your dream home. As a millennial, this is a pipe-dream. A far-away thing that will likely never happen. But, if I could <em>somehow</em> have a home, that I own, what would it be, really?</p>

<p>There is, <em>of course</em>, the old haunted house I lived in when I was sixteen, that I’ve always thought would be <em>really cool</em> to buy, and then renovate, and take care of. But, it’s not really my <em>dream</em> home. It’s more like, a link to the past that I could actively live inside of, as if that would provide some level of comfort as the past, and the way things used to be, gets further and further away from me.</p>

<p>It would make me think of things like, hanging out the window in my room late at night smoking a cigarette. Sitting in front of my hand-me-down 486 choosing a cool anime wallpaper for my desktop. My highschool girlfriend picking me up for school in her jalopy of a car, and the one time I accidentally sleepily dialed 911 when I was trying to call her (to ask how far away she was).</p>

<p><em>That was one hell of a morning, having an ambulance outside wondering what the shit was happening, and my Dad outside, just as confused.</em></p>

<p>Maybe … maybe, it wouldn’t be <em>that</em> great of an idea to live in a place that makes me think of things, and the ways I was, that will never be, ever again. I learned that a couple of months ago when I wrote to that aforementioned highschool ex-girlfriend, and sort of poured out my feelings and thoughts as to why I couldn’t be just some side-thing, like she wanted, twenty years after abandoning what I thought would be the rest of my life, at the time.</p>

<p>She didn’t answer.</p>

<p>And that’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>So, if we’re talking a <em>real</em> dream home, I think I’d go out somewhere, maybe in the midwest, far away from the bustle of <em>other people</em>. I’d go out into the woods and drop down maybe two shipping containers, and I’d have them conditioned for living. There’d be water nearby, so that I could fish whenever I want, and I’d have a studio for gaming and working on all the things that I do on a daily basis. The outside would be covered in camouflage nets and black paint, and the inside would be a sort of … rustic gothic.</p>

<p>Sword collections, a battle-axe over a side table. Another shelf on the opposite side of the living area showcasing all the little game and anime figures I’ve collected over the years. In the center, a gigantic flat-screen television and whatever the latest and best console is.</p>

<p>The kitchen would be a wood-burning stove with ventilation connected to the outside, but there’d also be a modern fridge with temperature display and voice-activated features. But all the smart tech in my home would be running on a reverse proxy that redirects their tracking software to some other location.</p>

<p>The bathroom would have one of those rich-person walk-in showers that you just kind of, stand in while water falls on top of you in kind of an open concept where the sink and toilet are just kinda, right there, <em>also</em>.</p>

<p>But, there’d be a more private bathroom tucked at the back of the master, and <em>only</em> bedroom. Of course, the bed itself would be made out of top-of-the-line memory foam and down-feather sheets or whatever, and there’d be a gigantic glass window in the ceiling that looks out into the stars at night.</p>

<p>Maybe it’d be smart, so I could dim it, or blend it with the ceiling during the day.</p>

<p>There would be a security system surrounding the property, and all of this would be connected to a secondary PC in my studio, with alarms, and footage that’s all saved to my home server, that’d be tucked away in a large walk-in closet. A home server that also has built-in custom water-cooling, and the best of the best technology. That all runs on Linux, <em>of course</em>.</p>

<p>The front door, and the <em>only</em> door, would be reinforced steel, along with the paneling on the outside. Indestructible and impervious to most things, including bullets, and maybe even a grenade.</p>

<p>Then, the best kept secret of my home, would be the bunker beneath all of it, filled with perishables, water, and whatever amenities one might need in the event that <em>something</em> happens. Zombies, nukes, the Night of the Walking Entitled Rich People, whatever. I’ll be ready.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t have a car. I wouldn’t need it. There’d be a secure mailing box at the edge of the woods where my actual address would be, and I’d just order whatever I need, at all times. Imagine ordering a burger on Doordash and you’re like, “Just drop it off at the big huge box on the side of the road.”</p>

<p>And maybe … <em>that</em> could be a dream home. A dream home that’s also future-proof, and ready for disaster.</p>

<p>Maybe it sounds like a prepper’s dream, and that’s kinda funny, cause I’m not really a doomsday prepper. But, if I <em>had the money</em>, maybe I <strong>would</strong> be. Who knows!</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="WritingPrompt" /><category term="writing-prompt" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I’m taking a prompt from the old Jetpack app that I’ve had installed on my phone ever since I still ran a Wordpress blog. It’s a pretty useless app, now, but there are at least some ideas for things to write about. Although, I’m almost certain there are probably easier ways to get daily writing prompts in order to fuel my need to write things. Never-the-less, today’s prompt is all about just … describing your dream home. As a millennial, this is a pipe-dream. A far-away thing that will likely never happen. But, if I could somehow have a home, that I own, what would it be, really?]]></summary></entry></feed>
