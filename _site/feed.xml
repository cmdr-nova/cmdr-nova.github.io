But more, a time when things were less chaotic, and we were all kinda just vibing with whatever was happening. Drinking our Ecto-Coolers, slipping on Velcro sneakers, uh, watching Rocko’s Modern Life.</p>

<p>But sometimes I also wish it was still 2012. Still in the midst of the Mass Effect trilogy, the greatest game series <em>ever created</em>. Still logging onto a <em>mostly</em> normal Facebook to get my daily clicks in Mafia Wars and Farmville.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/2012/mafiwars.png" /></p>

<p>A time when Sims 3 was the latest and greatest of the franchise, and <em>all I was doing</em> in the game was walking my sim around collecting diamonds and rocks, and trying to figure out what kind of bathroom she should have. When I was still mystified by new experiences, and finding wonder in exploring new narratives. Back when the iPhone still had what I think were the best icon graphics, a headphone jack, and iPods! Yeah, I had an iPod Touch! …that I played digital poker with.</p>

<p>When I’d jump on Google cam-chats with friends, lay in bed, and just talk all night long, and when Youtube was just a place where people uploaded random weird stuff that wasn’t designed to pull you in and keep you there for ad-rolls and sponsored segments.</p>

<p>… when cigarettes only cost like, four dollars a pack.</p>

<p>A year wherein I’d get out of work and still have the energy to <em>do things that I enjoy</em>.</p>

<p>I miss 2012.</p>

<p>There’s no use living in the past, but there were <em>a lot</em> of great things about technology in the 90s, and 2000s, and even 2010. And then suddenly it all started going downhill. Things <em>advanced</em>, but for <em>no reason</em>. Oh boy, bigger cameras, larger screens, thinner bezels, s … streaming? I don’t <em>own</em> my music and movies anymore? All the casual games I liked using to pass time are on my phone? Sweet! … oh, almost <em>all of them</em> are copies of each other and filled with so much money-grubbing they could only really be classified as a game for the first 5 minutes that you interact with it?</p>

<p>Instagram is about posting engagement-bait and getting popular with short-form content until you can … get sponsored with product placement?</p>

<p>Twitter got murdered by Elon Musk and now it’s just nazis and ai-gen spam?</p>

<p>What the <em>heck</em>?</p>

<p><strong><em>I miss 2012.</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s not all bad. We got Mastodon, we got a federated network of users taking ownership of their content, and the indie web (a revival of the 90s internet). There are still <em>good</em> games out there, and a whole lot of indie developers who make some real gems. But, <em>man</em>, do you really have to sift through mountains and oceans of garbage to find content and entertainment <em>actually worth consuming</em>.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I’m just getting older, and everything is just <em>fine</em> the way it is.</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve written a lot about how much I miss the 90s, and sometimes pine for an age in the 80s, and, obviously, I’m not talking … politically.

Partially because, <em>usually</em>, when I share what I write, <em>it doesn’t even show a headline</em>. But, you’re probably wondering, “What could Mastodon/the fediverse possibly have that MySpace doesn’t?”</p>

<p>Twitter has fabricated and AI generated misinformation, Threads has influencers in a battle royale to see who can steal the most posts written by normal people, Bluesky has all the bullies from social justice circles who never got anywhere with their quote-tweet dogpiling, and Mastodon has …</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/monsterdon/monsterdon.png" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Snarky and sarcastic remarks aside, this <em>isn’t</em> really isolated to Mastodon. It’s just that it’s <em>named</em> after Mastodon. But, like all things on the fediverse, it reaches most software connected to it. But that’s not what this post is about. We’re talking about something here that I’ve <em>never</em> really seen outside of Discord channels and chat-rooms.</p>

<p>A community-wide sort of event that happens every Sunday at 9pm eastern standard time.</p>

<p>A cheesy horror or monster movie is chosen, usually from anywhere between the forties, fifties, and sixties (and maybe sometimes the seventies and eighties), and then everyone who <em>wants to</em>, loads up the movie at the aforementioned time, and the fediverse turns into a waterfall of a huge amount of people posting to the #monsterdon hashtag their impressions and witticisms about whatever movie they all happen to be watching in that given week. Jesus, that was a hell of a run-on sentence.</p>

<p>I participated in it once so far, and then every subsequent time its happened since, <em>I forget, and forget, and forget</em>. But I do peek in every once in a while, when it happens, and I’m suddenly reminded that I forgot to participate. And … it’s kind of amazing?</p>

<p>In the past decade, social media has transformed into this thing where people are target searching. They’re looking for someone to dunk, looking for someone to use for engagement and five minutes of fame. Looking for things they hate so that they can react, and reaffirm to their followers that their opinions are the correct and best opinions to have.</p>

<p>In <em>some</em> cases, this is kind of exaggerated and not nearly as bad as it sounds. Taking a stand against injustice is <em>good</em>, even if there <em>are</em> people out there using these things for their own personal gain and fame. But, I’m trying to reinforce that, over all these years, a lot of social media has turned into this negative experience that most of us are <em>heavily</em> addicted to. No matter how bad the car crash, ya just can’t stop looking at it. The mangled metal, the broken glass, it’s like candy for the brain-juice. Uh … or maybe people don’t really look at a car crash like that, but you get what I mean!</p>

<p>And then you stumble into Mastodon, or the fediverse, and every Sunday there’s just people watching a dang movie. They’re not fighting, not spitting bile, just … enjoying something … together! In a fully digital space, where I’m <em>assuming</em> most people don’t even know each other!</p>

<p>It kind of reinforces this idea that the fediverse is the old web, reborn. The social web, resurrected. I <em>definitely</em> would’ve expected to see something like this on MySpace, if that sort of thing would’ve been possible back then. But definitely not on Twitter, or any of those other sites that are less about being social, and more about capital gains. And with all of the definitely <em>bad</em> things happening in the world, it’s just kind of nice to see totally normal and cool things happening. Totally nice things that definitely don’t suck.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this post just to say, keep it up! Let’s do more of this in different ways!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I didn’t really try to write a click-baity headline for this post.

Part of that is because my day job highly makes me feel like I don’t want to do <em>anything</em> when I get out of work. The other part of it, is that I spent hours and hours refreshing and updating the look and feel of my site (it’s cooler now). Now that I’ve done that, I’d like to write about Vivaldi.</p>

<p>A little while ago I wrote about the <a href="/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai">on-going blunders of the Mozilla Foundation</a>, and their head-long dive into AI, and the manipulation of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-search-update/" target="_blank">hiding data hijacking</a> within features that promise privacy. Basically, Mozilla needs money, and they’re selling their souls in order to get it.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and you <em>just want a good browser</em> that doesn’t have a ton of bloat, that isn’t taking your private data and selling it to some corporation, or what-have-you, then you already know what you need.</p>

<p><em>A better browser.</em></p>

<p>Firefox has been my go-to for a <em>long</em> time. It’s a decent browser! But, if I decide I want to actually interact with AI, I <em>don’t need it embedded in frikken’ Firefox</em>. And I don’t think this is where their resources, their time, and their effort should be going.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve switched to Vivaldi. A browser I <em>think</em> I’ve heard of before, but never really used? Never-the-less, I was pretty surprised when I finally did. I mean, right off the bat, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/" target="_blank">they’ve pledged</a> <em>not</em> to dedicate resources to integrate AI into their browser. Which, for all intents and purposes, that’s all you gotta say!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such, it does not feel right to bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a very hard-no on AI generated “art.” Ripping people off in order to funnel money into people’s pockets, who’ve done nothing but write a sentence, is the epitome of evil and greed. Using regular AI to generate text, or books, or anything of the sort, is definitely the <em>same kind</em> of plagiarist evil. But, I <em>will</em> acknowledge that there can be <em>some</em> uses in regard to AI chat bots … even though the power consumption is just as bad, or <em>worse</em> than the blockchain and NFTs. So, I find it <em>really</em> hard to justify using them. I <em>have</em>, though. I’ve asked an AI for some ideas on writing prompts to get my juices flowing. I’ve used an AI over my phone at work to help customers when I don’t know the answer to, “What kind of battery do I need for a Ford Pinto 1992, 4 cylinder, special edition, Pro Max?” And it has helped.</p>

<p>I will admit, and be transparent, in that I have personally found <em>some</em> use in these things. But I also ask myself, “Could I have just found this information on a search engine that isn’t mired by crud? Could I have done it without using a machine that’s on its way to being hooked up to a nuclear reactor twenty miles away from me?”</p>

<p>But, all of that’s beside my point in this article, in that, Vivaldi <em>isn’t</em> going to put this stuff into their browser. And they’re not <em>ignoring</em> their userbase in order to do whatever they want, for profit, and for violation of privacy. And that’s a big breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>And <em>all of this</em> is completely aside from the absolutely <em>cool as hell</em> features Vivaldi has built-in.</p>

<p>The browser … AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKS ADS! You don’t need an extension! IT WORKS ON YOUTUBE. You can just view websites, ad-free, by … opening your web browser? Holy crap.</p>

<p>Of course, you have customization options, sync options, theme options, password and bookmark import and saving, and so on and so forth. But what I’ve found <em>really</em> useful, is the right-side bar that you can <em>connect to your Apple calendar</em>, and the RSS feed aggregator that you can just plug some RSS into, and see updates from all the blogs you read, live, right there on the side of your browser. There’s a translate button, a note button, a reminders button, a button that opens their personal Vivaldi Mastodon instance, and <em>so much more</em>.</p>

<p>It’s the end-all, be-all of browsers, and I cannot believe that this isn’t some super famous, extremely well-known browser and company that’s taking the entire world by storm … <strong><em>Because they should be.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to write about how impressed I am with the Vivaldi browser. I can’t say I’m too sure what’s going on with the Social Web Foundation, but what that entails for sure remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I think you should <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">give it a go</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a couple of days since I’ve written anything.

<p>You might notice that the store location has changed <em>again</em>, but let me explain. The current location is a backup that I’ve had for a little over a month, in the event that I would have to move from the location that was provided to me.

<p>Thankfully, this won’t really affect the store, because it’ll now just be at my fully Backrooms/Pool Rooms themed location. And although the size may be deceiving, I actually have plenty of <em>space</em> to work with.</p>

To say that I’m a bit pissed off is an understatement.</p>

<p>So, let’s get straight to the vomit from the horse’s mouth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content in the grand scheme of this,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, which coincides with Meta’s annual Connect event. “My guess is that there are going to be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable.” But if creators are concerned or object, “when push comes to shove, if they demanded that we don’t use their content, then we just wouldn’t use their content. It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this point forward, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a> will be suspending any and all interaction with Threads.net. I won’t tell others what to do, but I’ve been teetering on this decision for a while. There are cool and decent people on Threads, but it’s just not worth it.</p>

<p>A billionaire thinks all of your thoughts, your memories, your written and graphical work and design … <em>isn’t worth shit.</em></p>

<p>But, it must be worth a hell of a lot if you’re feeding it into your sludge machine so that you can generate some glossy garbage that sucks ass, am I wrong?</p>

<p>Either way, I’m going to do what I should’ve done months ago, and I’m gonna Zuck the Zuck.</p>

<p>Go to hell, Meta.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.” Are the words of a man giving every writer, developer, creator, and artist a big, bold middle finger.</p>

<p>Those are all the words I have to give right now, and it’s exactly the right amount.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I, regrettably, have to talk about this by quoting from The Verge, but a couple of hours ago they published a talk with the Zuck on Meta’s AI, and the training data associated with it.

Basically, this group of companies and corporations who are banding together to throw their hats together as a supporting web to build up ActivityPub and the Fediverse. Except … It reads and feels a lot like, “We made this.”</p>

<p>As some may know, I’ve written about Mastodon, all of its diverse software, ActivityPub, and the Fediverse <em>quite</em> frequently. I even wrote a <a class="page-link" href="/pages/activitypub">little bit of a beginner’s guide</a> to jumping in, which also features some <em>history</em>. History that is entirely missing from TSWF.</p>

<p>My first question to all of this would be: Who <em>exactly</em> asked for this? The Fediverse, as mentioned in my guide, has existed since 2008, <em>without</em> corporate or moneyed influence.</p>

<p>Quoted from their mission page,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fediverse cannot thrive without people building clients or running providers. And to do those things, they need money. Whether that’s advertising supported, or funded by charities and non-profits, or based on paid-for services, or affiliate revenue, we are working to find ways that companies can do well in the Fediverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a majority of the people who populate the Fedi, we don’t <em>care</em> if companies are doing well across the protocol. It wasn’t <em>built for them.</em> And it should remain that way.</p>

<p>Yes, I run my own instance. No, I don’t make <em>any</em> money from it. And if I ever <em>did</em>, it would be entirely up to future potential users who want to support mkultra.monster. But, until then, it’s run entirely out-of-pocket, and <em>I’m okay with that</em>. I chose to do this, and I’m running a hosted service that caps out at a certain amount of users. And I’m also okay with that! I have no interest in running a social media platform that’s populated by one hundred million people.</p>

<p>Now, there are a lot of companies and non-profits coming together on this page, companies, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flipboard</li>
  <li>Automattic</li>
  <li>Meta</li>
  <li>Ghost</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>IFTAS</li>
  <li>Write.as</li>
  <li>Fastly</li>
  <li>Vivaldi</li>

<p>So, it kinda makes sense that writing platforms want to get in on ActivityPub and the Fediverse. But I feel a little uneasy about Automattic getting <em>too</em> involved. Their CEO is a <em>major</em> douche-nozzle, who once had a meltdown over a joke on Tumblr, and just recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/wp-engine-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-automattic-over-mullenwegs-comments/?guccounter=1" target="_blank">slandered a Wordpress provider</a> <em>for no reason</em>.</p>

<p>Vivaldi makes more sense to me, even though they’re a web browser provider. But, their words on the matter are actually aligned with what many people across the Fediverse believe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Fediverse reminds us of the early days of the Web. We are competing against silos and corporate interests, using a W3C-based open standard and a distributed solution,” says Jon Von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi (<a href="https://social.vivaldi.net/@jon" target="_blank">@jon@vivaldi.net</a>). “It’s great that social networking companies are supporting the Fediverse, and Vivaldi is pleased to support the Social Web Foundation so that we can once again have a town square free of algorithms and corporate control.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes <em>absolutely no sense</em> when you put these words and these developers <em>right next</em> to Meta, and Threads.</p>

<p>I’ve spoken <em>a lot</em> about Threads. I feel like, if you’re an instance provider on the Fedi, it’s entirely up to you whether you want to federate with them or not. But let’s not forget, Meta is a corporation. One of the <em>richest</em> corporations in the world, who definitely have <em>corporate</em> interests when it comes to social media, the web, and <em>ActivityPub</em>.</p>

<p>On top of that, it has been almost an entire <em>year</em>, and they still have not fully integrated federation on Threads. As it stands right now, likes and comments coming from the Fediverse show up as additional links you have to click multiple times in order to see, <em>while on Threads</em>. It’s a very tacked-on, a very, “These people aren’t Threads users, but here they are if you <em>really</em> want to see them” kind of gesture. Right now, its mostly superficial, and it rubs me the wrong way. It makes me feel like they <em>don’t</em> have any intention of <em>true</em> integration.</p>

<p>Not mentioned, but included in the list, are Mastodon and Pixelfed. These are, <em>at least</em>, entities that have been involved for a long time, and are partially responsible for the Fediverse becoming just a little bit more mainstream than it was before.</p>

<p>But where’s the mention of Akkoma, Pleroma, GNU Social, Freindika, Misskey, <strong><em>Peertube</em></strong>, and so on, and so forth? Are we just going to ignore them into the ether?</p>

<p>The Fediverse is home to something like … 15 million people or so (not that much more than Bluesky, and with this news, bsky devs are probably sharting themselves)? And it’s only growing as users on Threads turn on federation. But if companies and corporations can’t see themselves as part of the Fediverse without injecting money, sponsors, and ads into it, <em>then they should get out, and stay out.</em> The internet is <em>overrun</em> with sludge-content designed to waste your time and steal your attention for someone else’s financial gain. Rebuilding the open web is completely and entirely about escaping all of that, <em>for good</em>. It’s about bringing back the days of <em>people</em>, building their own spaces, having their own ideas and conversations free of algorithms and corporate influence.</p>

<p>To want to interfere in that, and possibly even <em>destroy</em> it, well. Maybe I <em>should</em> full-block Threads, and other corporate entrances into the Fediverse via my instance.</p>

<p>I really don’t know right now.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, kind of just completely out-of-the-blue, this thing called “The Social Web Foundation” launched.

It’s <em>basically</em> almost all I know. You know, aside from those times I launched a GNU Social instance, and then a very short-lived Pleroma instance. GNU Social is a lot like if someone made an open source Facebook, and Pleroma is okay, but it was originally made by <em>a terrible person</em> (not that this should stop you from doing whatever you want, with your time, and servers).</p>

<p>Then there was Misskey. Something I never really explored all that much, because the flagship instance, based in Japan, <em>outright</em> bans western users from even so much as <em>registering</em> on the instance. I tried to look up reasons as to why this is so, and all I could really find were reactionary Americans saying, “It’s because woke bad, and Japan don’t not no like that, bro?”</p>

<p>But, like other pieces of fediverse/activitypub software, Misskey’s got some forks. A lot of forks.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/sharkey/matrix-gun.gif" alt="an animated gif from the scene in The Matrix where Neo and Trinity are in a blank white room, and infinite racks of guns race up to them." />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure <em>why</em> this is, but that’s the beauty of open source software. You can jack a piece of it for yourself, and then completely rework it to fit your wants and needs.</p>

<p>Enter: <a href="https://activitypub.software/TransFem-org/Sharkey#findaninstance" target="_blank">Sharkey</a>.</p>

<p>I was trying to find a comprehensive reason as to <em>why</em> Misskey was forked, and then transformed into Sharkey, but mostly all I could really find was this general statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sharkey is a Misskey fork following upstream changes when possible, with added features. Like any other ActivityPub software Sharkey can interface with the thousands of servers that form the fediverse, an interconnected social network, working in tandem with software such as Akkoma, Mastodon, Pixelfed and many more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is fine! I’ll also note that Sharkey seems to be centered around trans-feminine users and themes, which is also cool.</p>

<p>The fediverse, at least on the Mastodon side, kind of has this reputation that it’s full of, and <em>made for</em> tech geek dude type people. Which, I’ve detailed before, was really only the case back in like, 2016. I’d say <em>now</em>, as in 2024, the fediverse overall is very populated by the LGBTQ+ community, and all sorts of people and walks-of-life, in-general.</p>

<p>But what’s it like?</p>

<p>Oh, it’s cool. It’s <em>pretty</em> cool.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/sharkey/sharkey.png" alt="A screenshot of my feed on a Sharkey instance, showcasing all the columns and many buttons and options you can utilize." />
</center>
<p><i>Names in the notification tab blurred in order to preserve privacy.</i>
<br /></p>

<p>Right away, you can see that this is a hell of a lot not like Mastodon <em>at all</em>. You’ve got the ability to post, of course, but you have <em>full control</em> over the UI, everything can be customized, trending topics update <em>live</em>, all of your files are able to be seen in an account-based “drive,” and did I mention you could have all the links you want on your profile page?</p>

<p>And, I feel like one of the main draws of Misskey and its forks, are the many, <em>many</em> emoji reactions you can use on posts that readily replace the tired old fave button.</p>

<p>So, basically, it’s kind of like Mastodon, but it’s more fun, and heavily customizable.</p>

<p>In fact, I feel Misskey is really aiming for self expression, and appealing to creative types.</p>

<p>My dilemma, is that I like this <em>so much</em> that I kind of want to use it more than my <em>own</em> instance, and I’ve even considered halting payments on a Mastodon server, and just migrating everything I do to the Sharkey instance I’m on, because … why not!?</p>

<p>But, at the same time, my Mastodon instance has a really sweet domain (the same one this website uses), and I’ve been using it for about a year now. I just don’t know for sure if I want to abandon that. Even if I decided to move the domain to my own hosted Sharkey instance, I’d still <em>lose</em> some data in that process. Not my posts though. Every <em>single thing</em> I’ve ever posted on my instance is copied and backed-up in a Google drive document.</p>

<p>Whatever I end up choosing to do with my time and my posting, you should check out Sharkey for yourself! Here are some instances to check out:</p>

</ul>

<p>You can check out more instances, <a href="https://fedidb.org/software/sharkey" target="_blank">here</a>, but I <em>highly</em> recommend investigating them before face-planting your keyboard and hitting that join button. Like with all fediverse software, it’s all run by regular people. And some regular people are … <em>not using fediverse software for good things</em> (I don’t want to be the reason you accidentally join a server for Nazis that everyone, their Mom, and admin have blocked, suspended, and silenced).</p>

<p>Otherwise, thanks for reading! I look forward to exploring <em>even more</em> of the fediverse, eight years on!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the longest time, I’ve spent most of my fediverse posting hours on the Mastodon software.

This lasted into 2014, and I am at least <em>semi</em> certain I started using Spotify for this. How I did before that time … I think I must’ve been using Winamp to track things I was listening to.</p>

<p>Yes. That’s it.</p>

<p>Then I eventually created a new account for my musical presence under <em>Eyeshadow 2600 FM</em> and scrobbled into the 30,000s, and, like with my original account, eventually stopped doing this, as well. I also don’t really have any interest in reviving the ES2600FM Last.fm account, but that’s more to do with the piss-poor online synthwave community than anything (bullying, harassment, stalking, black-listing, etc).</p>

<p>Now we’ll snap into 2024, like a time machine, and I’m back at it again scrobbling on Last.fm, because it’s <em>much</em> simpler to do now. But, I’m mostly doing this because I found this little open source project that’s <em>like</em> Last.fm, but more like an entire open-web social media network of your listening habits, a Wiki that documents <em>every song ever</em>, and even an app you can use on your PC to submit meta-data to their database.</p>

<p>It’s honestly pretty wild, and I only discovered it because of a side-account I made via the Fediverse on <a href="https://kitsunes.club/@foxx_nova" target="_blank">kitsunes.club</a>. Have I mentioned that Sharkey (a misskey fork) is really cool, and I’m <em>half</em> considering using it as a primary and dropping the costs of hosting my own instance (I’m still not sure about this, though, because I <em>have</em> to have some kind of account on a Mastodon server, if only to at least have a place to link my posts here so that I can have comments)?</p>

<p>But anyway, the database is at <a href="https://musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">MusicBrainz</a>, and once you’ve made an account there, you can head over to <a href="https://listenbrainz.org" target="_blank">ListenBrainz</a>, and then connect all of your music-listening apps. By doing this, you can scrobble to Last.fm, <em>and</em> directly to ListenBrainz, where your tastes, history, listening trends and habits all become part of this little … social network of <em>everyone’s</em> listening habits. It’s, again, really <em>cool</em>.</p>

<p>If you’ve gotten past all of that, and you <em>still</em> want more, and <em>also</em> have a digital music collection just sitting on your PC collecting dust, you can then grab <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org" target="_blank">Picard</a>, and catalogue your collection from your hard drive directly to MusicBrainz.</p>

<p>The best part about all of this, is that it can be <em>mostly</em> entirely automatic, requiring little input from the user, depending on <em>what</em> you use for music.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend anyone who regularly listens to music to give all of this a try, and also <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/user/foxx_nova" target="_blank">follow me</a> on ListenBrainz! Let’s compare our musical taste!</p>

<p>Anything that makes it feel like it’s still 2000 to 2010 internet is a-okay in my book.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in 2012, and I don’t even remember how I went about it, I spent enormous amounts of time scrobbling my music listening habits to Last.fm.

To top it off, they’ve done this <em>before</em> altering their terms of service. So, technically, nobody’s agreed to this. But! We all know the people behind large learning models <em>absolutely</em> do not know what consent is.</p>

<p>Real quick, how to turn it off:</p>

<p>Click “Me” at the top, then go to “Settings and Privacy,” then click the “Data Privacy” tab. I want to note how <em>hilarious</em> it is to have a tab called “Data Privacy” where they’re automatically taking all of your data to sell to the highest bidder, and to feed into Microsoft’s plagiarism machines. But anyway … then click, “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and then toggle that off.</p>

<p>Problem solved!</p>

<p>But, honestly? <em>Who the heck</em> uses LinkedIn? The last time I seriously attempted to use the site as a social network, I felt like I should’ve been compensated for my time, you know, <em>paid</em>. I felt like I should’ve gone to work the next day and filled out a time adjustment just for logging into the Founder Zone.</p>

<p>Surely there’s a better way to go about advertising what you can do and who you are to the world, where your thoughts can stream independently and <em>not</em> be Zucked up by some kind of machine that’s melting the ice caps, right?</p>

<p>Everything you can do on LinkedIn, you can accomplish by building a portfolio, having a resume, and posting on normal social media regularly by sometimes showcasing your skills, and asking about job opportunities. This happens on the fediverse <em>all of the time</em>. <strong><em>Yes, I am once again suggesting you <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers" target="_blank">Join Mastodon</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>You don’t need a social network where everyone is talking in customer service voice and never allowing their minds a break from work-life.</p>

<p>And, I mean, for sure, it goes without saying …</p>

<p>Microsoft’s version of AI is pretty inescapable, despite measures I’ve taken by … using Linux on my main machine, having an iPhone (which will now have an opt-in AI feature), and shelving my Xbox. But, this website is also fed through Github in order to be built, and deployed, and I <em>do</em> still keep some old files on Microsoft’s cloud drive.</p>

<p>Whichever way you look at it, you’ve <em>already</em> been scraped by billionaires who should have paid you for your time, energy, and data. And, maybe someday they’ll be <em>forced to</em>.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean you should subject yourself to LinkedIn, and allow Microsoft to take <em>even more</em> of your data. In the open web, I call that <em>self harm</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven’t heard by now, LinkedIn suddenly implemented a “feature” into their social network that automatically opts you into allowing them to use all of your data for AI training.
