Except this time it marches forward with <a href="https://krafton.com/en/more-experience/ai/" target="_blank">Krafton’s enthusiastic destruction of the arts</a> with it’s latest and highly anticipated life-sim, InZoi. Thought to be a “Sims killer,” the game launches as an ultra-realistic sim that <em>immediately</em> shoves generative sludge into your face. Because having artists who make designs for clothing in your game is too hard, and having less ways to get involved in game development is definitely the future we’re all rooting for (sarcasm).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Krafton is very open about its pro-AI advocacy – it has a whole section of its website dedicated to its Deep Learning division, which works to use generative AI to “increase game productivity” by generating art, animation, and voices, translating research into real-world tools, creating “Virtual Friends” you can play games with and talk to, virtual influencers that can livestream games, and probably more that isn’t stated on the website.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Quoted from <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-inzois-use-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank">thegamer.com</a>.</em></p>

<p>Wow, that’s a lot of horrible things to shotgun all at once!</p>

<p>But, don’t worry, they’re only using things people made for free, or work that they’ve already had done for them by actual artists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All AI features within InZOI utilize proprietary models developed by Krafton and are trained using solely company-owned and copyright issue-free assets and data,” Suri explains. “In addition, inZOI’s AI capabilities are built into the client as on-device solutions and therefore do not make communications online with external servers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Quoted from <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/inzoi/generative-ai" target="_blank">pcgamesn.com.</a></em></p>

<p>As if it <em>somehow</em> makes it seem better, to announce that you’re outsourcing jobs in your company to an algorithmic machine that’s choking the atmosphere, but with things people didn’t ask for money for, or things you’ve already paid actual human beings to make.</p>

<p>Okay, I get it. I’m cynical, and sick-to-death of talking about this. But, all across social media, or, at least, <em>corporate</em> social media, there are endless people thoughtlessly Ghibli-ifying themselves, or clamoring about how great they think it is to use a hallucinating chatbot as a replacement for critical thinking, and now that same brain-drain garbage is leaking into an art form.</p>

<p>I don’t have much hope for the world. I don’t have much hope for art. I <em>lost</em> hope in most people a long time ago.</p>

<p>But, if you’re like me, and you’re sick of this trash, join my club. The Never-AI-in-My-Damn-Games club, and don’t buy this. Don’t buy anything by any developers or studios who’ve decided that having artists isn’t productive enough, or a waste of money.</p>

<p>Let them burn.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="ai" /><category term="inzoi" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like I thought, the slow-creep of generative AI into gaming continues.

This still pales in comparison to what it costs to have a whole entire PC, but hold up a second. Not only will the console cost you 500 dollars, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank">the digital edition of games will be 80 dollars, and the physical copies wil be 90 USD</a>, on a case-by-case basis (apparently). As we all know, the last studio that did something like this, caused a cascade that made nearly <em>every new title</em> 70 bucks. But, there’s something <em>all of them</em> are ignoring.</p>

<p>It’s quickly becoming apparent that owning a PC <em>or</em> a console is something only people with extra, or <em>lots</em> of money will be doing, in the extreme near future. <em>Especially</em> if Nintendo is successful in pushing standard edition games to 80 and 90 dollars. As if we’re all made of money while the economy is tanking far past the toilet, and into hell itself.</p>

<p>But, I remember a time when I used to buy multiple games per month. Now I buy a single game every couple months, or maybe two if I’m feeling like I don’t care. Maybe more if they go on sale at steep discounts.</p>

<p>This isn’t how it used to be.</p>

<p>But, I wanted to talk less about the rising prices of games without any thought for the people who buy them (because who cares if we price out an entire class of people from an art form), and more about the <em>thing</em> that all of these studios and publishers are ignoring.</p>

<p>You can play perfectly fun, good, and highly detailed games <em>on your phone</em>, and … <em>for free</em>.</p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p>We’re no longer in the era of Candy Crush being a staple of mobile gaming.</p>

<p>You can play <em>Call of Duty</em> on your phone, without spending a single dime. Which is <em>hilarious</em>. The studio that brought you microtransaction-shooter-hell, that releases with a new title every 6 months at 70 to 100 bucks, also gave you a way to play the <em>same exact thing, for free, on your phone</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can play a game that’s basically a copy-paste of Breath of the Wild, for FREE (Genshin Impact).</p>

<p>Don’t like either of those?</p>

<p>Phones got Minecraft, also. And it’s free.</p>

<p>Or maybe you’d prefer Runescape.</p>

<p>No? How about the entire native Warframe experience?</p>

<p>Or even PUBG!</p>

<p>The thing is, I think a lot of these studios are banking on the idea that most gamers (see: people who play games) <em>don’t take phone gaming seriously</em>. But, why shouldn’t they?</p>

<p>You can whip out a cheap adapter, and plug an HDMI cable <strong>into a 200 dollar Android</strong>, and play <strong>on your TV, with a wireless controller</strong>.</p>

<p>Or, you know, you can just … hold your phone, and play while laying down, on your back, in your comfy bed, and pop off forty straight kills in a CoD team deathmatch.</p>

<p>But hey.</p>

<p><em>Hey.</em></p>

<p>Maybe you would prefer to spend 150 dollars on the next Call of Duty title for your 700 dollar console. Or your 2000 dollar PC.</p>

<p>Is it time to take mobile gaming seriously?</p>

<p>Bro, most of us are <em>already</em> taking it seriously.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="nintendo" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, just a few days ago, it was announced that the Switch 2 will be nearly 500 dollars.

That thing being, Minecraft ARGs, or “alternate reality games.” Wherein, some user will post, or say they’re “reposting” something from over a decade ago, of a strange series of videos, from a near vacant Youtube account. And then as you watch said videos, there’s a string of creepy, horrific, or sad things that happen as this “Youtuber” plays through Minecraft (and each video will usually have clues or hidden links, etc).</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “The hell? You’re almost 40, right? Minecraft is for KIDS!”</p>

<p>Maybe you’re not thinking that.</p>

<p>But, I <em>do</em> think it sometimes, to myself. Mostly, because I was an alpha-buy-in for the original Minecraft, and I have definitely noted the extreme family-friendly shift the game made over the last decade. Not that this is <em>hugely</em> a problem, or anything. I still very much enjoy logging onto my realm and figuring out how exactly to make my base not be really basic and boring.</p>

<p>Anyway!</p>

<p>There are two Minecraft ARGs that really stick out to me as extremely well done. At least, of what I’ve watched so far. But, I don’t go through the whole game of picking through videos, and figuring out what’s going on. I just watch someone do it for me.</p>

<p>But, the first one isn’t really an ARG, it’s more like a short film.</p>

<p>And it’s great.</p>

<p>This one is a dive into a short Minecraft film called “ABANDONED.” Which is in the style of something of a “let’s play” sort of deal, except the player’s Minecraft world is … haunted. With commentary from the Youtube channel, trone(y)sauce (because this is how <em>I</em> stumbled upon it, and I didn’t really object to having commentary and a dissection of what happened).</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdV73N_PmZo?si=wlDtB5LS5znWy7d5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Now, this didn’t really scare me or anything, it was just <em>really</em> interesting to watch. Because, I’ve never seen people do things like this with Minecraft.</p>

<p>I thought it was all just semi-weird-ish adults doing exaggerated Let’s Plays for kids.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>After you’re done watching that one, you <em>absolutely have</em> to watch, “My Minecraft World is Deleting Itself …”</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5HVis7SmP4?si=HXnQhPnLnSXdKEDU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This one <em>is</em> an ARG, and I also watched it from another Youtuber’s perspective, as they themselves explain all of the details. And, this one isn’t really scary or anything either. It’s, actually, a really sad story.</p>

<p>But, I’ll let you watch it and figure out for yourself if you can come to the conclusion on what it’s about before Wifies explains it for you, at the end.</p>

<p>Again, this is content that’s just revolving around Minecraft. I would have never expected to find things like this, and I can’t wait to see if there’s anymore!</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="minecraft" /><category term="args" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In continuing my new trend of just yapping, I wanted to point out something that I’ve been kind of enjoying lately (especially since quality Backrooms Youtube content has kind of dried up for me).

They thought I was simply releasing music and ignoring everything else.</p>

<p>Well, this is on-going and continuing proof that I do buy, and also listen to music. Especially nowadays, as my album creation process is <em>much, much slower</em> than it used to be.</p>

<p>Up first! We have …</p>

<p><em>Whitewoods</em>, <a href="https://mypetflamingo.bandcamp.com/album/spaceship-earth" target="_blank">Spaceship Earth</a>. I grabbed this album, because it sounded like a mixture of new wave pop-punk and synth-y vaporwave, which, I think, is <em>exactly what it is</em>.</p>

<p>Next up is, <em>t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者 and 猫シ Corp.</em>, <a href="https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/--45" target="_blank">テ​レ​パ​シ​ー​の</a>. Which is, for all intents and purposes, a <em>much more</em> traditional type of vaporwave. You’ve gotta have the traditional type, along with its variations. At least, <em>once</em>, in your Bandcamp shopping sprees.</p>

<p>I support vaporwave a lot more nowadays, because it sounds exactly like something you might hear while you’re lost in the Complex / Backrooms.</p>

<p>Third in today’s purchases, is <em>LAST CEREMONY</em>, <a href="https://businesscasual87.bandcamp.com/album/dial-up-daydreams" target="_blank">DIAL-UP-DAYDREAMS</a>. This is some more mega-vapor tunes, with a call-back to nineties internet surfing. Basically, all you need to do in order to get me to buy your album, is to theme it around 90s internet. That’s it!</p>

<p>Fourth, is <em>glaciære</em>, with <a href="https://hiraeth-records.bandcamp.com/album/pool-water-blue" target="_blank">pool water blue</a>. A very <em>dreamy</em>, vaporwave, kind of liminal space sounding album, with definite eighties synthwave influences mixed within. Listening to this, only a few tracks in, it’s a <em>must buy</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t really buy anything that’s purely “eighties synthwave” much anymore, mostly due-in-part to the way a lot of the people in that music community treated me. But, I do still listen to and enjoy its influences.</p>

<p>And, <em>finally</em>, what would a Bandcamp shopping spree be if I didn’t buy, <em>Mabisyo</em>, with <a href="https://mabisyo.bandcamp.com/album/sun-colored-eyes" target="_blank">Sun Colored Eyes</a>. This is the second Mabisyo album I’ve grabbed, and, just like the first time, this is <em>professional grade</em> dreamy vapor-synth. And, while a lot of these albums have obvious influences from Japan, and its music (think lo-fi j-pop), this is definitely one of the most notable.</p>

<p>That’s it for now! I could probably go on an infinite shopping spree and just grab <em>every single thing</em> that catches my eye, but my bank account wouldn’t like that much. So, we’ll save the next 5 albums I buy for either my next payday, or next month. Or, maybe May’s Bandcamp Friday? We’ll see!</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Music" /><category term="music" /><category term="albums" /><category term="bandcamp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I decided I wanted to write about albums I buy on Bandcamp, partly because when I was still being extremely, over-the-top prolific about making music back on Twitter (before the twitter-synthwave community effectively excommunicated me due to a large portion of them being extremely bigoted), some didn’t think I was buying any music.

If you’ve been following my little journey in hollowing out a piece of the internet that isn’t annoying, dominated by corporations, and their engagement tricks, you’ve likely seen me popping up this website, erecting a phpBB forum, and you’ve probably also noticed that people all over the place are making GeoCities-ish type websites for fun! Well, the revival of the old-net goes even deeper than that.</p>

<p>Ever since Meta turned on Facebook, things have gotten worse, and worse. MySpace got sold off and changed into something completely different (a janky website for bands???). AOL Instant Messenger went offline, <em>for good</em>. Twitter plopped into the ether, Tumblr became a replacement for LiveJournal, and then for a decade everyone only visited four websites.</p>

<p>That was … until people got tired of the algorithms, and the disingenuous content of people and corps who use social media to pump stats and shun actual social interaction.</p>

<p>Out came Mastodon on the ActivityPub network, and, although ActivityPub existed for <em>a long time</em> before Mastodon’s rise, I feel like <em>this</em> is exactly where people started rebuilding, for <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>You see, the internet is a lot like space. You can build a wall. You can put up a ton of interstellar checkpoints that flash a million ads in your face as you navigate around each system. But, as soon as people realize that space is not a two dimensional plane, and that they can just, fly in a different direction, things start to change.</p>

<p>AOL Instant Messenger, reborn!</p>

<p>Exactly a year ago today, the <a href="https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server" target="_blank">Retro AIM Server</a> repo appeared on Github. A project that effectively open sourced the AOL Instant Messenger servers. In that, <em>you</em>, or <em>anyone</em>, can just host a server that people can use the <em>actual</em> old software to connect to.</p>

<p>But you don’t need to do all of that.</p>

<p>All you need to do is use the links in the repo to download AIM to your system of choice. I’m on Linux, so I had to use Wine to open it. No biggie.</p>

<p>Then, you need a server, right?</p>

<p>I gotchu.</p>

<p>All you’ve got to do is <a href="https://sso.chivanet.org" target="_blank">go here</a>, and create an account. Then, in the AIM section, create your username and password.</p>

<p>You’re done!</p>

<p>Open the original AIM client, follow the instructions from the repo that tell you where to put your connection info, and sign on!</p>

<p>You’re back, or, if you were born in the 2000s, you’re here for the first time!</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> issue, is this is not something that’s on a billion person network. So … having buddies will not be something you … <em>have</em>, right away. But, that’s okay, because you can have me as your first buddy. My AIM name is Atomleiche.</p>

<p>Just click the “+/- setup” button on the bottom right, then click “add buddy” and type in my username. Then confirm it. If I’m online, you’ll hear the sound of a door opening, and then you can just double-click me and send a message!</p>

<p>It’s that simple!</p>

<p>And this is how it worked back on the old-net. You added buddies, and then when they came online, it was time chat. Or not! Some people would just add me back in the day to expand their list, I think. Who knows. But I had a whole lot of buddies, who I’m sure have completely different lives now. Maybe none of them think about this stuff anymore. Maybe they do!</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>But, I feel like this is still only the beginning.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="internet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Queue Inception bwam sound.

Not because there’s <em>nothing</em> to write about, but more-so that everything I <em>could</em> write about is mostly negative. Negative, like me visiting the forum I’ve endorsed over and over again (Melonland), and speaking out against the pro-AI users and their bad ideas, and then subsequently being moderated by <em>Melooon themselves</em>, is … discouraging, to say the least.</p>

<p>Read more on that, <a href="https://labyrinth.zone/notice/AsSifF0crLJyf1gsbI" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve since, unfortunately, scrubbed all mention of Melonland from this website. Not going to support someone (and their projects) who thinks it’s bad form to say, “These people should be mocked and shunned.”</p>

<p>And then I go on Bluesky, and it’s just a continual waterfall of “Laurelai Bailey this, Laurelai Bailey that,” as it goes, because she keeps gaining influence on every new platform that crops up, and apparently there’s nothing anyone can do about it. Due-in-part to the fact that the newest generation of trans people <em>have no idea who she is</em>, or any idea at all about the numerous crimes she’s committed, starting from sexual assault, years-long efforts in gaslighting and manipulating people, all the way up to divulging information to the FBI, and working hand-in-hand with admitted neo nazis, and sexual predators.</p>

<p>But, instead of deep-diving into either of these topics, I just want to summarize the last three days, before I’m shoved back into offline work, and my time is taken up by all of that, plus sleeping and being exhausted for the following next three days.</p>

<p>So, as you know, I’ve launched a forum over at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">forums.mkultra.monster</a>. And there are many potential topics to engage in. I’ll be subsequently adding different things to the forum, as I write, and do <em>stuff</em>, as a way to document and archive <em>what</em> I’m doing, and also to encourage users to join, and start up a conversation.</p>

<p>This <em>may</em> be the hard part, but I’m mostly happy that I finally decided to <em>just make the forum</em> I’ve been wanting to make, whether people will use it or not.</p>

<p>I also took a whole bunch of painstaking hours, and added custom thumbnail images <em>to every single</em> forum, so that each has their own little dash of flavor.</p>

<p>The only issue I’m working through now, is that e-mail authentication and sending for accounts, <em>does not work at all</em>. I’ve tried using SendGrid’s SMTP credentials, and even Google’s SMTP credentials.</p>

<p>So far, this has resulted in … <em>Nothing</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you don’t <em>need</em> e-mail authentication to sign up, but, you <em>will</em> need to remember your password, since the only way to recover it is via e-mail. Which currently does not work.</p>

<p>I’ll be investigating via the official PHPBB forums to figure out why this is the one pain-point of putting together a forum.</p>

<p>Otherwise … that’s basically it! That’s how I’ve spent the past three days!</p>

<p>Basically, at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">MKULTRA Board</a>, I copy/pasted a <em>huge</em> part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010401015509/http://animeboards.com:80/" target="_blank">the old anime forum</a> I used to be part of back in 1999-2001 (somewhere in that era), and then added my own things.</p>

<p>I did this, because I’ve missed it greatly. So much so, that, <em>years back</em>, I contacted the original owner and asked if he’d be willing to part with the database and software, so that it could be resurrected. Unfortunately, if I recall, he wasn’t too interested in doing that, or felt like it would be too much of a hassle, or cost too greatly.</p>

<p>I don’t know about that. I’m running the new forum on a 16 dollar VPS, and it’s pretty smooth!</p>

<p>Now, obviously, if, <em>for some reason</em>, it attracts thousands of people, then <em>yes</em>, it would require much more in hosting.</p>

As people who care about artists and the work they do, we don’t generate sludge, and then also credit the theft machines that are making sludge for us, okay? But anyway, the article was about how we need to <em>save</em> discussion forums, and that Reddit and Discord are killing them (a conversation that feels ten years too late). But, <em>is it</em> too late to talk about this?</p>

<p>I’ve personally gone on tangents on here a few times already about how nostalgic I am for the era of the internet when people were less accessible, not <em>always around</em>, and the web was something you explored. How discussion forums were the <em>main</em> place you gathered to form communities, and that these places <em>weren’t</em> a thing with millions of people, but more like hundreds, and rarely, <em>sometimes</em>, thousands.</p>

<p>I’ve also talked about how one of my favorite forums to visit, the mirror of forums of yore, is <a href="https://forum.melonland.net" target="_blank">Melonland</a> (mostly for retro webdevs and community around that topic).</p>

<p>You might say, “What do you mean they’re dying? We have Discourse for modern forum software!”</p>

<p>But, I don’t <em>like</em> Discourse all that much. It doesn’t <em>feel</em> like a forum. It feels like … I don’t know. Something <em>else</em>, entirely.</p>

<p>It feels like modern webdevs who are constantly trying to modernize <em>every single</em> web system that has ever existed, as if <em>something was wrong</em> with the way things were once presented to us, online. There was nothing wrong with PHPBB. We don’t need forums that look like a Slack meeting.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/save-forums/discourse.png" /></p>

<p>Just like there was <em>nothing wrong</em> with AOL Instant Messenger. AOL <em>totally</em> could have continued developing it, with its current UI, to run much the same way Discord does. That would’ve been neat, huh?</p>

<p>But then Discord <em>did</em> come along, and with instant messaging, they brought servers, and with servers, they also brought channels that you can setup as some bastardized rip of what a forum is. <em>Channels</em>, that you can <em>post</em> to, and have slower discussion.</p>

<p>It does and still feels needless and also pointless.</p>

<p>But then you have Reddit, which has been a mainstay for … so many years. I think it was open to the public around … 2005? So, right around the time that Facebook started replacing MySpace, Reddit was replacing forums with one gigantic “frontpage of the internet” where millions would eventually gather to talk about any and all topics.</p>

<p>Essentially, <em>erasing</em> the need or <em>drive</em> to setup a discussion forum on your own domain, on your own server, for specific topics. Why do that, when you’ve got Reddit, where you can just create a community centered around whatever topic you’re interested in?</p>

<p>And that’s the overwhelming problem with the modern internet, and its many developers. We’re always trying to smash as many things as possible into one <em>thing</em>, under <em>one</em> roof.</p>

<p>Centralization is the anti-thesis of the <em>internet</em>. We <em>shouldn’t</em> put <em>everything</em> into one place, because, as you, the reader, have probably <em>already seen</em>, that doing so is catastrophic, when places like Twitter get bought out.</p>

<p>Not that I don’t <em>like</em> Reddit and its alternative federated clone, Lemmy, which, for all intents and purposes, does a better job at splitting up hosting and data shards. But … I do find myself asking, “Where have all the normal PHPBB forums gone?”</p>

<p>It’s an internet tragedy that the anime forum (that I link to via WayBackMachine at the bottom of the homepage) that I was on as a 16 year old has been dead for five years. Gone. Deleted. Never to be seen again. And, because of the way the WayBackMachine works, there’s <em>no way</em> to extract my old thoughts, my old posts … who <em>I was</em> when I was 16, and put it somewhere that won’t die and be erased.</p>

<p>Decentralization, though, people treat this like it’s a <em>new</em> idea, even though this is just how the internet worked back then. People did their <em>own</em> thing, there were websites for every topic, every interest, and a million discussion forums to cover those topics and interests. But, to save them?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t see a way through any of this where old-style, or discussion forums, in-general, will end up “saved.” I don’t see this happening in the present day, where “decentralization” is a buzzword corporations and crypto-bros use in order to garner interest in their next pump and dump.</p>

<p>While mass amounts of people are <em>happy</em> to continue posting on Twitter, or to move their posting to Threads under Meta, one of the <em>largest</em> and <em>most evil</em> central platforms in the world.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the average Joe <em>doesn’t care</em> about this stuff. You might care about it. I care about it. But what do two people matter, to a mass of millions who log onto the next central billionaire owned platform to post about the next foozeball game, and then log off, without a thought or care in the world? Even while said platforms <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/meta-new-hate-speech-rules-allow-users-call-lgbtq-people-mentally-ill-rcna186700" target="_blank">are stripping them of their right to not be harassed or hate-crimed</a>.</p>

<p>It’s almost like there’s this thing that’s been happening the past decade, like, some kind of … net split?</p>

<p>The net is splitting, between the hangers-on who know things can be better, and actively are <em>trying</em> to make them that way, and the people who just want to thought-dump, without a care for where they do it. Like a digital Great Wall, or Cyberpunk 2077’s Black Wall, I think there will be an underground web where people speak, communicate, and build for a more humane digital future, and then there’ll be the billion dollar platforms where people post shit like, “Who up? Gotta be on that grind bro, get that bread! $$$” and then log off.</p>

<p>Which, is a shame. Because it will be those people who ask the question, “Well, what do I do now?” When they lose their presence, data, and online identity the next time one of these billionaires has a mid-life crisis.</p>

<p>“But Nova, this is really pessimistic and uncharitable to most people!”</p>

<p>Yup, look what “most people” have done to the world.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Web" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="web" /><category term="community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading this article from [a website] that will not be named, since they used and credited Midjourney for images in their article, and we don’t do that.

At first glance, you’ll notice that she’s creating <em>many</em> accounts, <em>everywhere</em>. And this is probably the result of a script running on a VPS somewhere that’s creating accounts, and then sending messages via a headless browser that watches the federated network of an instance.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/fediverse-chick/nicole.png" /></p>

<p>But … the question is, why?</p>

<p>Surely, someone couldn’t <em>possibly</em> think that spamming millions of people, nonstop, for two years or more, is going to gain them any amount of positive clout, or follower-ship.</p>

<p>Unless … unless you look at it through the eyes of a stalker who feels he’s been wronged by a woman, some way, or somehow, and in his attempt at revenge, he’s set out on one of the nastiest, and most dangerous doxxing efforts I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>But … what would make you think this is an attempt a doxxing someone to a mass amount of people, out of some sick, twisted attempt at revenge?</p>

<p>Firstly, in some of the profiles created that send out these messages, there are … strangely enough, real-world addresses included. I’m not going to <em>post</em> those addresses here, but you have to ask yourself … why would someone include the address to where they work in a social media profile?</p>

<p>That’s strange.</p>

<p>And then there’s the fact that every single photo of her that exists on Mastodon, has some strange aura to it. As if … they’re all screenshots from video calls.</p>

<p>For example, look at this profile …</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/fediverse-chick/nicole2.png" /></p>

<p>Not only do these look like screen-grabs from some kind of video call app, but <em>who in the world</em> structures a profile like this? Your selfie in the banner, and your selfie in the avatar?</p>

<p>In my opinion, more evidence showing that this is likely more than some scripted clout-grab.</p>

<p>Then, if you get extra sleuthy, you can attempt to reverse image search one of these photos, and do you know what kind of results you get?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>At least, nothing outside of the Mastodon source that all of these images are posted to.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> way this would be possible, is if these photos were never actually shot, and taken, and then uploaded somewhere. This would only be possible, if some dude were screenshotting your face in video-to-video calls, and saving them to his hdd in order to use later.</p>

<p>Such as, in an attempt to get some kind of revenge against you, by making an entire social network think that you’re some annoying person who thinks script-spamming thousands to millions of random people will get you follows. And, for all intents and purposes, that whole idea would work just fine … if all of the photos didn’t look like screengrabs, and if real world addresses weren’t included in some of the profiles.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> one central profile this seems to be coming from, or, at least, an account that’s mentioned in <em>most</em> of the messages. And, maybe it’s just not been properly moderated, maybe nobody at friendica.world is paying attention to this account. But, <em>most</em> of the messages sent to people include mentioning the profile <a href="https://friendica.world/contact/1462572" target="_blank">@fediversechick@friendica.world</a>.</p>

<p>But, if you were hoping that this would answer any questions, <em>it doesn’t</em>. Although, I do now have an account on friendica.world!</p>

<p>This is about as far as my investigating has gotten. I know there are usually Discord and Matrix servers mentioned along with some, or all of these messages, but I’ve never joined them, because … <em>who</em> in the right mind would do that?</p>

<p>But, I’m not sure I believe that this is some random girl who can’t keep her scripts to herself.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="fediverse" /><category term="scams" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve been on the fediverse for a while now, it’s very likely you’ve been “nicoled,” in that an account on a random instance, calling herself “Nicole the Fediverse Chick” has sent you a private message, talking about who she is, and where you can follow her.

<p>In the below article …</p>

<div class="link-preview" data-url="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/bluesky-is-weighing-a-proposal-that-gives-users-consent-over-how-their-data-is-used-for-ai/"></div>

<p>It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
The demand for AI training data means the new social network has to think about its AI policy, even though it doesn’t plan to train its own AI systems on users’ posts.
<br /><br />
However, the public nature of Bluesky’s social network has already allowed others to train their AI systems on users’ content, as was discovered last year when 404 Media came across a dataset built from 1 million Bluesky posts hosted on Hugging Face.
<br /><br />
Bluesky competitor X, meanwhile, is feeding users’ posts into sister company xAI to help train its AI chatbot Grok. Last fall, it changed its privacy policy to allow third parties to train their AI on users’ X posts, as well. The move, followed by the U.S. elections that elevated X owner Elon Musk’s status within the Trump administration, helped fuel another exodus of users from X to Bluesky.
<br /><br />
As a result, Bluesky’s open source, decentralized X alternative has grown to over 32 million users in just two years’ time.
<br /><br />
Speaking at SXSW, Graber explained that the company has engaged with partners to develop a framework for user consent over how they would want their data to be used — or not used — for generative AI.
<br /><br />
“We really believe in user choice,” Graber said, saying that users would be able to specify how they want their Bluesky content to be used.
<br /><br />
“It could be something similar to how websites specify whether they want to be scraped by search engines or not,” she continued.
<br /><br />
“Search engines can still scrape websites, whether or not you have this, because websites are open on the public internet. But in general, this robots.txt file gets respected by a lot of search engines,” she said. “So you need something to be widely adopted and to have users and companies and regulators to go with this framework. But I think it’s something that could work here.”
</blockquote>

<p>And while I don’t agree that Bluesky is <em>actually</em> decentralized, and I feel like, at the current moment, they’re really just using this as a buzzword, and I also don’t think it’s a great idea to put any faith in AI companies <em>actually</em> respecting a robots.txt, the part you should pay attention to, is …</p>

<blockquote>
However, the public nature of Bluesky’s social network has already allowed others to train their AI systems on users’ content, as was discovered last year when 404 Media came across a dataset built from 1 million Bluesky posts hosted on Hugging Face.
</blockquote>

<p>That a company <em>has already</em> scraped Bluesky, and that’s what this is about.</p>

<p>Bluesky wants to offer its users the ability to say whether or not they want this to happen. It doesn’t mean these companies will <em>respect</em> that, but <em>not even Mastodon</em> has a toggle in preferences that embeds a robots.txt file into <em>your profile</em>.</p>

<p><em>In fact,</em> there are <em>quite a few instances</em> across the Fediverse, whose rules completely ignore the existence of AI, don’t mention it at all, and even some actively protect users who <em>post</em>, or even <strong>sell</strong>, generated slop.</p>

<p>So, unfortunately, I think I do have to say here, that Bluesky might actually be ahead on this, in that they’ve somehow managed to think of this, <em>before</em> any working on Mastodon has.</p>

<p>But, back to my main point here, you <em>also</em> have to pay attention to that first line. Aha! You thought I forgot about that, didn’t you?</p>

<blockquote>
The demand for AI training data means the new social network has to think about its AI policy, even though it doesn’t plan to train its own AI systems on users’ posts.</blockquote>

<p>This is kind of interesting wording. One <em>might</em> assume that the people behind Bluesky <em>have</em> an AI system that they’re running. Or, you could take it to mean, <em>if</em> they develop a system, they don’t plan to use it to scrape your posts.</p>

<p>I guess you could take it either way, honestly.</p>

<p>All of that said, and this article sliced into bite-sized pieces, absolutely don’t get me wrong, people <em>definitely</em> have reason to be skeptical, and ask questions, as I do, <em>all of the time</em>. Social media has come crashing down all around us over the past five years. Many people have <em>lost</em> the basis of their livelihoods because of it. Some just picked a new place, and set up shop.</p>

<p>Heck, I <em>used to have</em> 3000+ followers on Twitter, and some of that (aside from Mastodon), was <em>the basis</em> for my ability to <em>actually sell music.</em> And I gave that up. I don’t mean that as a, “I sacrificed more than you,” but more as a like, “I understand your skepticism and fears.”</p>

<p>But I feel it’s <em>important</em> to get the facts straight, and even if you vehemently <em>hate</em> everything that Bluesky stands for, you should make sure that everything you say <em>accurately</em> represents and depicts who they are, and what they’re doing. It’s all about credibility. At least, if you want people to believe you.</p>

<p>For further clarification on all that’s going on here, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0008-user-intents" target="_blank">read the actual proposal on Github</a> in order to dive deeper into what Bluesky is putting forth.</p>

<p>And I definitely want to reiterate, Mastodon has <em>a lot</em> of work to do in making itself <em>less</em> friendly to scrapers and AI scammers.</p>]]></content><author><name>⸸ commander ░ nova ⸸ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="scrapers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m writing this, partially because, I need something to write about to take my mind off the pain of potentially having broken my toe at work, and because I’ve seen and kind of keep seeing people sharing this as a way to say, “Hey, Bluesky is about to start scraping its users data for profit in relation to AI companies.” And, I really do think it needs to be highlighted, that that’s not what any of this says.]]></summary></entry></feed>
