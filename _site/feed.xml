<p>The positive to this, is, I don’t have to worry about storage constraints with posting procedurally generated images to Bluesky, infinitely, <em>forever</em>. And the way I’ve made the Python and JavaScript pairing, is that, once this is generated, and posted, it gets deleted from the server. Foolproof. Fullproof? Which is the right word? The world may never know.</p>

<p>But, I worry about the future a lot, and I like to preserve the things I do so that, <em>no matter what happens</em>, there’s always a contingency. So, now my social media Python stuff <em>also</em> has a contingency. And there’s this, alongside maybe 8 or 9 other scripts that run on a continuous basis, or on intervals depicted by cronjobs, on <strong><em>just a six dollar per month VPS over at Digital Ocean</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it gets slow at times. I’ve logged into my server to suddenly experience severe lag. So much so, that now I have daily restart times in order to start fresh, and then throughout the day, lag builds, and builds, and builds, and then it restarts again (lol).</p>

<p>I’m <em>sure</em> there’s something I could do to make whichever script is causing this more efficient, but it all still works, regardless!</p>

<p>Just exactly what I’ll do next, I’m not sure. But I <em>do</em> think if I keep going I’ll have to upsize the droplet. Or, maybe this is <strong>enough</strong> for now. We’ll see.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Python" /><category term="python" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my efforts to continually preserve the weird things that I do, and have been doing, and/or am also learning to do, I setup a Python noise generation script, that’s completely procedural (like the other ones), and plopped it onto a Bluesky account.

<script async="" src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I bring this person’s Bluesky post here, not because they’re some kind of arbiter of Bluesky vs. Mastodon as a topic, but <em>just because</em> this is a sentiment I see <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, a lot of people just want to input a username, a password, and then sign-in and start posting. At risk of sounding inflammatory, or cynical, <em>people don’t want to think.</em></p>

<p>But it seems to go beyond that. Choosing a server, joining a community, expressing your interests, and sharing who you <em>really are</em>, should be something <em>fun</em>, right? But throughout the attached thread, this is apparently seen as as <em>barrier</em>. It’s seen as … gatekeeping?</p>

<p>And then the issue with “filters” for posts, or, what they’re called on Mastodon, <em>content warnings</em>. I’ve seen <em>so many people</em> express discontent with having to use them, when to use them, <em>why</em> they’re expected to. A lot of people just want to post, “Here’s my dissertation on the current political climate, and why you should panic,” and expect that no one would be like, “Hey, could you maybe not do this without some kind of warning?” Because, and I have to start again with things that sound like uncharitable takes, <em>they don’t want to consider other people when they say and do things?</em></p>

<p>That <em>sure</em> is a sentiment of your average “influencer,” or people who wish they were.</p>

<p>What is an influencer? Someone who posts with an inflated sense of self, who assumes that people are fans, followers are their adoring masses, that you should come to them, and accept what they have to say, and what they do, because <em>they’re special</em>, and you are a peasant.</p>

<p>What I really think about all of this, is that this is a sickness that was generated by Twitter. It was curated, crafted, and instilled into the masses over years, and years of use of the platform. The algorithm was made to incentivize selfishness, and venom, and so, therefore, that’s how people began to act, that’s how they started to use social media.</p>

<p>Twitter was <em>bad</em> well before it was ever bought out by a megalomaniac.</p>

<p>And now we have … a clone of it?</p>

<p>Okay, so Bluesky is good. There are <em>a lot</em> of cool features, and hey! You <em>can</em> sorta, by proxy, connect it to Mastodon!</p>

<p>But <em>because</em> it’s billed as like this … exact Twitter clone, <em>that’s how people are treating it.</em> They’re bringing that behavior, they’re bringing that inflated ego syndrome, they’re bringing the venom, and they’re <em>continuing it</em>.</p>

<p>And when they’re faced with the idea of joining communities, and being social, and being thoughtful of others, it’s … it’s seen as a bad thing.</p>

<p>In the beginning, in parenthesis, I mentioned how I wouldn’t want to lose my instance, and if I did, it would be too heartbreaking for me to move, and find a new place to be on the fediverse. And it’s true. I’ve been on Mastodon since 2017, and I’ve been in <em>many</em> places. My instance is <em>my home</em>, and I think if I lost it, I would probably concede myself to my Bluesky account.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that <em>you</em> shouldn’t at least give Mastodon a chance. That’s not to say that you <em>shouldn’t</em> look to learn, and find ways to be social online, again. But, for me, the way I exist on the fediverse, is with my own blood, sweat, and tears.</p>

<p>But I do think decentralized islands are probably the future?</p>

<p>And maybe I’m wrong, maybe I <em>would</em> stick around on the fediverse, even <em>if</em> I lost mkultra.monster. Who knows, I don’t know. The future is a variable I don’t know.</p>

<p>What I do know is …</p>

<p>I’m not sure Bluesky will make it. I’m not sure Bluesky will make it, because they’re backed by big money, by people <em>you absolutely should not trust</em>, who will <em>eventually</em> need to raise their own money, and that’s exactly how Twitter became an X. Take my words with a grain of salt. But there’s a reason that the newest generation of teenagers becoming adults are <em>bad</em> at making social connections. That, all people, are connecting <em>less</em>. And it’s not just because society has become more frantic, more driven by greed.</p>

<p>There are <em>billions</em> of people online, and hundreds of millions of people across Threads, X, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and there are <em>many more</em> social media apps that I haven’t even mentioned here. But the one constant that I’ve noticed on most of them, is that genuine connection is <em>hard to come by</em>. Even on Mastodon, for as socially connected and more thoughtful that it is. I, myself, struggle to connect with people. I don’t know what to say, I don’t know what to do.</p>

<p>Sometimes I hit people with a “like” and then I keep on posting. But sometimes I reach out, and I try to be conscious of what I say, and what I do, and that’s <em>largely</em> because of the time I’ve spent on the fediverse.</p>

<p>Is that <em>really</em> a bad thing? Is that gatekeeping? Is that … <em>user-hostile</em>?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="mastodon" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I’ve explored this topic before, but it keeps coming up on my timeline.

Have you ever visited a webpage and thought to yourself, “Man, I wish there was like, a huge mountain of data and pictures for me to stare it!” Well, my friend, I am here to give you exactly that. With JavaScript and Python, I give you, Pixelfed, and my latest product from Second Life!</p>

<p>Tooling around with Pixelfed’s API was a little frustrating, and I <em>still</em> haven’t figured out what I was doing wrong in order to pull statuses <em>directly</em> from the source (with an access code). So, in order to do this, regardless, I decided to utilize my Pixelfed profile atom feed to do <em>exactly</em> what I was trying to accomplish. RSS is the past, and also the future! … apparently.</p>

<p>If you scroll down and look to the left, you’ll see the five most recent photos from my Pixelfed account, which will update automatically as I add new things to it.</p>

<p>After that, I took my simmering migraine headache, and made some scripts to take a look at my Second Life store’s marketplace page. Pointed some python at it and said “Assemble the link, then open the link, then extract the photo and the title.”</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<p>Down on the right of the page, you can see my latest product from my Second Life store, and if you click it, you’ll go right to the page!</p>

<p>At this point, I have <em>kind of</em> a large amount of content connected to API and my proxy servers, all pulling information from the different platforms I interact with, <em>as I update them</em>. And that’s what automation is all about.</p>

<p>Removing obstacles to things I want to do, and things I want to show the world.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m not sure I feel like putting these code snippets and scripts onto Github today. My head <em>hurts</em>, like <em>ass</em>.</p>

<p>So, that’s the post.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="scripting" /><category term="programming" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="github" /><category term="tags" /><category term="second-life" /><category term="blogging" /><category term="pixelfed" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more themes around developing automation for my daily internet-life, I decided to make even more little features for my website.

And I thought, “You know, I <em>hate</em> how I have to manually create new pages for every tag I put on a post. What is this? 1927?” So, I set out to fix that problem, and fix that problem I did. But it didn’t come without a small hiccup.</p>

<p>Because, apparently, Github Pages can only use a <em>certain</em> Jekyll version (which is ridiculous), so, if you were attempting to do this with a custom ruby gem, you <em>wouldn’t be able to run it</em>, unless you stop using the github_pages defined “safe” plugins. Oh no! And switching to full Jekyll, while cool and good, will <em>break</em> GH Pages, and maybe other things! So, instead of building this into the workflow, and having separate this, and separate that, I said, “Hell no, what? We got Python for that.”</p>

<p>And Python we did done do.</p>

<p>I’m the kind of person who likes to write. I <em>also</em> like to do all of my writing in VS Code, because it makes me feel cool. And, part of writing, is <em>removing</em> obstacles that make it tedious, and repetitive. Such as copy/pasting links to my new posts, and spreading them across social networks (a problem solved by my server and a ton of scripts), or tagging your posts like you would on Wordpress, and then having to create each tag page manually, so that they can be clicked on.</p>

<p>Like I said on the <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/Jekyll-Tag-Generator" target="_blank">Github repository</a> for these scripts I’ve created … What am I? A caveman?</p>

<p>It seems like, the <em>more</em> I do the same things over and over, the <em>more</em> I need automation to take care of the boring stuff I don’t want to do.</p>

<p>You know.</p>

<p>Those things that AI was supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>I’ve been copying and pasting links to blog posts and sharing them on social media, for decades. <em>Decades</em>. So, when I figured out how to make all of that happen <em>automatically</em>, it was like a dehydrated man in the Sahara Desert discovering a pond. And, after that, it was just <em>more</em> identifying little annoying tasks that take away from doing <em>what I want to do</em>, and then <em>eliminating</em> them. Like the Terminator and a billion Sarah Connors.</p>

<p>But I still haven’t figured out how I want to automatically fetch post IDs for shared post links on Mastodon, and then copy them into said new posts, so that Mastodon comment sections are generated automatically.</p>

<p>We’ll get there, though!</p>

<p>Uh …</p>

<p>Soon!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="scripting" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="github" /><category term="tags" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying to think of something new to do with my website while I sip a very large beverage this evening, heading into another day off.

I’ve dated a lot of people. Thirty-some-odd people. But I also, kind of, in my brain sauce, circle back to the one woman with whom I thought would last. None of them last. But her and I were <em>different</em>. We were different, and then we were over.</p>

<p>Inevitably, she broke up with me for some dude at Starbucks, and I was angry, and then I was sad, and then I forgot about her for a while when I initially started my transition. Sometimes I wonder if that breakup is what triggered it. I’m not transitioning now, and I don’t know if I’ll ever return to it, but that’s a whole story. I enjoy navigating my life being confused about gender, and just being forward-facing however I feel like being. But I heard from her once or twice over the years. Over the course of the last fourteen years. And I don’t know <em>why</em> I still think about her.</p>

<p>There are so many other ex girlfriends I could think about. I could think about the one I was with long-distance for a year, who disappeared overnight while I was sleeping, only to come back in Discord messages three years later to apologize.</p>

<p>I could think about the one whose rent I paid and drove to New York, who inevitably broke it off with me to get back with her estranged husband.</p>

<p>I could think about the two women I dated in separate states, who used me for their own gain in different ways, and then tossed me aside like a broken toy.</p>

<p>Hell, I could even think about my highschool girlfriend, who somehow remains a part of my life, in some tiny, almost insignificant way.</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>My head always circles back to <em>the one</em>.</p>

<p>And I don’t even know what it is about her anymore. I don’t think it’s important. I don’t think I even exist to her in 2024, and rightfully so. <em>Why would I?</em></p>

<p>But it makes me feel like, or wonder, if one of the reasons I have such a hard time, in my near forties, getting <em>close</em> to anyone, is because I <em>refuse</em> to let go of the past. Most of the time all of my thoughts are living in the nineties, or the early 2000s, and I think of myself as I was then, rather than how I am and who I am, <em>now</em>. Everything is me trying to escape what I currently <em>am</em>, and it’s a wonder that even <em>with</em> more matches than I can shake a stick at on dating apps, <em>I talk to no one</em>.</p>

<p>The present is crumbling all around us, and simultaneously, I’ve never been in a better position in my <em>entire life</em>.</p>

<p>And I’m still working on myself, on all of these things, and I’m getting <em>better and better</em> by the day, <em>at everything</em>.</p>

<p>So then why can’t I let go of the past? Why can’t I ever shake this person, the starbucks-betrayer, out of my head, <em>once and for all</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t know. Maybe this public journal post will derive some kind of enlightenment … ten years into the future when I’m hopefully married and not sitting alone in front of a computer like I always am.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, while I was working away, (not on the code I shared in my other post, but at work), I suddenly fell into this kind of melancholy.

I wasn’t happy with cbox as a “guestbook” of sorts. It was intrusive, and it was nothing more than an injection of code from some other source, controlled by some other person. That’s no good. I want to be in control of <em>everything</em> having to do with, and running on my website. Therefore, I made GuestPoast.</p>

<p>GuestPoast, available to check out <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/GuestPoast" target="_blank">over on Github</a>, is a relatively simple guestbook system that you can setup and use on a static website. In this case, we’re using Jekyll, because that’s what I know best at this point. But! Because we’re using Python, I’m running those scripts on a VPS with a reverse proxy, and runners that keep the guestbook comments live, <em>at all times</em>. There is a way to use Github to run Python, among other things, but I’m a little turned off by the limitation of working seconds (I honestly don’t know how much I’d use if I used Github as a personal VPS. I have a lot of things running over at Digital Ocean).</p>

<p>But, once you’ve got it all setup, you can then <em>also</em> dive into the JavaScript side of the project, and add naughty words, or <em>slurs</em>, that you don’t want nefarious users to post. Or, you can troll your visitors by not allowing them to say certain things like, “Hello.” Not sure why you’d want to do that, though.</p>

<p>This is one, in a long line of things I’ve been wanting to do with my website. Ultimately, I’d like my site to be <em>fully</em> integrated with ActivityPub, but whether that’s actually possible or not remains up-in-the-air. And then, of course, we have Bluesky threatening to overtake all social networks. And, I mean, I <em>like</em> Bluesky. But it’s less <em>technical</em> feeling. It’s less <em>mine</em>. My Mastodon instance is my own, the things I do, post, and develop that interact with it <em>are my own</em>. Mastodon, to me, feels like an extension of my Linux operating system. And maybe that’s why the normals don’t like it so much. I don’t know, I’m rambling in my thoughts.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this new development I’ve put up for free public consumption!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Web Dev" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, yesterday, I got home from work late, and wanted to do something more with my website.

We talked about the ways in which artists, writers, or creators in-general are taken from, at all angles, with the promise of a boost, or fame, or an income. And I’m still thinking about it.</p>

<p>It really feels like the AI that scrapes the web for everything ever made by a human being, in order to create amalgamations that look like nightmarish gloss-puke is the endgame to all of this. But I’ve jumped into the epilogue before we explore the content of the text.</p>

<p>For decades, creative work has always been demanded by those who <em>don’t</em> create, to be free. It got to the point that these things were so devalued by the general public, that it spawned music streaming services that pay fractions on the fraction of another fraction of a penny. It spawned entitled attitudes that get slung at artists doing commissions, that they should not <em>dare</em> charge a fair hourly rate for their work, that they should be grateful for <em>exposure</em>. It spawned endless compendiums of amateur, indie-fiction, because getting into a publishing house is more like a whole <em>scam</em> nowadays.</p>

<p>And, eventually, it spawned the full and total pillaging of all of this work, funneled straight to those who believe an idea is worth more than work.</p>

<p>But I wanted to talk more about another side to all of this.</p>

<p>As a person who creates, how do you get the word out to people? Do you post on social media and pray that people don’t demonize you for “advertising?” Do you pay for a blue checkmark on Threads in the hopes that it translates into the work that you do <em>actually being seen</em> and <em>appreciated</em> by people?</p>

<p>Have you seen the playlisters in online music scenes who charge artists money to have their music placed on thousand-listener lists? Have you been a store creator in Second Life whose only avenue to advertising their work, is by paying hundreds of dollars to land owners who host store events (this example is a little niche, but directly related to things I personally do)? Have you paid social media coaches to tell you how to post online to draw in the most engagement possible? Queue the random trash-question-posting and rage-bait.</p>

<p>Or, maybe, as an author, or <em>indie</em> author, you’ve spent years querying, only to have your work potentially stolen by a narcissistic agent who posts on Twitter about how she thinks someone <em>else</em> should have your idea, and do it better.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/creators/agents.webp" /></p>

<p>In our society, it <em>really</em> seems like the artist, the writer, the maker, the doer, is constantly in a web of traps, laid out by the grifters. Everyone wants to make money off of you, off of your ideas, off of your <em>work</em>, while you squabble in debt, and minimum wage. And the most infuriating part is, <em>they do</em>.</p>

<p>“Pay me, and I’ll make sure you see that success you’ve been grasping for.”</p>

<p>Pay, pay, pay!</p>

<p>One of the reasons my next novel has been basically frozen in time, is because sometimes I <em>really</em> feel like it’s pointless to put something out there. Especially now, that … as soon as you do, it’ll be gobbled up by the plagiarism machines.</p>

<p>I’ve seen <em>so much</em> of this in all that I do, because I’ve been doing these things <em>my whole life</em>. And the scammers, the grifters … they <em>all</em> have the louder voice, the largest influence, and it makes <em>no sense</em> to me.</p>

<p>It makes no sense that these types of people and this type of behavior really receives no pushback, whatsoever.</p>

<p>But then I remember the decades past, the squawking about how all of the things you spend hours, days, weeks, <em>months</em> on, <strong>should</strong> be free, and if you <strong>have</strong> to sell it, it should be <em>dirt cheap</em>.</p>

<p>It <em>creates</em> the condition where you start to feel as though <em>you have no choice</em> but to cough up cash to those who believe any money made from the things that you do, <em>belongs to them</em>.</p>

<p>And then the cycle repeats, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Do you wanna know how much I make from streaming without any advertising on the part of paid services, monthly?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/creators/music.png" /></p>

<p>But we don’t currently live in a society that enables any kind of environment where this can be fixed. We live in the society that will make this worse. And you’re only option in the creation of dreams, art, prose, and more, <em>is to do it for the love of it</em>, and nothing else. Because if you don’t have even <em>that</em>, then what’s the point of anything?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was having a conversation with a singer in Second Life yesterday, and it quickly went down the road of parasocial relationships, expectations, and suddenly, money-traps.

Yes, I posted an <em>unfinished</em> version of it. But now, if the universe looks kindly upon me, <em>it is done</em>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <strong><em>POAST</em></strong>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/poast" target="_blank">Now on Github</a>, I’ve uploaded the scripts needed in order to make this work for <em>your own</em> Jekyll blog. You should note that this is <em>specifically</em> for Jekyll, and you <em>will</em> need a VPS of some kind to host poast.py. Unless you’re magic, and you can run Python on a static site.</p>

<p>If you don’t know where to start with all that, I suggest taking a look at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>, where you can rent a bare bones VPS for the lowest spec at like 6 dollars a month. And that’s really <em>all you need</em> for poast.py to run (you don’t even need its lowest spec, you could probably execute this script on a 486).</p>

<p>Now, one of the things I mention in the readme on Github, is that I’m using the root user to make this happen. I want to reiterate here, you <em>probably</em> shouldn’t do this, and would be better off making a new user in order to put all of this together. But, I like to live dangerously, and also I don’t feel like reconfiguring everything and moving stuff around.</p>

<p>So it’s whatever.</p>

<p>I consider this project one of my bigger achievements, because it took me a <em>long time</em> to get to this point. Had I more testosterone and <em>more</em> anger, building these scripts could have driven me to put a fist through a wall at times.</p>

<p>But this is one of the things I’ve been wanting to do, ever since I ditched Wordpress and moved to Jekyll. Because, the way I see it, if you can think of it, <em>you can build it</em> (with Python? maybe … Rust?).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this is useful for someone other than me, and, as a side note, if you scroll down on this website and click the DOOM Guy face, you can play a little DOOM.</p>

<p>Edit: I’ve been informed that you <em>are</em> actually able to execute Python in a Github workflow bash. Queue me, tearing out all my hair. Nevertheless, this repo will remain unchanged until/if I decide to utilize this approach (which would be limited by Github’s monthly seconds, anyway).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Scripting" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you may be asking yourself, “Hey, didn’t you already post the code to this directly on your blog?” And the answer to that question would be, yes.
