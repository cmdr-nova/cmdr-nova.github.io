Yes, I posted an <em>unfinished</em> version of it. But now, if the universe looks kindly upon me, <em>it is done</em>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <strong><em>POAST</em></strong>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/poast" target="_blank">Now on Github</a>, I‚Äôve uploaded the scripts needed in order to make this work for <em>your own</em> Jekyll blog. You should note that this is <em>specifically</em> for Jekyll, and you <em>will</em> need a VPS of some kind to host poast.py. Unless you‚Äôre magic, and you can run Python on a static site.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt know where to start with all that, I suggest taking a look at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>, where you can rent a bare bones VPS for the lowest spec at like 6 dollars a month. And that‚Äôs really <em>all you need</em> for poast.py to run (you don‚Äôt even need its lowest spec, you could probably execute this script on a 486).</p>

<p>Now, one of the things I mention in the readme on Github, is that I‚Äôm using the root user to make this happen. I want to reiterate here, you <em>probably</em> shouldn‚Äôt do this, and would be better off making a new user in order to put all of this together. But, I like to live dangerously, and also I don‚Äôt feel like reconfiguring everything and moving stuff around.</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs whatever.</p>

<p>I consider this project one of my bigger achievements, because it took me a <em>long time</em> to get to this point. Had I more testosterone and <em>more</em> anger, building these scripts could have driven me to put a fist through a wall at times.</p>

<p>But this is one of the things I‚Äôve been wanting to do, ever since I ditched Wordpress and moved to Jekyll. Because, the way I see it, if you can think of it, <em>you can build it</em> (with Python? maybe ‚Ä¶ Rust?).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this is useful for someone other than me, and, as a side note, if you scroll down on this website and click the DOOM Guy face, you can play a little DOOM.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Scripting" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you may be asking yourself, ‚ÄúHey, didn‚Äôt you already post the code to this directly on your blog?‚Äù And the answer to that question would be, yes.

<p>You‚Äôll notice, if you‚Äôre on desktop, the toggle switch is up at the top left. If you‚Äôre reading this on mobile, the toggle will be at the top of the main page (outside of posts, and pages you‚Äôve navigated to). Now, if you feel like you don‚Äôt want to be saturated in darkness, you can switch on <em>bone-meal mode</em>. Which, despite disliking most light mode settings on websites, is <em>actually</em> pretty easy on the eyes, due to it not being full-blown, eye-bleaching white.</p>

<p>This is more reminiscent of a forum I used to visit as a 15 year old in high school, by the name of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020324043350/http://animeboards.com/" target="_blank">animeboards.com</a>. A website that I have <em>fond</em> and also <em>bad</em> memories of (my first interaction with online trolls happened here). This also reminds me that I‚Äôd <em>love</em> to setup an old school style PHPBB forum ‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know how I would get people to join, <em>of if they‚Äôd even want to.</em></p>

<p>Anyway, you can grab the associated scripts to make this work for yourself, on your <em>own</em> website, <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/light_mode_toggle" target="_blank">here</a>, on my Github.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Web Dev" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‚Äôve had a little bit of time off of work now, and aside from the script I made that updates dynamically with your name and avatar image on Mastodon, I decided it was time for my website to have a light mode toggle.

The first thing I did was delete a bunch of fluff from the sidebars. The next thing I did was make some JavaScript that automatically updates my avatar and author name on posts (and other pages) with whatever I‚Äôm using on Mastodon, completely dynamically.</p>

<p>I put both JavaScript files into a repository on GitHub, along with an explanation on how to use them, <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/dynamic_mastodon_info" target="_blank">here</a>. No CORS headers or proxy servers required (this is a frequent problem with things I do here)!</p>

<p>Basically, what both scripts do, is simply read the meta tags from your profile, <em>on Mastodon</em>. All you have to do is make sure that you run these scripts in the head of your HTML, input your user profile <em>into</em> the top of the scripts, and then include each script‚Äôs class in an &lt; img &gt; tag and an &lt; a &gt; tag.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs it!</p>

<p>Now you can screw around and change your avatar and username on Mastodon, and <em>any time you do that</em>, it‚Äôll be updated on your website.</p>

<p>If giving the illusion that your website is federated with ActivityPub is something you enjoy doing, this is just <em>one more way</em> to do that.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Scripting" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This morning, I woke up from three and a half hours of sleep after a long overnight shift, and decided I wanted to change some things on this site.

Obviously, there are reasons to be on Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and for some, it‚Äôs a race to the finish line, as to which one ‚Äúwins‚Äù the main-character-social-media-site award.</p>

<p>But I don‚Äôt believe either of the three options will ever be the ‚Äúmain-line, main-character‚Äù choice. I think people will continue from this point forward, having specific things they want to accomplish and do online, and the place they go will depend on those very things.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you join Threads, you‚Äôre probably a fan of Instagram, and you‚Äôre looking to connect with, maybe, your audience, or something. And then there‚Äôs the ex-Twitter users spilling over, because, it <em>is</em> for sure something <em>like</em> Twitter.</p>

<p>Then you have Bluesky, the site that‚Äôs billing itself to be a Twitter replacement, gaining users rapidly, and there are definitely reasons you <em>shouldn‚Äôt</em> build a site in order to be the <em>next Twitter</em>. But, there are caveats of Bluesky, in that, you can post your balls and ass, and you won‚Äôt get censored. And lots, and <em>lots</em> of people love to do that, on Bluesky, <em>specifically</em>.</p>

<p>And then there‚Äôs the community building, the list-making, and the large portion of LGBTQ+ users flocking to the site.</p>

<p>It <em>could</em> contend to be a place that doesn‚Äôt suck.</p>

<p>And then you have Mastodon, basically, where <em>everyone</em> else goes. Linux enjoyers, and developers alike, <em>especially</em>. And one of the <em>only</em> social media places on the internet that isn‚Äôt run by either a billionaire, or backed by some kind of venture capital.</p>

<p>But what does it mean to use the other two?</p>

<p>Obviously, Zuck is a billionaire, a billionaire who definitely has bad ideas, and bad opinions. On the flipside, like mentioned in one of my recent articles, Bluesky is backed by Bitcoin Capital, run by people who know Steven Bannon intimately. So, are you <em>really</em> ultimately in for <em>anything different</em> than what you were exposed to on Twitter?</p>

<p>Maybe, <em>maybe not</em>.</p>

<p>I do think, though, that it‚Äôs becoming kind of muddy to say, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt use this, you should use <em>that</em> instead‚Äù because, as I‚Äôve just mentioned, both Threads and Bluesky have issues with influence from ‚Ä¶ the darker side of politics, and the world.</p>

<p>Notice how I don‚Äôt mention Mastodon, or ActivityPub in that, because AP is exactly what you make it. But, if I‚Äôve learned anything, <em>very many</em> people want to sign up on something and then forget about it, <em>forever</em>. Which is not something you do on Mastodon. On Mastodon, you have to be an <em>active</em> participant, almost <em>at all times</em> in order for it to become something that you enjoy. And, let‚Äôs face it, if you look at regular, normal users on Threads (for example), there are droves, and droves of people wholly uninterested in social participation, and more interested in a viral post that‚Äôll make them an imaginary millionaire.</p>

<p>At this point, I don‚Äôt think it matters too much what you use between the three, and fighting about it is a worthless endeavor. Bluesky and Threads are both connected to ActivityPub in different ways, <em>anyway</em>. So ‚Ä¶ you could say that Mastodon has already won this metaphorical social media war.</p>

<p>But, again, I don‚Äôt think these things matter.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> think you should consider your environment, and what the people who facilitate it believe, and say, on a regular basis. You <em>should</em> think critically about your participation online, be it via Threads, Bluesky, or <em>even</em> Mastodon.</p>

<p>And you most definitely shouldn‚Äôt be on Twitter.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I have to go to work on a rare overnight shift, I wanted to write about the current social landscape, and less about some kind of perceived competition between Threads and Bluesky, and more about what it means to use these platforms.

In the 90s we had webrings with select websites we wanted to connect with, and share with others. In blogging we have ‚Äúblogrolls,‚Äù and on social media we‚Äôve had ‚Äúfollow fridays‚Äù for ‚Ä¶ forever. And, in regards to the fediverse, numerous people have put together lists of users they think others should follow. So, by all means, Bluesky‚Äôs version of this is really <em>nothing new</em>, except in that they call follow lists ‚Äústarter packs.‚Äù In that spirit, I‚Äôve made my own, for the fediverse.</p>

<p>You can <a class="page-link" href="/pages/fedi-starter">check out my starter pack</a>, and follow via the little follow button I‚Äôve positioned next to each user‚Äôs name (yes, I‚Äôve included myself). And this is by no means an exhaustive and complete list! Currently, I‚Äôve slapped this together in about thirty minutes, after having come home from work, napped, and ate a pizza. The list contains those I enjoy seeing on my timeline, and I <em>fully</em> intend to keep adding to it!</p>

<p>Recently, I wrote about how I felt Bluesky was growing on me a little. Mostly in that, I don‚Äôt feel like you need to fully <em>avoid</em> it, and it does have its worth. In comparison to the fediverse though, I think I do still <em>mostly</em> prefer my instance, that I run <em>myself</em>, that I moderate <em>myself</em>, on an open protocol that is entirely run by regular normal people (save from the companies connecting or planning to connect to ActivityPub). And I <em>do</em> still have concerns about Bluesky, like how it recently received funding from a <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/bluesky-reaches-13-million-users-announces-funding/730989/#:~:text=On%20that%20front%2C%20Bluesky%20has,able%20to%20continue%20its%20development." target="_blank">crypto company</a>, and it could <em>totally</em> be bought by a billionaire with no morals at <em>any second.</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs for those reasons, I‚Äôd like to continue building on the fediverse, and this will eventually also include ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù in regards to my scripting and app development. I don‚Äôt want to <em>just</em> have scripts referencing Reddit forever. I‚Äôve mostly used Reddit as a testing ground for ideas.</p>

<p>But, anyway, I hope my starter pack helps you find new people to follow (even though it‚Äôs a bit tiny at the moment)!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea of a ‚Äúsocial media starter pack‚Äù is nothing new.

That was in my twenties, mostly, and also in the space of time that I was unemployed and suffering disability-levels of anxiety. But then something changed, and I became a machine.</p>

<p>Most days I come home from work, <em>now</em>, and I immediately load up VS Code and start typing. But before that it was music, and before that it was writing, and my Second Life store, or analyzing social media trying to figure out how to expand my audience. Why? Why do I now suddenly spend maybe five hours a week gaming, and the <em>rest</em> of my time just <em>making</em> things? I mean, I know why.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs partially my need, and <em>want</em>, to do something special, to do something people remember, or celebrate. But it‚Äôs also my need for self fulfillment. I used to go to work, come home, and just do whatever, and be content with that, and <em>always</em> that. But I‚Äôm not content in that anymore.</p>

<p>I went to tech school in the middle of high school to learn to code. I wanted to be a full time web developer. I wanted to be sitting at a computer, analyzing networks, building more efficient web apps, and just ‚Ä¶ basking in the code. And that was stolen from me. I don‚Äôt know if I stole it from myself, or if society pushed me into a place where I subconsciously deemed my lifelong dream career as secondary to what I needed to do in the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Except, we‚Äôre at <em>the now</em>, and even through accomplishment, and self improvement, there‚Äôs still just <em>more struggle</em>.</p>

<p>It hardly even bothers me anymore that I might just be single the rest of my life. It bothers me <em>more</em> that I‚Äôve been doing <em>all of these things</em>, and building websites, <em>especially</em>, since 19-frikken-99, and I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ opening boxes for a retailer? I‚Äôm wearing a vest and driving into a big box store, and I‚Äôm clocking eight hours, and just going home, and thinking ‚Ä¶ is this the rest of my life?</p>

<p>I think the switch came on when I realized that it <em>wasn‚Äôt</em>.</p>

<p>And now I‚Äôm terrified of stagnation.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the post. I don‚Äôt really know how to remedy this, short of continuing to submit my resume to places hoping something sticks.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don‚Äôt know when it happened, or even how it happened.

Today I want to sort of look back over the past year, and reflect on what it‚Äôs been like to <em>mostly</em> abandon Windows (with a slight hiccup of returning for a week).</p>

<p>A lot of people panicked earlier in the year when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182350/microsoft-windows-recall-launch-on-arm" target="_blank">Microsoft unveiled its AI powered ‚Äúrecall‚Äù feature</a>, that screenshots virtually every single thing you do, and then stores it for uh ‚Ä¶ recalling later. The scary part is, or was, that you definitely <em>should not</em> trust a mega corporation with that kind of info. <em>Even if they tell you not to worry.</em></p>

<p>And many rightfully made the plunge into Linux, and stayed there.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not why I abandoned Windows, though. I actually left Windows earlier than that, a couple months before the Recall announcement, when I decided that using a laptop for all the resource intensive things I do, ‚Ä¶ might not be a great idea sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Building a massive song in FL Studio with many, many layers can really lag out a system that isn‚Äôt up to spec.</em></p>

<p>See, I have another PC (that‚Äôs quite dusty now) that I bought in 2018, that was entirely crowdfunded, so that I could do things I need to do in order to make money (at least at the time), and it was great. It helped me out a lot and I eventually dug myself out of a hole. The thing is ‚Ä¶ Microsoft is dropping support for Windows 10, <em>next year</em>. And it pissed me off, <em>especially</em>, because the processor in that PC is <em>one generation</em> behind what Windows 11 supports. And, because of that, I would have been stuck on Windows 10, without any security updates, or substantial system updates, <em>forever</em>.</p>

<p>I ultimately decided that this was enough of an insult to literally <em>abandon Windows</em> altogether, and <em>forever</em> (seemingly).</p>

<p>You know, <em>and then</em> they announced Recall, like 2 months later. Two months after I bought a massively powerful Linux PC from <a href="https://system76.com" target="_blank">System 76</a>.</p>

<p>And for <em>months</em> I used it under their flagship operating system, Pop!_OS. I got familiar with VS Code for web development. I moved <em>all</em> of my creative work to Linux, and I even got <em>most</em> of my games that I regularly play working, just fine.</p>

<p>But, like it does with me sometimes, I got this itch. I wanted to play some Call of Duty, and I definitely don‚Äôt feel like running a console, when I have a PC with 64 gigs of ram, something like 15 cores, and 8 gigs of videoram. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.</p>

<p>So, I made a split decision, and installed Windows 11. And it was fine ‚Ä¶ for like a week.</p>

<p>But I noticed, even <em>with</em> all that power, Windows was ‚Ä¶ somehow laggy, and glitchy. Almost like my PC wasn‚Äôt <em>designed</em> for it (or maybe I forgot to download System76 drivers).</p>

<p>Either way, I said, ‚ÄúYou know what, this isn‚Äôt worth ONE game.‚Äù And I then installed one of my favorite Linux distributions, <em>Debian.</em></p>

<p>We‚Äôre almost caught up to where I am now.</p>

<p>For about two more weeks, I used Debian, and then I noticed some ‚Ä¶ weird things, such as games blowing my fans up and my PC sounding like it was taking off into space.</p>

<p>It was <em>then</em> I realized, I need to update my firmware, and have system drivers from System 76.</p>

<p>Which, unfortunately, has almost virtually <em>no</em> existing documentation for Debian.</p>

<p>Enter: Now.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm back on Pop!_OS.</p>

<p>What a journey.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pop_os/pop.png" /></p>

<p>The reason I originally <em>didn‚Äôt</em> immediately go back to Pop!_OS, was because I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ kind of unsure of how I‚Äôll react to my Gnome desktop being replaced by whatever it is they give me with COSMIC. But, fear of change aside, this OS is actually, or has actually, <em>really</em> grown on me.</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs probably as close to Arch as I‚Äôll ever get (that‚Äôs ragebait, Pop!_OS is nothing like Arch).</p>

<p>But, having spent <em>most</em> of the year in Linux, I think I can firmly call this OS my home. It feels natural. I <em>enjoy</em> opening the terminal. I <em>like</em> writing everything in code, even if I don‚Äôt have to.</p>

<p>I am become system developer.</p>

<p>Whatever they‚Äôre constantly saying on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/" target="_blank">/r/linuxsucks</a> is at least, <em>partially</em> untrue (and also, I can‚Äôt tell if these people are serious, or shitposting constantly). It‚Äôs not as complicated as they make it seem, but it is <em>definitely</em> more challenging than choosing a Mastodon instance.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pop_os/yes.png" /></p>

<p>You don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to be a developer to use Linux, but it helps!</p>

<p>You can literally just, make a Debian bootable, or a Mint bootable, and then replace Windows, and continue using your PC like nothing happened. You don‚Äôt even <em>have</em> to interact with the terminal. You can just use the graphical package manager that‚Äôs standard on, well, at least <em>three</em> Linux distributions I‚Äôve tried (but where‚Äôs the fun in that?)</p>

<p>You can install Pop!_OS, and then Steam, and then continue your game in Dwarf Fortress just by switching on a little toggle in Steam user options that enables Proton support across <em>every game you own</em>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs really that simple.</p>

<p>Just don‚Äôt expect to play anything with kernel-level anti-cheat.</p>

<p>Which is probably actually a <em>good</em> thing. Why do game developers think they‚Äôre allowed to touch the kernel? Who the hell do you think you are? That dude from Scary Movie 2?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pop_os/fingers.jpg" /></p>

<p>Suffice to say, I think Linux is where I‚Äôll stay. As Windows becomes more and more bloated, and far, <em>far</em> away from the nostalgia of its greatness in 1995, Linux easily takes its place.</p>

<p>Now, watch this wholesome Debian presentation I found on Youtube.</p>

Albeit, I had some <em>bad</em> experiences with some users who seem to have also been chased off of the platform for the way they treat others. But, I also have been skeptical about its mode of decentralization (where is it?), and them being VC backed, and recently funded by a crypto company. But, things are changing ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>They‚Äôre changing, because the social media landscape is changing. And I don‚Äôt mean, ‚ÄúMusk took over Twitter, so we probably have to go somewhere else‚Äù in a means of changing, but more like, ‚ÄúAll corporate social media with lax moderation methods run by billionaires is probably a good idea to flee from.‚Äù</p>

<p>And, for me, personally, looking at potentially <em>everything</em> becoming more expensive, and my bad experiences with being on Mastodon instances that aren‚Äôt <em>owned by me personally</em>, I‚Äôm looking at what I may need to do in the future.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I <em>love</em> the fediverse. But I have had to leave at least <em>five</em> different instances due to unjust banning, or extremely overzealous moderators who seek power in a digital space in order to a fill a void where they have none.</p>

<p>And for me, that‚Äôs a <em>problem.</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm a creator, I run a website, and now I also run a server with numerous scripts that showcase what I have, and <em>can</em> do. I run a digital ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù in Second Life, and I‚Äôm working simultaneously on an album and a novel. I‚Äôm a developer, a webmaster, a writer, and a sound designer, and I <em>can‚Äôt</em> put my future, and potential future <em>career</em> in the hands of people who could silence me at a moment‚Äôs notice, just because I, for example, said ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù to a troll.</p>

<p>Yeah, I‚Äôm <em>still</em> talking about the hackers.town incident.</p>

<p>Call me jaded, but I just don‚Äôt <em>know</em> if I can trust admins of a fediverse instance to not screw me over, since this is something that has happened to me, <em>over and over</em>.</p>

<p>Now, that‚Äôs not to say Bluesky doesn‚Äôt have methods of silencing people for no reason. They have public blocklists. But! What these blocklists <em>can‚Äôt</em> do, is erase your entire online presence in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs where I find myself at a theoretical future crossroads where, suddenly, maybe I can‚Äôt pay 40 some dollars a month upkeep on my personal Mastodon instance, and I have to look at the alternatives.</p>

<p>Albeit, Wafrn, and Kitsunes.club are decent enough fediverse servers, and their admins haven‚Äôt clobbered me out of existence (which would suck, because I‚Äôm <em>also</em> a partial admin/moderator on Wafrn), for one reason or another, they just feel like an <em>extension</em> of my online identity, rather than one that‚Äôs central. This isn‚Äôt a criticism of either of these places, but more probably just <em>me</em> being ‚Ä¶ weird. I don‚Äôt know. Owning my own Mastodon instance has given me a feeling of <em>real</em> control over how people interact with, and also perceive me online. And on something like Bluesky, I can sort of also achieve that, by forwarding my domain to my username, and redirecting my little bots to separate accounts (which I‚Äôve already done).</p>

<p>The thing is, I‚Äôm probably <em>way</em> overthinking all of this, but in this bout of turmoil I‚Äôm experiencing, Bluesky <em>has</em> grown on me a bit. I‚Äôve figured out how to use ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù to create my own ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù and I‚Äôve setup some placeholder moderation lists, and it feels ‚Ä¶ okay. It could feel alright, if, for some reason, I suddenly <em>have</em> to move there.</p>

<p>But ‚Ä¶ maybe I just haven‚Äôt given Wafrn or Kitsunes enough of a chance to be central to my online identity.</p>

<p>What I <em>do</em> know, is that it‚Äôs important to have control over your identity online, and to own your voice. To give the wrong people power over you in any regard, or facet, would be a <em>mistake</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‚Äôve had some criticisms of Bluesky, ever since it opened.

Despite all of that, today I decided to put together another pair of shorts for the set I‚Äôve been putting together for ‚Ä¶ a while. Today, it‚Äôs juicy green shorts!</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/juicy/juicy_ad.png" /></p>

<p>This is the second to last pair of shorts in the <em>Nano Nexus</em> set, and then I move on to ‚Ä¶ some other piece of clothing! And hopefully end up releasing it in a standard amount of time that is absolutely not equal to an <em>entire year</em>.</p>

<p>You can view them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-Juicy-Edition/26578153" target="_blank">digital marketplace</a>, or come and see them <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">in-world at the store</a> itself.</p>

<p>Speaking of <em>millions of other things</em> I work on, in unrelated news, I put together an RSS feed element for my website that reads my Bluesky feed, and then slapped it onto Github for others to check out and potentially use. You can see that <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/bsky-feed" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, it grabs the RSS feed of your profile (on Bluesky), bounces it off of a proxy so that it doesn‚Äôt spit out a ton of CORS errors, and then displays your most recent three posts. And, it updates with each page refresh!</p>

<p>Easy peasy.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also made it so new posts from this website <em>also</em> go to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cmdr-nova.bsky.social" target="_blank">my Bluesky account</a>, and since I haven‚Äôt really tested it yet, this post <em>should hopefully</em> get there safely. We‚Äôll see.</p>

<p>But, until my next release, or hacked code update, or random thought, have a good one!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It‚Äôs becoming kind of a trend, that I make something in my Second Life store, and then drop the whole thing for two to three months while I work on a million other things.
