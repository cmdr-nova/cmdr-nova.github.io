Then, I woke up, and ate an italian sub. This was just enough fuel for me to load up VS Code and get back to messing with my website. As you can probably see, if you’re reading this from the page itself, I’ve made some … <em>upgrades</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/playingwithjava/upgrades.gif" /></p>

<p>Obviously, I already detail some of what I do in my changelog, in regards to major changes, but I wanted to write up a post about it, because this site is making huge leaps in progress (ever since I redesigned the CSS in order to make this place much more responsive to various screens that people use). And, for being a completely static site built on the Jekyll foundation, you can hardly even tell that’s what it is.</p>

<p>Firstly, if you look to the right, you’ll see the Mastodon feed. For the longest time, this was just disjointed text with separators. You could only tell that it was coming from my Mastodon posts, because I had some text that said “mkultra feed” up above it. Despite how much I appreciate the original author of the script, I’ve been wanting to alter it so that it’s <em>much more obvious</em> it’s coming from Mastodon, or a social media website, in-general.</p>

<p>So, I did.</p>

<p><strong><em>I would upload this to GitHub, but I don’t remember who the author was, and I don’t want to just upload a modified version of their script without asking first.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, you’ll see that my actual Mastodon account information is linked to each post, as it updates live! If you click on the post date, this will then take you to the actual post itself, on my instance.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have a calendar on the right side of the page further down below this Mastodon feed. I mostly added this for flavor, because I noticed some sites in the indie web and Neocities sphere had little calendars, and rather than steal one, I decided to make one myself. But, in order to make it <em>unique</em>, and fun, I wanted to add some additional flavor to that as well.</p>

<p>It had some issues at first, but I’ve managed to setup some JavaScript in order to pull random top 100 images from the subreddit “/r/animewallpaper” in order to show a random image in the background, upon load. This is, semi, sort of using the Reddit API. And no, I’m not paying them a single dime in order to make this happen.</p>

<p>Next, as most who keep up with my blog will know, I’ve written python scripts that do numerous things. Such as pulling the top 5 trending posts from specific subreddits, and sending me an email of what’s trending, each morning. Another script that generates random text and then posts to Mastodon, based on a database of my own Mastodon posts backed up from the start of 2024, to now. And then, of course, we have my reddit-bot script that pulls from a list of my favorite subreddits and posts a random trending image to both Mastodon, and Tumblr.</p>

<p>In order to integrate this into my webpage, so that my work has some kind of permanence outside of social networks where it may not be as easily seen, I’ve written some JavaScript that utilizes Tumblr API to create a live feed of the posts that reddit-bot makes specifically to my Tumblr account (because that’s mostly the only thing I use it for nowadays, and it didn’t make sense to me to put multiple Mastodon account feeds on my site). You can see, over on the left side of the page, that it displays the <em>exact</em> text that’s posted to Tumblr whenever the bot makes its call, with images in-tact.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is a change many may not <em>ever</em> notice. I’ve written a modal that is used specifically and <em>only</em> on my <a class="page-link" href="/pages/haxpunks/">haxPunks page</a>. If you haven’t ever visited it, basically, back in 2022 I was making NFTs, and it made me a little money … <em>it’s why I have some of the tech that I currently do</em>. Despite all that money being gone, it helped me <em>a lot</em> in a period of my life where I was recovering from semi-self isolation that I put myself through for years. And, even though I’ve mostly stepped away from NFTs due to the volatile and toxic nature of the subculture, I still make little pixel people here and there when I feel like it (completely disconnected from the world of NFTs, despite them existing on the OpenSea blockchain).</p>

<p>But, I wanted the page to be more dynamic and fun to look at.</p>

<p>This modal makes it so that when you click an image of one of the pixel-people I’ve drawn, it blows it up on the screen without ever leaving the page, and gives you not only a better look, but also a description that’s derived from the alt text (I’m still working on writing a description for all of them, so upon posting this, only Charlotte with have a description).</p>

<p>That’s <em>most</em> of what I’ve done today, but I can still feel the itch to do even more. What that “more” entails, is entirely up to what my brain decides, whenever it comes to me.</p>

<p>But hey, thanks for reading!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I got off of work, sat down on my couch, and promptly passed the heck out.

It’s been a little never that I’ve ever written down my initial impressions of a <em>BioWare</em> game. Thinking back, I think the last one that I played all the way through was Andromeda. Which <em>was a good game</em>, despite the meandering open world that took away from the experience. But, now we’re back, with the conclusion (maybe?) of the Inquisition timeline, and everything is purple, and very shiny. These are my thoughts …</p>

<p>Back in the day, way back, only a couple years after the iPhone was released, and after Mass Effect was released, I played <em>my first</em> BioWare game. That’s right, I didn’t play Mass Effect 1 until <em>after</em> I beat Dragon Age: Origins. In 2009. This was a dicey period in my life, when I was living in numerous places that I moved from every three years. But the one thing that didn’t change, was that I was <em>constantly</em> gaming.</p>

<p>But anyway, fast forward to now, 2024, and it’s been legitimately ten years since I’ve beaten Inquisition. Hardly remember a thing I did in that game aside from romancing Sera on my elven mage, which you can see in the “scrap” page under my links within the hide-away link panel on this site. When I say these are my <em>initial</em> impressions, I mean, I played the game for 6.9 hours, and felt I had <em>enough</em> to go on to write <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>Right from the jump, I’m in character creation and taking my time, and the game suddenly slows to a slog, and eventually locks up. This caused me to have to restart my PC. I load up the game again in order to continue, and I notice some random slowdown here and there, but I force my way through and make it into the initial start of the game. You know, that opening piece BioWare showcased months and months ago. Cut scenes started locking up, and the same freezing was happening, so I took the graphic settings down from high, to medium, and this seemed to help <em>greatly</em>.</p>

<p><em>Note: I’m on Debian using the Gnome desktop environment under Wayland, if that’s anything to go by. So, yes, I’m using Steam’s Proton layer in order to run this game.</em></p>

<p>Since, at the end of character creation, BioWare has you basically … recreate your Inquisitor, and asks you a couple of very basic questions about your choices in the previous game, I’m all set and assuming my Inquisitor is about to show up.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>6.9 hours in, and I have not seen my Inquisitor even once, <em>yet.</em> This seems strange to me, because my Inquisitor was one of the people setting off to find Solas. And then we start Veilguard with <em>just</em> Varric, and some brand new people? Varric is the one who has managed to track Solas down, and me, with my fresh face, and some other people (okay, Harding isn’t a brand new face, but …) and we’re running up on him.</p>

<p><em>Where is the Inquisitor?</em></p>

<p>Where’s Hawke? <em>Where the hell is my Grey Warden?</em> And what are the consequences of my having fed the prisoner in Dragon Age: Origins?</p>

<p><em>** SPOILERS AHEAD **</em></p>

<p>Morrigan returns, albeit briefly, <em>so far</em>, and it’s looking like, since she divulged all the information she could about your grey warden in the previous game, any thoughts on that subject this time around <em>may not</em> ever be revisited.</p>

<p>I could be proven wrong on this, but I don’t expect to be.</p>

<p><em>** END SPOILERS **</em></p>

<p>Expectations aside, alright, let’s just play the game.</p>

<p>I push through the initial mission, then the second one, then the third one, then the fourth one, and I’m getting a little afraid that this game is just mission-to-mission gaming, and there’s no longer even any sense of exploration <em>whatsoever</em>.</p>

<p>You have a home-base, and places to speak to your team, so there’s that. At least that is some semblance of what Dragon Age once was. But it’s not until hours and hours into the game that you’re suddenly met with the world map, the many places you have to visit, the option to take side quests, and the ability to simply teleport somewhere, and <em>explore</em>.</p>

<p>Alright, so that aspect of Dragon Age is not dead, and is in fact alive and well. Kind of the way it was in Origins, funnily enough.</p>

<p>There was <em>another</em> time the game crashed, right around the fifth hour mark, and it was strange, because my videocard abruptly said “Nope” and then I was sent to my login screen? As if my PC did a stealth restart right then and there?</p>

<p>BioWare, you’ve got some patching to do, or something.</p>

<p>I’m enjoying it so far, though, at least. It’s a bit <em>lighter</em> on the atmosphere, the writing is … okay. It could use some updating. Like, the story is there, and there are gradual dripfeeds of previous content being given to you, but a lot of the writing leaves a little bit to be desired. But it’s at least fun.</p>

<p>Does it <em>feel</em> like Dragon Age?</p>

<p>That’s hard to say. It’s been <em>so long</em> since I’ve been immersed in the world, I hardly remember what it was like.</p>

<p>I remember the first time I played Origins. The concept of romancing characters in a game, <em>completely alien to me</em>.</p>

<p>Meeting Morrigan, finding the approval ratings. Trying to figure out how to make her like me the best, and then suddenly she was having my child.</p>

<p>And then there was Hawke, me wandering around this strange place, trying to figure out why I wasn’t allowed to continue my story of starting a family with Morrgian, and then <em>slowly</em> but surely getting used to the idea that BioWare didn’t want me to have that.</p>

<p>Years passed, and Inquisition came, and mentally, I was a completely different person. Morrigan was there with a few things to say about her apparent grey warden husband, father of her child, disappearing … <em>somewhere</em>.</p>

<p>Yeah, I have a long history with this franchise.</p>

<p>There was also a point that I <em>actually</em> expected to play the Inquisitor in Veilguard. I know all of the reasons, and have heard all of the points as to why it is the way it is right now, but to me, it still would have made sense to just <em>continue that story</em>.</p>

<p>Alas, BioWare says, “Nah.”</p>

<p>If we’re talking feeling disoriented, sprinting through the first six hours of the game trying to find some semblance of the past that I can connect my character to, and seeing some familiar faces and going “Oh shoot!” and just splattering every enemy in front of me with massive power, then … yes, absolutely. It <em>feels like Dragon Age</em>.</p>

<p>But <strong>where is my son</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a little while since I’ve written down my impressions of a game.

As most know, I shut down my city/the homestead a few months back. It’s really hard to justify spending 110+ USD a month on something that’s not making me any returns, and people really only visited on and off in short bursts. No fault of their own, I just mostly <em>always</em> lack the energy for reaching out and building community. But, my Second Life journey is also kind of empty and hollow without owning a piece of land, with things that I’ve built, so …</p>

<p>I found some mainland that I like, I bought just enough that gives me nearly 3000 land impact that I could use, <em>with</em> my store being part of it (because my store <em>has</em> to come first, and <em>must</em> have an in-world location at all times), for a fairly much more decent price. It’s sustainable, and I can at least build <em>something</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/dredge/the_dredge.png" /></p>

<p>I’ve done this a few times before with this place I call “THE DREDGE”, or, a smaller cut of Neo Machina, built to fit a piece of land that isn’t the size of a personal island. Both of the previous times I did it, it was cool, and people were visiting, but! … I went overboard, both times, and was paying for way more land than I needed, and therefore costing <em>too much</em>.</p>

<p>I think I’ve nailed it this time, and am being a bit more methodical about it. Planning what I want to do, what I want to build. Surveying the land that already exists around the land that I <em>do</em> own, and looking at how I can make it look as though it’s connected to the rest of the community.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I’m going to prop up the rentable apartment buildings, just so that people can have at it once again, but I may change it a bit. I remember complaints in the past about having such large spaces available, with small amounts of prims that could be placed, and it does make sense. Why have a huge livable space, but you can only place enough to fill the size of maybe like … a bedroom?</p>

<p>So, maybe I’ll build a <em>new</em> apartment building? We’ll see.</p>

<p>I need to slap down some streets, get these placeholder prims replaced with actual buildings. Figure out what I want to do <em>besides</em> just offer a place for people to live if they should choose.</p>

<p>Do I want to put my little nightclub back? Do I want to try and actually <em>run it</em> this time? Do I want to do something <em>completely different</em> and new?</p>

<p>Whatever it is I decide I want to do, it’ll have to wait until tomorrow to get into real motion, because I have no time to myself tonight! Thank you … offline job.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s the update for now, denizens. I won’t be sharing a link to the land until it’s ready for people to actually visit (although, people who live around the area have already wandered inside to look at this cluster of white placeholders probably thinking, what the hell).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the few hours I have to myself tonight, I’d like to update interested peoples and parties on what’s happening with things I’m building in Second Life.

In fact, I haven’t really played it much since the years that I spent outside of the traditional work-force. And that was back around Path of Fire, and now there’s at least three expansions I’ve missed, and need to catch up on. So I logged the heck on.</p>

<p>What I’ve missed, includes the Champions Ice Brood Saga quest, which seems to go on and on forever (so much so, that I’m taking a break and returning to it tomorrow).</p>

<p>But what I find kind of remarkable is that despite it being 2024, despite most things kind of … sucking ass, and a lot of MMOs and games in-general feeling repetitive, rehashed, polished to the point of being dull, and just not fun, Guild Wars 2 still feels fresh. It feels fresh in the sense that it’s like a portal back to 2014, when things were better. Not … the <em>best</em>, but <em>better</em>.</p>

<p>I wish I could say the same about some of the communities <em>outside</em> of the game, and specifically via Reddit, and into Discord. It seems Reddit moderators are always out to ruin fun, and deploy control fantasies they don’t have the power to employ anywhere else. Being me, posting in the Guild Wars 2 discord asking some of the guilds if they’d be a good fit for me, and <em>immediately</em> getting slapped down and being told I needed to go use the guild recruitment subreddit.</p>

<p>Hey, Reddit mods: Have you ever considered that enforcing hefty restrictions on everything might not be the best way to go about things? That maybe it creates an unwelcoming and hostile atmosphere in an age where it’s <em>much harder</em> to connect with people?</p>

<p>I dunno.</p>

<p>Just spit-balling here.</p>

<p>With that in mind, do I have any Guild Wars 2 players in the United States viewing this blog, or this post? Do ya have a guild? Can I join it?</p>

A new Black Ops is out! You know what that means: It’s time to go hunting zombies. Endlessly. Forever. Without pause. No extraction. Keep fighting. Run out of ammo. Die. This is, at least, <em>my experience</em>, in every Black Ops since number two.</p>

<p>You get your upgrades, you run around flailing your weapons until, <em>eventually</em>, the horde overcomes you, and your team is running around sporadically paying mind to only themselves. Meanwhile you’re thinking about those cool skins and bonus rewards you could’ve gotten for a successful extraction.</p>

<p>If only random pick-up-groups <em>ever wanted to freakin’ extract, ever</em>.</p>

<p>But they don’t.</p>

<p><em>Every single</em> random group I’ve ever joined, <em>never extracts</em>. Most of them don’t know what they’re doing, and if they do, <em>you’re</em> the random. Ten waves. Fifteen waves. Thirty waves. Suddenly it’s time to go do something else, because life comes at you fast.</p>

<p>I remember back during the previous Black Ops, what was it? Black Ops: Synthwave? There was a really neat skin for the operator I liked using the most, and the only way to get it? <em>A successful extraction</em>.</p>

<p>No, I didn’t get it.</p>

<p>And now, because Activision is evil, those rewards I could’ve gotten back then wouldn’t <em>even matter</em> now.</p>

<p>None of it matters.</p>

So, I logged into Second Life and acquired some land, and noticed I could hold a little more. I shot off a ticket to Linden Labs and asked for some more space, because … I’d like to build things. While I sat waiting for a response to this ticket (which I’m <em>still</em> waiting on) I did what any normal person would do. I fully redesigned the way my website responds to different screens.</p>

<p>This is something that I would consider a <em>major milestone</em> in my web development journey, because, for all intents and purposes, you <em>should</em> be able to view it without issue even if you’re on an iPhone 3G. Now, does that mean my CSS is cleaned up and tidy, and there’s nothing left-over that shouldn’t be there? Absolutely not. There is a ton of stuff in there that probably isn’t currently being used, or is conflicting with something else … I just, haven’t had the energy to do <em>all of that</em> just yet.</p>

<p>But I will!</p>

<p>As you can see, on my to-do list.</p>

<p>And, thankfully, I managed to achieve all of this <em>without</em> disrupting the flow of my little vanishing sidebar with all of my links.</p>

<p>What prompted me to do this, though, were a few things. Someone I know on Mastodon tried visiting my website on a phone that is considerably older than an iPhone 15, and it bothered me that this person couldn’t quite see anything correctly, and there was some kind of invisible box blocking off half the content. Upon investigating a few days ago, utilizing the Vivaldi browser developer tools and device simulation, I was able to see exactly that.</p>

<p>Ew.</p>

<p>But, now, not only is that bar <em>gone</em>, or invisible box vaporized, but this website <em>should</em> display completely legibly on <em>anything</em>. Of course, I still have the specific media query setup for tiny screens in portrait mode, which I think works pretty well. But now, if you turn your phone or tablet sideways, it should look <em>great</em>, and give you a glimpse of everything a desktop user can see. Without issue. Hopefully.</p>

<p>Comment on this via the Mastodon link and let me know how it looks for you! Because of the nature of web development, I’m almost <em>sure</em> there’s someone out there who will have some kind of viewing issue. Maybe someone visiting my website from the screen-reader on their refrigerator. Who knows!</p>

<p>But anyway, what to do next? 😈</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I got home from work, and for once wasn’t feeling too tired to even type on my keyboard.

I fully redesigned the way my website responds to different screens.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Call of Duty, On Linux?!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/linux/2024/10/24/call-of-duty-on-linux.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Call of Duty, On Linux?!" /><published>2024-10-24T21:50:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-24T21:50:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/linux/2024/10/24/call-of-duty-on-linux</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/linux/2024/10/24/call-of-duty-on-linux.html"><![CDATA[<p>As some may know, I play Call of Duty sometimes. One of the reasons I briefly switched back to Windows, is <em>because</em> I wanted to do so, and couldn’t on Pop!_OS, despite having purchased pretty much every version of CoD since the <em>original</em> Black Ops 2. But, I ultimately decided that being able to play CoD wasn’t worth the trade-off of … using Windows. That was, until I realized I could play Modern Warfare III, and, presumably, Black Ops 6, on GeForce now. There is … an issue, though.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and you just kind of install Debian, and all your essential apps and then forget about it, and then you load up GeForce Now thinking, “Hey, let’s play some FourthNite,” you’ll run into an issue. A weird issue. An annoying issue.</p>

<p>Your mouse won’t move in a 360 degree rotation.</p>

<p>And let me tell you, there are <em>no</em> resources online that are easily able to be Googled in order to solve this. In fact, I had to track down the GeForce Now flatpak author on Github, and then do some investigating in the issues specifically in relation to <em>that</em> version of the app. Needless to say, I found the answer. And it hadn’t ocurred to me, because, I guess Pop!_OS just does this by default, and that is therefore why I didn’t experience this problem.</p>

<p>You have to use Xorg/X11.</p>

<p>Go to the login screen on Debian, click the gear at the bottom left, and choose Xorg. Do not use Wayland.</p>

<p>I’m not all up in the discourse on Wayland, but this isn’t the <em>only</em> issue it has, and I <em>totally</em> forgot that it has problems.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I can now play Call of Duty on Linux, with minimal input lag via a streaming service. Which is <em>pretty impressive</em>. Albeit, I’m not much of an Nvidia fan (I use Radeon, after-all) due to them basically abandoning gaming and going all-in on melting the Earth’s icecaps by shipping trillions of cards <em>specifically</em> for use in machines that steal art from people, but <strong>whatever</strong>.</p>

<p>Until kernel level anticheat is made illegal, this is what you have to deal with unless you want to use a spyware OS (Windows).</p>

<p>Either way, I wanted to write this down, and put it here, simply because there are <em>very few</em> resources in regards to this topic. But now there’s one, at least.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Linux" /><category term="linux" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As some may know, I play Call of Duty sometimes.

Mostly because, I want to keep writing something almost every single day. You know, personal goals and such. And then I remembered old-school forum banter, and forums in-general. I’m currently a member of a few, but I rarely ever post. I guess new age social media has kind of taken my attention away from such things, unfortunately, but do you remember things like, sharing your wallpapers on a weekly basis? People just snapping photos of their desktops and being like, “Check it out dude.” Peppridge Farm remembers.</p>

<p>Not that anyone can really <em>share</em> anything on my personal site, but I wanted to get back into the tradition of things I used to do online, that I thought was really interesting and cool. Sharing my frikken’ wallpaper.</p>

<p>I think about old forums, how I’d log on in the middle of class at tech while my teacher was trying to … teach me visual basic, and I’d just refresh, refresh, refresh. Kind of like how I refresh my timeline on social media sites nowadays, except I’m not sure what I was looking for back then. People responding to my posts, interesting things to reply to, friendships to make? Do we still make <em>friends</em> online, or are our followers an extension of acquaintanceship?</p>

<p>I’ve thought about using part of the server I have rented over at Digital Ocean to slap down some roots for a modern forum, but would anyone even join? I know the Discourse software is pretty neat, and good, and I’d <em>love</em> to set it up, customize it, make it look neat, maybe even start up some kind of themed email list.</p>

<p>But, I feel like a lot of people have either forgotten forums, or the idea of it is so far away and in the past, that some may <em>not even know</em> what the heck I’m talking about.</p>

<p>“What do you <em>mean</em> post static messages on a board that isn’t constantly flooding me with information overload, and engagement bait?”</p>

<p>Then again, I guess Reddit is sort of a never-ending forum? Message board? Except it’s got random people on it that like to fight with you so that they can feel superior, for, … you know, reasons?</p>

<p>I don’t know. I think back to the early 90s and how my Dad used to dial-in to bulletin boards to talk to people, and I get the feeling this is one of those lost “arts” of the internet that would be really hard to bring back, en masse. So many people posting on things like Tik Tok, which, I can never get used to. What do you mean you gotta share videos of yourself and be perceived at all times in order to participate? Have any of you ever heard of being introverted? Or just, writing text?</p>

<p>Maybe it would be neat to make a new forum, even if it’s <em>just for me</em>.</p>

<p>And maybe I’d post my wallpaper on a weekly basis, call it a public static journal.</p>

<p>Like … like a blog?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been sitting here listening to Spotify most of the evening, browsing the social fediverse, and kind of thinking about things to write on this blog.

Everything’s a swiper, everyone’s making decisions based on appearances, and nothing else. Most of the accounts on these apps are like, 2% real people, and 98% bots, Instagram account spammers, scammers waiting for you in a motel with a baseball bat and some dude, and couples looking for a unicorn. It’s dire out there, brosefinas.</p>

<p>But there’s this one dating app that kind of emerged way back, and now they’re spending money for ad revenue, billing themselves as the app that’s <em>not like the other apps</em>, with ads that feature cartoon dudes talking about how all the other apps (Tinder, Bumble) are all about beauty pageants. How they’re not fun anymore, they’re all scams. How they keep swiping daily, more as a last-ditch hope that <em>someday</em>, they get lucky.</p>

<p>It’s aiming itself directly at lonely guys, and, okay, sure. There are <em>a lot of lonely guys</em>. And, I mean, <em>some</em> of them are lonely for good reason.</p>

<p>I decided to give a shot, though. Because, hey, they’re not like the other apps, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/boo/boo.avif" />

<p><br /></p>

<p>It’s true: Most dating apps in 2024 are a scam. They don’t exist to match you with anyone. They don’t exist to <em>be deleted</em>. They exist to <em>extract as much money as possible</em> out of you, in the exploitation of your loneliness, and hopes of ever finding love. And with the way offline life has gone since the pandemic, meeting online is <em>also</em> becoming one of the only ways to … genuinely connect with someone.</p>

<p>According to this <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2019/08/online-dating-popular-way-u-s-couples-meet#:~:text=Matchmaking%20is%20now%20the%20primary,and%20contributed%20to%20the%20research." target="_blank">National Academy of Sciences study</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Rosenfeld found that heterosexual couples are more likely to meet a romantic partner online than through personal contacts and connections. Since 1940, traditional ways of meeting partners – through family, in church and in the neighborhood – have all been in decline, Rosenfeld said.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rosenfeld, a lead author on the research and a professor of sociology in the School of Humanities and Sciences, drew on a nationally representative 2017 survey of American adults and found that about 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting their partner online, compared to 22 percent in 2009. Sonia Hausen, a graduate student in sociology, was a co-author of the paper and contributed to the research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes on to talk about how, with online dating, people have a <em>much larger</em> pool of potential partners to choose from, and this is basically why online dating has become the full and total norm (at least, if you’re fully straight, which I am <em>not</em>).</p>

<p>So … then why is there a loneliness epidemic? Why is this app titled “Boo” advertising itself by calling other apps scams.</p>

<p>It’s because, like I said, <em>they are.</em></p>

<p>But Boo’s not much any better.</p>

<p>Sure, you can <em>actually</em> match with people, and potentially start conversations. You can select from a large amount of profile information to make matching easier. You can make posts as if you’re on some kind of social media website, and swipe left and right, just like on all the other apps.</p>

<p>Until they hit you with the, “36 dollars a month, please” ask.</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/boo/37.png" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Come to think of it … you can talk to people on Tinder. You can talk to people on Bumble.</p>

<p>It’s that, <em>usually</em>, when the time comes to talk, most people <em>don’t</em>. But that’s besides the point of the issue here.</p>

<p>The issue, is that these apps think they’re worth as much as Apple Premium, for almost <em>no features</em>.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but being able to continuously match with potential partners, and message to my heart’s content is <em>not worth</em> nearly the cost of two Doordash orders per month. It’s not worth the cost of a Crumbl cookie. It’s not worth the cost of running a 500 user Mastodon instance.</p>

<p>People <em>must</em> actually be paying these fees for things you used to be able to do for free in 2012 on dating websites, and that’s just <em>sad</em>, dude. <strong>Stop</strong> paying these companies nearly 40 to 50 dollars a month, and go sign up for like, I don’t know, an anime box? A handful of streaming services? A monthly motel room to sit alone by yourself and watch TV on a foreign bed?</p>

<p>Do <em>anything</em>, besides rewarding these soul-sucking companies for being machines of exploitation. And I’m talking about <em>you</em>, too, Boo.</p>

<p>“We’re not like the other apps.”</p>

<p>Yeah, you’re not.</p>

<p>Most of the other apps aren’t trying to convince people they totally aren’t run by scum of the Earth, grifters.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier in the year I wrote about the terrible situation that is dating in the post-2020 world.
