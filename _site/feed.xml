I’m mostly doing this because I’ve allowed some of my bills to get out of control, and I’m paying for things I really don’t need to be. After using Neocities for a <em>long time</em>, I’ve found the social aspect isn’t really … worth it. People don’t really pay any attention to website feeds on there. And, even <em>with</em> the allowed 50 gigs of space on Neocities, you’re <em>still limited to the suggested 1 gig limit on Github</em>.</p>

<p>So, I figured, “Why don’t I just keep this on Github and stop having my website in two separate places???” And hence, I did.</p>

<p>But, I’m mostly writing this post right now to see if my “post to mastodon” script works, <em>without</em> the deploy-to-neocities step in the workflow (which it should). I’ll only know though, once I hit that commit button.</p>

I think, or I’m pretty <em>sure</em> that’s when I first joined Mastodon. It was back on my mastodon.social days, because, well, I’m not sure there were as many privately run instances, and this was before I launched a GNU Social instance (wish I would’ve found a way to keep it, would be awesome to still have it). But one of the first things that caught my attention wasn’t really the UI, or the diversity of people and ideas on my timeline as I gradually followed those I was interested in seeing. It was, in fact, the federated timeline that kept me captivated.</p>

<p>You can see this, now, on pretty much <em>all</em> ActivityPub software (aside from like Pixelfed, I think?), but to me, when I first saw it, it was like the first time I played an MMO. It was mesmerizing. I came from Twitter where what I saw were random people that an algorithm decided to feed to me. Usually, it was <em>always</em> some junk meant to make you mad, to get you angry, so that you’d engage, and keep you on their site longer, and longer (and it worked, for a long time). But, seeing <em>all</em> of the people an instance was connected to, across probably <em>all of the instances that existed at the time</em>, was freakin’ wild.</p>

<p>This was back when I was still out-of-work and suffering from some <em>major</em> anxiety and agoraphobia issues, so I had some time on my hands.</p>

<p>I think, the very first time, I spent an <em>entire night</em> watching people zoom by with whatever thoughts they were shooting out into the void.</p>

<p>Like logging onto my Night Elf for the first time in 2004 World of Warcraft, it was something <em>I had never seen before</em>. People, unfiltered, non-algorithmic, just living in the social media moment.</p>

<p>This isn’t something you can get on Bluesky, as much as the devs tout what their idea of “decentralization” is. Bluesky is very much just Twitter, but with a PDS that lets you store media and a handle.</p>

<p>But, on my <em>own</em> instance now (again, and self-hosted), the timeline isn’t <em>as fast</em> as it was when I was on .social in 2017, and this is largely due-in-part to the fact that I block <em>many</em> instances with negative, bad, or sometimes illegal content. The last time I saw the .social timeline, they were … let’s say, a lot more <em>lax</em> about what they allowed through the pipeline.</p>

<p>I’m not.</p>

<p>I pay for this server, and so I keep the fungal mass out.</p>

<p>If you haven’t really experienced this, I <em>highly</em> recommend you turn on the advanced web interface for Mastodon, and then watch as the thoughts stream by. Maybe you’re on a big instance and it’ll be like a waterfall, or you’re like me on a smaller instance, and it’s more like a dripfeed.</p>

<p>Whichever.</p>

<p>The thing though, <em>most</em> of the mobile apps have this too … except for the <em>official Mastodon app</em>. For real. One of the most <em>unique</em> things about ActivityPub, and it’s not included in the official app? To me, that’s kind of a fumble.</p>

<p>Why isn’t it there? Too much a chance people might see things that are bad for Apple policy? Things that could be rectified by … correctly moderating who you’re federating with?</p>

<p>Either way, that’s my piece of it. I enjoy seeing people’s thoughts stream by, even if I don’t interact with most of them, and now I have an idea for a potential <em>different</em> feature on this website (haha).</p>

<p>Good night, I’m going to turn on some ambient and zone out.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Mastodon" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the day, we’ll say 2017?

For ease of listening, ease of discovering, and ease of use, in-general. And that’s how they getcha. They make it as easy and seamless as possible, so that you’ll protest less when they announce things like, “We’re not going to pay artists anymore.” (<a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/confirmed-next-year-tracks-on-spotify-1000-plays/" target="_blank">since November 2023</a>) And maybe this doesn’t mean much for artists who make new music, and then upload to streaming, and then receive billions of streams with little effort … but it’s important to <em>everyone else</em>.</p>

<p>I’m intentionally writing this on <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Bandcamp Friday</a>, because a single sale on Bandcamp is equal to something like <em>three years of streaming</em> an artist’s work on Spotify. <strong><em>Three years</em></strong>. I’m not trying to lend any weight to Metallica of the early 00s who rallied against Napster due to them believing that a downloaded album is a loss of payment, because <em>it’s not</em> (if someone can’t or doesn’t plan to buy your music, and pirates it instead, it’s obviously not a lost sale). But, when you can, and <em>if</em> you can, you <em>should buy the music that you enjoy</em>.</p>

<p>On top of that, <a href="https://www.mountbonnell.info/joes-austin/joe-rogan-secures-multiyear-deal-to-continue-exclusive-spotify-partnership" target="_blank">Spotify and Joe Rogan</a> have an exclusive streaming deal that goes on through 2025, and if you’ve been alive and awake for the past seven or eight years, you already know why Joe Rogan is a guy who sucks and is a pile of garbage.</p>

<p>But maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, in this new era, we can convince ourselves that just because something is easy, or just because it’s something billions of people do, doesn’t mean it’s something <em>we have to do</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re an Apple fan, <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a> pays all artists, regardless of amount of streams, and I believe <a href="https://tidal.com/" target="_blank">Tidal</a> and even <a href="https://music.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube Music</a> does, as well!</p>

<p>I’m personally a fan of Apple Music, but mainly because all of my devices <em>are from Apple</em>, except for my Linux PC, and Dell laptop that I’ve got Debian 12 running on. And Apple also does another thing that makes total sense, and <em>separates</em> Podcasts in a different app, so that you aren’t shuffling around music and podcasts at the same time (yes, I’ve used Spotify and felt really cumbersome tapping around both types of media). But, you don’t <em>have</em> to use Apple stuff, you can just use one of the other ones I mentioned, … even though Google isn’t exactly a great company anymore, either.</p>

<p>Regardless, buy the music you like, stop using farking Spotify, for the love of garsh, and support artists in your day-to-day life. Make it something like … a 2025 resolution.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Spotify" /><category term="spotify" /><category term="wrapped" /><category term="music" /><category term="streaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no secret that people love Spotify.

In my ActivityPub distro-hopping adventures, I’ve installed Mastodon onto a VPS, and switched back. Not because Sharkey is <em>bad</em>, or not to my liking. It’s great! But I can’t keep myself away from the Mastodon software. Even if Sharkey has some advantages over it.</p>

<p>Mastodon, for sure, isn’t perfect. But I find myself having to think about <em>a lot less</em> when I’m running my own instance. In fact, I’ve done it so many times, I think it took me 20 minutes to setup the instance, and get everything configured correctly? Not that it was <em>hard</em> to setup Sharkey, but I’m getting good at this. My one issue with Sharkey, is that scaling means basically crippling your instance to have to reset all files for local and remote users to keep cache and bandwidth down, and without an automated way to do this, well.</p>

<p>As you know, I am a tired person.</p>

<p>I have Mastodon running with a cron task that just kills media attachment cache once every 7 days, I have the database tuned to the correct stats for the server I’m running on Debian, and I’m storing all remaining media attachments on an S3 bucket.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>I’m finished.</p>

<p>I’m so tired my eye is twitching.</p>

You buy 400 games on Steam, but ultimately you end up back in a Blizzard game. Or, … in this day and age, an ActiBlizzard game. Or, in this specific day and age, <em>Diablo 4</em>, so that you can prove you’re better than Elon Musk.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/diablo/load.png" /></p>

<p>No, I won’t elaborate on that.</p>

<p>But I’ve been playing a lot of Diablo 4. I’m beyond level 50 now! Which is more than I can say for myself when the game <em>actually released</em>.</p>

<p>Playing <em>this game</em>, though, kind of makes Diablo 3 look like something I’m unsure how I ever enjoyed. I did, of course, but 4 is so much prettier, and <em>darker</em>, and also I’m a Necromancer and everything I touch dies in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Yes, bosses, too.</p>

<p>Diablo is something that goes back. Way back. It was one of the games I started playing after Doom and Quake finally started to get kinda <em>old</em> feeling, to me. You know, back in like 1997. You see, my uncle and cousin used to play Diablo 1, and eventually, Diablo 2 together all the time. And I wanted to join them.</p>

<p><em>I just wasn’t all that good at it</em>, and I didn’t have any money to buy these games.</p>

<p>I did, however, get hold of Diablo 1. And I think back to one of my first, and last experiences with the game. A player, lending me his sword. It was powerful. I had <em>nothing</em>. I was just … a noob. I don’t even think I was halfway to whatever max level was back then.</p>

<p>I certainly wasn’t anywhere <em>near</em> hell.</p>

<p>But I needed a weapon. One that was good. And this guy was willing to lend me his sword until I found something better.</p>

<p>“Here, you can use my sword for a while.” I paraphrased. “I’ll be on tomorrow!”</p>

<p>And then I logged off.</p>

<p>And then I never logged on again, <em>ever</em> (if you’re out there, I’ll give you a new sword in Diablo 4).</p>

<p>I got more serious when it came to Diablo 2, but I was still largely, <em>no good, and also crap</em>.</p>

<p>And then flash forward to Diablo 4, I’m alright, I guess.</p>

<iframe title="Diablo 4 is Easy" width="560" height="315" src="https://video.infosec.exchange/videos/embed/98c11475-fa49-4876-9908-2f1fea5bbe5f" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe>

<p>Through D3 and D4, though, I <em>do</em> find it continually strange, as my Necromancer draws no fear from other people, and in Diablo 4, my Necro speaks about the “light,” and heaven.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I’m here like, … wouldn’t the Necromancer be on Lillith’s side?</p>

<p>Then again, I haven’t even finished act 1 (I spend a lot of time wandering and doing mostly nothing but side quests and killing bosses).</p>

<p>I think if Blizzard ever made a new MMO, they should just do it with this. I mean, that’s basically what it is at this point.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s the post. I just wanted to say, “Hey, Diablo 4 is pretty cool.”</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="diablo4" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="blizzard" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s a tale as old as time.

Now that I’ve done that, it’s time to get back to work in figuring out how I can integrate my Sharkey instance into my website (such as like inserting my post feed into a side-bar, having trending topics on my side-bar, and so on).</p>

<p>What I would like to mention, since they’ve been pretty awesome since I started with them, and up until yesterday when I decided to turn off the instance: <a href="https://toot.io/mastodon_hosting.html" target="_blank">Toot.io</a></p>

<p>These guys have provided an <em>extremely</em> solid Mastodon experience for me for most of the year. Little to <em>no</em> issues, elastic search built-in, on-time updates, and <em>even when I was having some financial issues</em>, they worked with me in order to keep my instance from making me go broke in the short term.</p>

<p>I’m now currently running my own copy of Sharkey over at Elest.io, and they’ve been alright so far, but the experience is mostly <em>in my own hands</em>, since I now maintain the instance, plus the structure behind it.</p>

<p>But! If you’re interested in hosting a very simple Mastodon instance, and want <em>little</em> to fuss with, or even <em>setup</em>, I highly recommend Toot.io hosting. I even felt kind of bad turning off my Mastodon instance, <em>just because</em> they’ve been so good this whole time. But I yearned for more, and Sharkey has the more I’m looking for.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean <em>you</em> should launch your own instance of alternative ActivityPub software, though! If you’re <em>new</em> to this, and maybe don’t know how to use a command line, or a terminal, <em>absolutely</em> get yourself some managed hosting.</p>

And I thought to myself, “I wonder what it would be like to launch a Sharkey instance?” And so I did! And, while I <em>have</em> had prior experience with Sharkey … I like to run things myself. I like to tinker with them. And now I have a full Sharkey instance, <em>that I can surely edit to my liking on the command line</em>.</p>

<p>But, and I mean, Mastodon is great, but! Sharkey has <em>a lot</em> more customization options, <em>a lot</em> more <em>everything</em>. And because I’m pretty much an advanced fediverse user, I figured, “Hell yeah, let’s do it.” So, I’m migrating everything to my new Sharkey instance at <a href="https://sharkey.mkultra.monster" target="_blank">sharkey.mkultra.monster</a>, and once I feel like it won’t break anything, I’ll likely be turning off the Mastodon instance. The sharkey instance is <em>also</em> cheaper, and I need to save my money.</p>

<p>I’ve also got just about <em>every single</em> script I’ve made, hosted on a Digital Ocean VPS, working correctly and posting to the new instance, <em>including</em> the auto-posting this blog does once I hit commit!</p>

<p>The only downside, is posts aren’t going to have comments until I figure out a different way to do them, and some of the elements on my sidebars here are commented out until I design a <em>different</em> way to display my presence on the fediverse.</p>

<p>All-in-all, this is <em>really</em> cool, and I’m sure I’ll spend countless hours redoing scripts to interface with Sharkey (lol oh god).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Sharkey" /><category term="sharkey" /><category term="activitypub" /><category term="socialmedia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I was messing around with a Linux VPS, like you do.
