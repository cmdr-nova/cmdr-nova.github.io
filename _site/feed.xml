Or, if there even <em>is</em> a timeline. Anyway, let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into the 1993 classic, DOOM.</p>

<center><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/doom/doom.png" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>So, basically, all this time, I‚Äôve been extremely confused about whether or not you‚Äôre the same guy in <em>every Doom game ever made</em>. The short answer is: Yes, you are.</p>

<p>But, I feel like I can‚Äôt talk about the lore of all of Doom, without quoting the original opening fiction that started it all (quoted from the fandom wiki).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In DOOM, you‚Äôre a space marine, one of Earth‚Äôs toughest, hardened in combat and trained for action. Three years ago you assaulted a superior officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians. He and his body cast were shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home of the Union Aerospace Corporation. The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos. With no action for fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin‚Äô dust and watchin‚Äô restricted flicks in the rec room.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the last four years the military, UAC‚Äôs biggest supplier, has used the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various secret projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel. So far they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos, throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other. Recently however, the gateways have grown dangerously unstable. Military ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù entering them have either disappeared or been stricken with a strange form of insanity‚Äìbabbling vulgarities, bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering an untimely death of full-body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to send home to the folks became a full-time job. Latest military reports state that the research is suffering a small setback, but everything is under control.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos. ‚ÄúWe require immediate military support. Something fraggin‚Äô evil is coming out of the gateways! Computer systems have gone berserk!‚Äù The rest was incoherent. Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky. Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been unsuccessful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles were sent up pronto to Phobos. You were ordered to secure the perimeter of the base while the rest of the team went inside. For several hours, your radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders, screams, bones cracking, then finally silence. Seems your buddies are dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Things aren‚Äôt looking too good. You‚Äôll never navigate off the planet on your own. Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by the assault team leaving you only with a pistol. If only you could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in the forehead. Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls echoing throughout the distant corridors. They know you‚Äôre here. There‚Äôs no turning back now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúThis game came <em>before</em> Quake, and it already has a much more fleshed out story?‚Äù Yeah, kinda weird, right? It continues on like this, into a book, onto Earth, as the invasion of Hell continues, into Doom 64 where you <em>return</em> to Hell, then to Doom 2016 where you‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ entombed, and then awoken in an alternate reality, and it just keeps going.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a kid, I was only partially aware of all this lore. In fact, I think the <em>only</em> thing I paid attention to was the Doom guy holding his rabbit‚Äôs severed head at the end of the game. Oh, and the nightmares I had where, in the middle of the night, I actually hallucinated Lost Souls flying in and out of my room, and it was <em>terrifying</em> at the time (I think I was forced to take a break from the game at this point).</p>

<p>But did you know Doom guy had a family? And that family was <em>murdered</em> by Demons? Did you know there was a theatrical recreation of Doom that starts off with transphobia, and then explains away the demons completely by being like, ‚ÄúOh, no it‚Äôs not demons. It‚Äôs humans infected with another chromosome.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt like that movie much, aside from the strange inclusion of the game-dev‚Äôs names, as characters, <em>in the movie</em>.</p>

<p>Did you know that, according to the official Doom <em>book</em>, the Doom marine‚Äôs name is Corporal Flynn Taggart? I‚Äôm not sure this is ever held up as canon <em>anywhere</em> else, but it‚Äôs a neat little tidbit. The book itself had two nebula nominees, and here‚Äôs the synopsis for you ‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Gates were there on Phobos when mankind first arrived. Inert, unyielding, impossibly alien constructs, for twenty years they sat lifeless, mute testaments to their long-vanished creators, their secrets hidden. Then one day, they sprang to life . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meet Corporal Flynn Taggart, United States Marine Corps; serial number 888-23-9912. He‚Äôs the best warrior the twenty-first century has to offer, which is a damn good thing. Because Flynn Taggart is all that‚Äôs standing between the hell that just dropped in on Mars and an unsuspecting planet Earth . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm more quoting, and reflecting on all of this, because, I‚Äôm just now really discovering just <em>how much</em> lore there actually is behind Doom, and finding that it really doesn‚Äôt need a whole lot of discussion and deep dives. But, I do think I want to finally <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knee-Deep-Dead-Doom-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00AK804G2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TT58OFRGFPXO&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fDVPBGj8GSwKTLST0HjuWj1_OB3f3f6ldm6ByBR6v4icAFYf6TCycjAc0mMZC4q-L6VQpmQR1I_CDWJdp5h59kYjsnIbqH1dWdCFyVJYjodqgNUAreHnJFsJRNbeMx0DB14OlDPzOIDpYzMJtXWH9K4lVnNpbiRJPRQUiJDfpD3DBnk3NyzSDggC0kQMT4G32ZuyXledSfzbDzu_GmxL7Ge_P4ZwUqMITzLXFAyJuHc.QtP3uvPIL5jOTvZFEKB40R8anAcB5CAtP22mmK5vSCo&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=doom+book&amp;qid=1728956960&amp;sprefix=doom+boo%2Caps%2C133&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">read that book</a>.</p>

<p>Never-the-less, this is kind of where my obsession with gaming <em>really</em> started. Sure, there was Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone, Commander Keen, Ja ‚Ä¶ Jazz JackRabbit? But then there was DOOM. And then fond memories watching my Dad play Quake FTP multiplayer against one of his friends, and then me being <em>absolutely badass</em> in Quake 2 multiplayer ‚Ä¶ and then finding I SUCKED HARD in Quake 3 multiplayer (because they completely changed the way the game felt, controlled, and aimed).</p>

<p>My entire childhood was me, waiting for school to be over, so that I could dive back into <em>one of these games</em>. And, despite my delve into coding at the age of 39, I find it strange I never just, you know, <em>started making my own games</em>. At least, until I started making this Mafia Wars clone, that I absolutely <em>am not</em> going to continue, because I don‚Äôt think I have the correct know-how to securely store people‚Äôs usernames and passwords on an encrypted database, on a server that can‚Äôt <em>easily be hacked</em>. But ‚Ä¶ maybe there is room for something <em>else.</em></p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/doom/mafia_wars.png" /></p>

<p>(Yes, this is an actual semi-functional clone of Mafia Wars, that can only be played by me, on my HDD, and I will never release it to the public lol)</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I wrote about Quake and, by extension, Quake 2‚Äôs lore.

Obviously, we‚Äôre going to skip Quake 3, not because it isn‚Äôt good (it‚Äôs one of the greatest arena shooters of all time), but because its story is more that of Unreal Tournament. In that, it‚Äôs just people from different dimensions fighting in nonstop deathmatch.</p>

<p>But ‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôve ever seen those memes online where people poke fun at games where they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúHey, who‚Äôs John Darksouls?‚Äù and someone‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the main character of Dark Souls, cousin of John Halo.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre going to love the story behind Quake 1.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/quake/quake.png" /></p>

<p>The background, according <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Story#The_Story" target="_blank">to the Wiki</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get the phone call at 4 a.m. By 5:30 you‚Äôre in the secret installation. The commander explains tersely, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the Slipgate device. Once we perfect these, we‚Äôll be able to use them to transport people and cargo from one place to another instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAn enemy codenamed Quake, [sic] is using his own slipgates to insert death squads inside our bases to kill, steal, and kidnap.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe hell of it is we have no idea where he‚Äôs from. Our top scientists think Quake‚Äôs not from Earth, but another dimension. They say Quake‚Äôs preparing to unleash his real army, whatever that is.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre our best man. This is Operation Counterstrike and you‚Äôre in charge. Find Quake, and stop him ‚Ä¶ or it ‚Ä¶ You have full authority to requisition anything you need. If the eggheads are right, all our lives are expendable.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that‚Äôs not all!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While scouting the neighborhood, you hear shots back at the base. Damn, that Quake bastard works fast! He heard about Operation Counterstrike, and hit first. Racing back, you see the place is overrun. You are almost certainly the only survivor. Operation Counterstrike is over. Except for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know that the heart of the installation holds a slipgate. Since Quake‚Äôs killers came through, it is still set to his dimension. You can use it to get loose in his hometown. Maybe you can get to the asshole personally. You pump a round into your shotgun, and get moving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that‚Äôs it! I mean, obviously, it continues a bit into the actual game, where you‚Äôre traversing different dimensions and collecting runes ‚Ä¶ killing enemies like something out of Lovecraft, but in its most basic sense, and I mean no offense to those who worked or work for ID Software and on this game, but if I didn‚Äôt know what Quake was, I would assume this was a sixth grader‚Äôs creative writing homework. I mean, it just starts talking at you, as if you <em>already</em> know what‚Äôs going on? It starts out in 2nd-person perspective and never leaves that narrative. And then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúOperation Counterstrike,‚Äù which makes me wonder where the original devs behind CounterStrike got their game‚Äôs name from.</p>

<p>Especially because Team Fortress was <em>originally</em> a Quake multiplayer mod made by the community (in the 90s).</p>

<p>I wanted to read through all of this, because I <em>also</em> didn‚Äôt understand the connection between <em>this game</em>, and the second game, where we‚Äôre suddenly invading the Strogg‚Äôs home planet, and there‚Äôs me thinking, ‚ÄúWho the heck are the Strogg, again?‚Äù</p>

<p>The short answer to that question, is: The Strogg and Quake 2 have almost <em>nothing</em> to do with Quake 1. It‚Äôs a restart, and I kind of found that a little disappointing. The <em>theme</em> of Quake 1 is really cool, and it feels a bit more linked to Doom in the way it handles its world ‚Ä¶ even if the lore <em>really</em> leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>Quake 2‚Äôs basic lore (via this <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_II#The_Story" target="_blank">Wiki</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quake II takes place in a futuristic sci-fi environment. During the single player campaign, you take the role of a Marine called Bitterman, taking part in ‚ÄúOperation Alien Overlord‚Äù, attempting to save Earth from the Strogg invasion by counter-attacking their planet, Stroggos. During the first attack on Stroggos, the Big Gun strikes down most of the Marine pods with a powerful EMP blast. This causes most of the pods to crash land (many miles from their target landing zones). Most of the Marines are captured or killed, but Bitterman is one of the lucky few to survive. He finds himself many miles from the Big Gun in a Strogg base on the outskirts of the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>almost</em> sounds like they retconned the enemy‚Äôs name to be Strogg, (pronounced stroeg), rather than John Quake, the main antagonist of planet Quake, from Quake.</p>

<p>And I guess, if you think of it in that way, it makes a <em>little</em> more sense. The Strogg invasion of Earth ‚Ä¶ could be considered parallel to ‚ÄúQuake‚Äôs‚Äù invasion of a military base, and therefore ‚Ä¶ Earth. Maybe. But, I‚Äôm just kind of inserting my own canon into something that‚Äôs been over and done with for <em>decades</em>.</p>

<p>The subsequent games all follow strings of lore from Quake 2 (mostly), and I think only Quake 3 acknowledges Quake 1. Which, <em>again</em>, is a shame. I definitely feel like ID should come back for another full Quake release, and give us some continuity here. Even if it only matters to like ‚Ä¶ five people.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, today, I was playing Quake 1 and 2, and something ocurred to me, that hadn‚Äôt ever ocurred to me in the 28 to 30 years that these games have been a thing: I‚Äôve never fully understood what in the hell the story is supposed to be.

<p>If I wasn‚Äôt feeling so much like a dumpster full of garbage, I would have made the progress a little more coherent, but I have an idea for a chorus type melody that I want to put on that little break in-between the main section. I just ‚Ä¶ need to dig out PG8-x, wherever the hell it went, and get it setup again.</p>

<p>Which, I‚Äôll do when I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm <em>literally dying</em>.</p>

Do you miss that? Oh, yeah, me either. But, the old part of Twitter I‚Äôm actually talking about here, are the bots that people used to setup, that read from their tweets, and then shot out a randomized post. I think some of them were called like, ‚ÄúJohn Reads‚Äù or ‚ÄúJohn Books‚Äù, wherein they‚Äôd put their name and qualify it with something related to writing or reading. Either way, remember that? Do ya?</p>

<p>Well, I recreated that in a bot, that reads from a spreadsheet of your posts, jumbles it, randomizes it, restructures it, and then posts them semi-logically, to <em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/post_gen_bot" target="_blank">post_gen_bot on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, in my use-case for this, I have it reading from Google Sheets I‚Äôve generated as backups of every single post I‚Äôve made to Mastodon since the beginning of 2024, because ‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know what to do with all of that, <em>until now</em>. But, I‚Äôm assuming, if you really wanted to, you could feed your old backed-up tweets from a deleted Twitter account, <em>into this bot</em>, and then have it post jumbled nonsense from your posting-past on social media.</p>

<p>That‚Äôd be kinda neat, right?</p>

<p>Now, this is like the 4th or 5th bot I‚Äôve made? I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm losing count already.</p>

<p>But, I <em>have</em> had a little bit of aggression directed toward me via the fediverse. Because, some people just don‚Äôt think. They don‚Äôt consider what they‚Äôre doing, or read what they‚Äôre targeting. They don‚Äôt particularly <em>care</em> if you‚Äôve spent time making something interesting, or neat, and would simply request that you mute, delete, and ban your work.</p>

<p>To those people, I say, lighten the frikk up. Don‚Äôt waste your reports, just use the <em>mute</em> function. I don‚Äôt make these things to please other people, or to meet your expectations or specific specifications of what <em>you personally</em> believe the fediverse should be. I do this <em>for me</em>. And if you don‚Äôt like that, <em>you don‚Äôt have to see it.</em></p>

<p>It reminds me of years back, on another Mastodon account, where I was posting about Tomb Raider and how cool the iteration of the game I was playing, happened to be, and this ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to call them ‚Äúextremely online,‚Äù because there was something <em>else</em> wrong with them, entirely, but this person came into my notifications, and they were like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about Tomb Raider, why are you talking about this?‚Äù</p>

<p>And I was taken aback, like ‚Ä¶ There are legitimately people out there who fully and completely believe the entire world, and everyone in it, revolves around <em>them</em>, specifically. And that‚Äôs frikken <em>nuts</em>.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think this is a problem that only exists on Mastodon, though. I think this is wide-spread, across all of social media, and the internet, and it‚Äôs only been exasperated by a society that celebrates individualism and isolation, and so on, and so forth. I could go on for hours, but this is a topic for another time.</p>

<p>Either way, for those that like bots, here‚Äôs another one for you.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember on Twitter, back in the golden days, when the worst part of the website were the people who were addicted to finding things they thought were bad about other people, and then creating dunk posts, and dogpiles?

I started screwing around with Python after spending time casually reading about it, and decided to learn it, hands-on, and I smashed up a slew of interesting things. Then, I started thinking about, despite my love for Linux, and especially Debian, there are some critical things I still don‚Äôt have access to while <em>on</em> Linux.</p>

<p>Such as things I use for my creations in Second Life, like Quixel, Marvelous Designer. And how I‚Äôm basically <em>locked</em> to only using Gimp. And, regrettably, there <em>are</em> a few games I want to play that I just can‚Äôt. With these things in mind, I decided to mess around and put Windows on my System76 machine. It wasn‚Äôt all <em>that</em> painful, because I have all of my important stuff backed up on the cloud, and I don‚Äôt mind redownloading games as I decide I‚Äôm interested in playing them.</p>

<p>But ‚Ä¶ And this could end up being the reason I decide to just put Linux back onto my PC: Turning Windows into a machine for a developer is a <em>pain in the ass</em>.</p>

<p>From configuring SSH, to realizing I didn‚Äôt have OpenSSH, to installing OpenSSH, to configuring PowerShell, to downloading the actual latest version, to screwing with SSH keys, to adding, deleting, adding, deleting, adding, deleting, and adding and deleting about 15 different keys, before I generated a new one, and then <em>manually pasted the key</em> into the authorizations <em>on my Debian server</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, but then there‚Äôs VS Code ‚Ä¶ An apparent Microsoft centric developer app, that crashes against a wall as soon as you try to push and sync? Because apparently, or at least in my case, it doesn‚Äôt know to <em>use OpenSSH</em>?!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here I am, with access to all of my games, and every single program I used to use, and <em>also</em> my developer tools setup exactly the same way they were in Pop!_OS.</p>

<p>I do have to say that I really like Pop!_OS, but I‚Äôm <em>not</em> that excited about merging and migrating my entire system to the Rust based COSMIC. I don‚Äôt know. I ‚Ä¶ kind of like Ubuntu, you know?</p>

<p>All that aside, we‚Äôll see how long this lasts. Despite the shortcomings, Linux is really a revolutionary OS, and I‚Äôll probably put it all back sometime in the future. Probably when I get tired of the games I wanted to play, and decide to figure out the workarounds for the apps I want to use in Windows (I don‚Äôt like using Virtual Machines, I just want to interact with my actual PC).</p>

<p>But, until then, I‚Äôm going to see how far I can stretch Windows into giving me control of the system.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, it‚Äôs been an interesting week and a half.

So I spent some time trying to figure out how to make and rebuild Mafia Wars from the ground-up. I achieved ‚Ä¶ some things, but it‚Äôs proving to be something that will take a long time, and I kinda just wanna chill and have some fun? So, I made it so that my Reddit-Bot also posts random status (which are predefined), that are pulled from a json file.</p>

<p>As it turns out, small-time bots are a little bit easier. The way that I accomplished this, was by making a <em>secondary</em> bot, that uses the same Mastodon access codes, and runs every 13 minutes, outside of the 10 minute window that the Reddit bot uses (simulating what a normal person might post like ‚Ä¶ if they were a bot).</p>

<p>You can see the Chatter-Bot <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/chatter-bot" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm aware that all these little worker-bots I‚Äôve built have all been built before, albeit, probably in different ways, and with different code. But these all <em>also</em> work, and they do specific things that I‚Äôm sure the others probably don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>I updated the Reddit-Post bot to include Reddit usernames and the subreddit that they came from (so that it‚Äôs more clear), and I made it so the bot will periodically look for followers, and follow new follows plus unfollow defollows (emulating a real influencer!).</p>

<p>As far as the Chatter-Bot goes, it also has embedded replies that it‚Äôll shoot at you if you send it a mention. This is structured much the same way the status posts are, except they‚Äôre only used when someone goes, ‚ÄúHey @net_run@mkultra.monster, what the hell are you on about?‚Äù</p>

<p>Now ‚Ä¶ in regards to my ‚ÄúMafia Hustle‚Äù Mafia Wars clone, uh. Yeah, I‚Äôm just gonna set that aside for now!

<p>Have you ever thought to yourself, ‚ÄúMan, why do I have to copy/paste blog post links and then also post them? I have more important things to do, like jorkin it in the club, you know, with my peanuts.‚Äù</p>

<p>Well, friend, you are in luck today.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Of course, you can give him a new name, like ‚ÄúBarry‚Äù or ‚ÄúFart Face.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter to me!</p>

<p>I still have lots to learn, and I‚Äôm starting to retain more and more as I do this, but I realize that programming is a very large and long road. Heck. I‚Äôve been screwing with HTML since about 1999, and I still have to keep Google open to reference CSS modules and what-not. Plus, I‚Äôm getting older, and stuff just slips out of my brain juice and then it‚Äôs gone with the wind.</p>

<p>Either way, that‚Äôs all I have to write about for now, cause tomorrow‚Äôs my day off from my offline job, and I‚Äôm about to chill, and do nothing. Or make a 4th bot.

<p>You heard me.</p>

<p>When there is no more room in hell, the anime boobs will walk the Mastodon.</p>

<p>Obviously, there is some room for failure here. Failure, in that, sometimes people post AI-generated sludge to Reddit, and that <em>may</em> get caught in the bot. If it happens too often, I‚Äôll either figure out how to exclude that stuff, or just not include that specific subreddit in the bot‚Äôs pull.</p>

<p>This is sort of still ongoing, too. I tried a bunch of different tricks to get the bot to stop posting the preview, tiny, pixelated image, but to no avail. Or, maybe to vail. It <em>may</em> be just my instance that isn‚Äôt uploading them correctly, but I‚Äôm not sure yet.</p>

<p>If you want to see the bot directly, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/@net_run" target="_blank">it‚Äôs here</a>. Warning, though, some of the posts it grabs are NSFW and entirely lewd. You have been warned.</p>

<p>This is pretty cool, though, because, the last time I did <em>anything</em> like this, it was a <strong>chatbot</strong> that I integrated with a <a href="https://gnusocial.network" target="_blank">GNU Social</a> (still around today) instance I was running, way, way back in ‚Ä¶ 2017, I think?</p>

<p>I personally haven‚Äôt seen, heard, or noticed any detrimental effects of Bandcamp being bought-out, but it‚Äôs good to be prepared. To be prepared in an age where Mozilla is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/advertising/" target="_blank">suddenly an ad agency</a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-copilot-recall-cybersecurity-disaster" target="_blank">developing spyware</a>, OpenAI is asking governments for enough <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank">electrical power</a> to destroy the entire planet, and Apple is <a href="https://applescoop.org/story/shocking-apple-vision-pro-2-reportedly-cancelled" target="_blank">releasing products</a> people <em>don‚Äôt want</em>.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre living in a universe that is slowly becoming a perpetual backwards day (not that Microsoft was ever a decent forward-thinking company, or that OpenAI ever had any good intentions with their grift of theft, but I digress‚Ä¶).</p>

<p>But there are those who read my musings, who know I‚Äôm a freak for the fediverse.</p>

<p>You might guess where this is going.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWait, are you about to tell me that there‚Äôs a motherfuggin‚Äô Bandcamp, ON THE FEDIVERSE?‚Äù</p>

<p>Yes, yes I am about to tell you that, Fortnite Gamer.</p>

<p>This morning, while I was slogging away at getting ready for work, I saw a post flash past my Mastodon feed, something like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Bandcamp, but on the fediverse!‚Äù</p>

<p>I thought to myself, ‚ÄúHmm, okay. I‚Äôll bookmark this for 10 hours from now.‚Äù</p>
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="img-wrap">
<img src="/img/posts/bandwagon/tenhours.png" />
</div>
</div>
<p>So, I clicked the link and followed through to <a href="https://bandwagon.fm" target="_blank">Bandwagon.fm</a>, and, my dudes ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I now have a ‚Äúbandcamp‚Äù on the fediverse, <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/@cmdr_nova" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

<p>Save for the ability to actually <em>sell</em> your music (which I assume they‚Äôre working on?), you can upload whole entire albums here, and then people can stumble in and listen to what you‚Äôve made! That‚Äôs WILD. ‚Ä¶ on the FEDIVERSE?!</p>

<p>What I did here with my page, though, is I took the 3 most recent albums I did under Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and re-published them under my new name, PLEXX. Once I <em>finally</em> finish <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">disc eRROR 19‚Äã.‚Äã92 ~DE‚Äã-‚ÄãLUX</a>, I‚Äôll be putting that album there, too.</p>

<p>But this is <em>so cool</em>, and it‚Äôs connected to Musicbrainz, another open-source music cataloguing project!</p>

<p>Earlier today, I was having second thoughts about Linux, and sticking to open source and all that. Mostly because, I sort of miss a few programs that I‚Äôm having trouble getting working on Pop!_OS. But this kind of turned me around a bit. There‚Äôs <em>no</em> reason to go back to the bastardized version of whatever Bill Gates had in mind 30 years ago. This proves to me that regular people <em>will</em> restore the internet to what it should have always been.</p>

<p>The only thing it takes, is <em>patience</em>, and a whole lot less second-guessing myself and my decisions. And also maybe I need to sit in front of my computer screen a little less here and there. My eyes hurt.</p>

<p>Anyway, I <em>can‚Äôt wait</em> to see what the heck comes next, holy crap.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‚Äôm sure there are those who know that Bandcamp was recently bought out by a company called Songtradr, and this came with much dismay, because Bandcamp has been, and has mostly remained, one of the only music platforms where small artists could actually be discovered, heard, and paid.

<p>Enter: the_daily_report</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/the_daily_report/tree/main" target="_blank">simple python script</a> that you need only make a personal Reddit app for, and then you‚Äôre done (mostly).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still a bit of a noob, learning all of this stuff as I go, like you do, and <em>how I do</em>. So, I‚Äôm writing this with it scheduled to send me my daily report at 9am, everyday, and guess what, it works!</p>

<p>Voila:</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/thereport/the_report_example.png" /></p>

<p>I initially had to do a ton of troubleshooting, because my machine <em>doesn‚Äôt</em> just automatically send e-mails when I tell it to, and I‚Äôve detailed as much of that as I could in a troubleshooting section via the repository. Hopefully it‚Äôs clear enough what needs to be done.</p>

<p>I have this issue where, I‚Äôll use someone‚Äôs app, and then their help files make no sense, or are woefully incomplete. In writing my own, I now see why that may happen, because I‚Äôm basically just throwing in solutions I used and hoping they stick!</p>

<p>Now, <em>obviously</em>, this means you have to have your PC turned on at all times, unless of course you setup a server on a remote PC, such as renting a VPS over at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. I‚Äôve <em>considered</em> this for myself, but I don‚Äôt know if sending myself a daily report of trending posts in subreddits is really something I should just dump money into. Mostly, because I <em>do</em> have my PC on at all times, in-between minutes every couple of days that I restart the thing.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs an option!</p>

<p>Anyway, you can see the whole thing in the link above, and hopefully, if I‚Äôve done my job correctly, you can get it running for yourself.</p>

<p>Note: I do not use Windows, and I cannot tell you how to make this work on a Microsoft machine!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you‚Äôre like me, and you just can‚Äôt find it in yourself to quit the nerd-site, then maybe you should make it easier on yourself, and setup something to just give you a daily report (e-mail) on your favorite subreddits‚Äô top five trending posts.]]></summary></entry></feed>
