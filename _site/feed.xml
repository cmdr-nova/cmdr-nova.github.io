No, I’m not talking about Daikatana. That game is pretty cool, and I’m pretty sure it’s also very well known. I’m talking about Julie and Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2, a game that came, then said, “Hey!” and subsequently vanished into the ether of game development … seemingly, <em>forever</em>.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/heavy-metal/fakk2.png" /></p>

<p>A game built on the Quake 3 engine, based on / a sequel to Heavy Metal 2000 (a movie, release July 10, 2000), and developed by the now defunct and erased Ritual Entertainment (see: SiN, SiN: Emergence).</p>

<p>If you asked me, “Nova, why do you think this game failed?” I don’t think I’d be able to answer! It’s a fantasy style boobs, guns, and swords sorta game (you know how the late 90s and 2000s were in regard to gaming) that was trying to be Ritual’s version of Tomb Raider. I emphasize the boobs part, because, as you got damaged in the game, <em>so did Julie’s outfit.</em></p>

<p>The synopsis was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F.A.K.K. 2 stands for “Federation-Assigned Ketogenic Killzone to the second level”, and is the alias both of the heroine, Julie, and also her homeworld. Before the game begins, we are told that Julie has previously killed a tyrant and “would-be God” named Lord Tyler (during the events of Heavy Metal 2000), and brought the remnant of her people to a planet called Eden. The people of Eden have made a startling discovery: the waters of the planet grant an eternal life to those who drink it, and they have restored ti-rural paradise, pasturing ‘creepers’ (large bull-like creatures) and peacefully going about their business.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This planet is camouflaged by a F.A.K.K. 2 beacon and made to look like a biohazard-strewn wasteland in the hope that it will remain hidden from any threat. However, a creature named Gith, who appears only as a disembodied cybernetic head, runs a hyper-corporation called GITH Industries whose “employees” are little more than slaves. He scavenges the universe in a ship composed of three-quarters of a planet, and is headed for a place called Na’ChThraThull, or the “place of the soft machines”, which turns out to be Eden.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julie resides in the town of Eden with her sister Kerrie, who is pregnant. She interacts with various citizens, including her brother-in-law, Germain St. Germain. Peace is suddenly disturbed by the appearance of hostile insect-like creatures called Vymishes. Julie springs into combat, killing many of the creatures and saving a pregnant creeper in the process. She also kills a Vymish Mama, a queen-like Vymish. Afterward, Julie heads into town and meets Otto, the town’s gunsmith, who she gives a glowing green asteroid to for examination. Another asteroid knocks out the shield, and Julie, accompanied by Jared and Eon, is tasked with resetting the shield generator. Underground, Julie’s accomplices are killed by creatures called Grawlix, and she is forced to continue alone. She eventually resets the shield generator, but is too late to discover that GITH has arrived, and he teleports troops in to destroy the generator.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julie returns to town to find it under siege by GITH’s forces. Many citizens are dead, while others are hypnotized. Julie finds Otto, who has recovered a mysterious object from the asteroid. It turns out to be a message for Julie from the “Belphigoreans”, warning her that Gith is seeking the “Heart of the We”. Otto tells Julie about the Heart of the We, and tasks her with finding a native of Eden named Gruff. Julie leaves the besieged Eden, then journeys through the Mooagly swamps to find Gruff, who unlocks the path to the Temple of the We for her. She then overcomes the four challenges of the We before entering the final temple where the Heart of the We is kept. However, GITH is waiting for her, and he steals the Heart and uses it to bring Lord Tyler back to life, so he could have his revenge on Julie. However, Julie fights and kills Lord Tyler and wins the Heart, banishing GITH. She returns to town only to find out that her pregnant sister is kidnapped by GITH, who returns in a giant space station.</p>

<p>I <em>may</em> have beaten this game, I actually don’t even remember. What I <em>do</em> remember, is my parent’s Pentium Gateway <em>wasn’t</em> powerful enough to play it at 60 FPS. In fact, I think I had <em>a lot</em> of issues <em>just</em> playing it. Which boggled my mind, because the PC ran Quake 3 very easily, and pretty well.</p>

<p>Hey, maybe that’s why the game isn’t really remembered all too well. But, it could also be because Ritual Entertainment sold themselves to a mobile game studio and then vanished, never to be heard from again.</p>

<p>But when it <em>did</em> work, it was a cool game. Running, gunning, slicing, platforming, and wild cinematics. Back in the day, I was a pretty big fan of the Heavy Metal magazine, and all the art that came with it. I think I remember watching Heavy Metal 2000, and trying to figure out how it fit into the timeline of the game … only to realize I glossed over the part where they say the game’s like, 30 years after 2000. It <em>kind</em> of makes me want to try and get it running on a modern Windows system, just to play through it one more time, so that I can clearly remember everything. And I say “Windows system,” because <em>I already tried</em> using Wine and Proton to make this game work on Linux, and it <em>refused</em>.</p>

<p>But this is just a long line of games from Ritual that are lost to history, and nearly lost-media. Just like SiN, and Emergence. I think the two latter games are more known and memorable, and some may even still be waiting for their continuation, but if you’re interested in preserving history, and gaming history, like me, you’d probably like to know this game existed at some point, and it <em>should</em> be resurrected. If only to have a spot on the internet archive.</p>

<p>Oh! It <em>does</em> have <a href="https://archive.org/details/fakk2-pc-redump" target="_blank">a spot</a> there!</p>

<p><em>As of writing this, the internet archive is currently down due to a low-life who hacked and took the system down, but should be recovered at some point in the near future, so that my link to the FAKK 2 archive works.</em></p>

<p>I write about this, though, partially, because I still miss the era of mid-90s and 2000s era gaming <em>very much</em>. Not for the porn-y aspects of gaming that were all over the place back then, but just because games were released <em>faster</em>, and there were so many different concepts, things people and studios were willing to try … until the never-ending profit machine of our modern society decided to generic-ise everything.</p>

<p>Anyway, what the FAKK?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I’m on this kick of looking back over the years at old games that are still mega-popular, I also want to look at games that maybe nobody remembers, or even knows about.

<p>Now, the download <em>will only</em> download up to a maximum of 720p resolution videos. I did this, because 1080p can get a little chunk in your HDD, and I didn’t feel like making the app more complicated (such as by having to create a resolution selector). This is just, a real simple, give me the URL, and now you can watch a Youtube video without any ads whatsoever.</p>

<p>And! If you wanna support the YouTuber who uploaded it, you can still go right to their channel and hit that subscribble button.</p>

According to the Neocities subreddit, the person <em>behind</em> Neocities had written, a year ago, some <a href="https://kyledrake.com/writings/ai" target="_blank">positive thinking</a> about AI (which, I’m not sure can be fully judged a year later, since it’s only gotten extremely bad, <em>this year</em>). In response, some users were suggesting Nekoweb as an alternative for people who don’t want to be potentially affiliated with someone who endorses Sam Altman. And then I stumbled into an issue, and the <em>strangest</em> people I’ve met this week (so far).</p>

<p>Nekoweb is much like Neocities, and even more-so, it offers services that Neocities <em>doesn’t</em>. At first glance, this seems pretty awesome. You have more storage space, more bandwith, access to Git, FTP, and it’s even got framework for deploying your site with a static generator (like Jekyll). “Sweet.” I thought, this could really make my life easier, instead of pushing through Github, to Neocities, right?</p>

<p>There’s just <em>one problem.</em></p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/nekoweb/no-vpn.png" /></p>

<p>Nekoweb requires you reveal all personal information to them, in order to register an account. VPNs are <em>not allowed</em>.</p>

<p>The only other place online, thus far, that I’ve had any issue with using my VPN, be it via Proton’s subscription service that I use for e-mail, or Apple’s built-in VPN, has been Misskey’s flagship server (that auto-blocks Western users from registering). Not even <em>Activision</em> blocks you from using a VPN while playing their highly competitive shooters, Call of Duty.</p>

<p>So, like ya do, I joined their Discord, curious, a little bummed. Thinking, there’s <em>no way</em> I have to turn off something completely related to my <em>own</em> online safety and privacy just to make an account here, right?</p>

<p><em>Wrong.</em></p>

<p>I don’t feel the need to post direct screenshots, since this website is seen by quite a few more people than my Mastodon account, so I’ll just quote the person who immediately replied to me when I asked, “So why can’t I have my VPN turned on when I’m making an account?”</p>

<p>User / Supporter / or maybe even dev? responds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why are you using VPN to register an account?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>we had spammers use VPN to comment hate stuff on users guestbooks</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>probably why [team member affiliated with Nekoweb] doesn’t allow vpn</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Nekoweb team member responds,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>abuse prevention</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flabbergasted, blown-away, I respond, “I use a VPN provided by Proton’s subscription service that comes along with their e-mail, entirely just for privacy lol”</p>

<p>To which the first user replies, again,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>well in order to register you need proper internet connection and no VPN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<p><strong>PROPER INTERNET CONNECTION???</strong></p>

<p>It was at this point I kind of fell off and spiraled a bit, implied neither of them know what they’re doing, and left.</p>

<p>So, no, I absolutely wouldn’t recommend you use Nekoweb as an alternative to Neocities, if that’s what you’re looking for. How people who <em>don’t even know</em> what a VPN does, or is used for by average people, ended up <em>making an entire</em> web service, is wild, ridiculous, and makes absolutely no sense. And I get the impression that they <em>don’t want</em> new users, or any subscription money for that matter. Which is fine. They aren’t getting any from me.</p>

<p>For anyone else, who might be a little more rationally inclined, why use a VPN?</p>

<p>It’s not just for watching shows on Netflix you can’t get in the US. Some countries are blocked from most internet access and can’t interact with the outside world, <em>without</em> a VPN. Guess they aren’t allowed to make websites, either?</p>

<p>Why do <em>I</em> use a VPN? I use one, because I don’t think every website and provider needs my personal information at all times, every single time I access a domain. I especially don’t think the developers behind Nekoweb need my personal information, <em>just to make an account</em> on their Neocities clone. Entitled to my data as they may be, if you have a problem with spam and abuse coming from users behind VPNs, and you just ban VPN use, uhm, guys? You <em>know</em> that perpetrators of abuse can just make a new e-mail and do exactly the same thing, without a VPN? They could drive down the street to McDonalds, log on, and continue harassing your users.</p>

<p>And, I’m sorry, I’m still reeling over “proper internet connection.”</p>

<p>I’m just out of words in my brain sauce that would allow me to express how <em>ridiculous</em> that sounds … you guys made this web service? For real? You made a whole web service for hosting websites and you don’t even know the <em>first thing</em> about privacy and safety online?</p>

You <em>might</em> think that Doom’s original lore is probably really simple, some kind of, scratches on a paper looking concept, and while it certainly began that way–It also spawned a book. But, one of the reasons I want to visit the lore of the original Dooms, is because the newer Dooms seem … unclear to me, as to where exactly they are in the timeline. Or, if there even <em>is</em> a timeline. Anyway, let’s dive a little deeper into the 1993 classic, DOOM.</p>

<center><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/doom/doom.png" /></center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>So, basically, all this time, I’ve been extremely confused about whether or not you’re the same guy in <em>every Doom game ever made</em>. The short answer is: Yes, you are.</p>

<p>But, I feel like I can’t talk about the lore of all of Doom, without quoting the original opening fiction that started it all (quoted from the fandom wiki).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In DOOM, you’re a space marine, one of Earth’s toughest, hardened in combat and trained for action. Three years ago you assaulted a superior officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians. He and his body cast were shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home of the Union Aerospace Corporation. The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos. With no action for fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin’ dust and watchin’ restricted flicks in the rec room.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the last four years the military, UAC’s biggest supplier, has used the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various secret projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel. So far they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos, throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other. Recently however, the gateways have grown dangerously unstable. Military “volunteers” entering them have either disappeared or been stricken with a strange form of insanity–babbling vulgarities, bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering an untimely death of full-body explosion. Matching heads with torsos to send home to the folks became a full-time job. Latest military reports state that the research is suffering a small setback, but everything is under control.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos. “We require immediate military support. Something fraggin’ evil is coming out of the gateways! Computer systems have gone berserk!” The rest was incoherent. Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky. Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been unsuccessful.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles were sent up pronto to Phobos. You were ordered to secure the perimeter of the base while the rest of the team went inside. For several hours, your radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders, screams, bones cracking, then finally silence. Seems your buddies are dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Things aren’t looking too good. You’ll never navigate off the planet on your own. Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by the assault team leaving you only with a pistol. If only you could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in the forehead. Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As you walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls echoing throughout the distant corridors. They know you’re here. There’s no turning back now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking, “This game came <em>before</em> Quake, and it already has a much more fleshed out story?” Yeah, kinda weird, right? It continues on like this, into a book, onto Earth, as the invasion of Hell continues, into Doom 64 where you <em>return</em> to Hell, then to Doom 2016 where you’re … entombed, and then awoken in an alternate reality, and it just keeps going.</p>

<p>I remember when I was a kid, I was only partially aware of all this lore. In fact, I think the <em>only</em> thing I paid attention to was the Doom guy holding his rabbit’s severed head at the end of the game. Oh, and the nightmares I had where, in the middle of the night, I actually hallucinated Lost Souls flying in and out of my room, and it was <em>terrifying</em> at the time (I think I was forced to take a break from the game at this point).</p>

<p>But did you know Doom guy had a family? And that family was <em>murdered</em> by Demons? Did you know there was a theatrical recreation of Doom that starts off with transphobia, and then explains away the demons completely by being like, “Oh, no it’s not demons. It’s humans infected with another chromosome.” I didn’t like that movie much, aside from the strange inclusion of the game-dev’s names, as characters, <em>in the movie</em>.</p>

<p>Did you know that, according to the official Doom <em>book</em>, the Doom marine’s name is Corporal Flynn Taggart? I’m not sure this is ever held up as canon <em>anywhere</em> else, but it’s a neat little tidbit. The book itself had two nebula nominees, and here’s the synopsis for you …</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Gates were there on Phobos when mankind first arrived. Inert, unyielding, impossibly alien constructs, for twenty years they sat lifeless, mute testaments to their long-vanished creators, their secrets hidden. Then one day, they sprang to life . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meet Corporal Flynn Taggart, United States Marine Corps; serial number 888-23-9912. He’s the best warrior the twenty-first century has to offer, which is a damn good thing. Because Flynn Taggart is all that’s standing between the hell that just dropped in on Mars and an unsuspecting planet Earth . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m more quoting, and reflecting on all of this, because, I’m just now really discovering just <em>how much</em> lore there actually is behind Doom, and finding that it really doesn’t need a whole lot of discussion and deep dives. But, I do think I want to finally <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knee-Deep-Dead-Doom-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00AK804G2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TT58OFRGFPXO&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fDVPBGj8GSwKTLST0HjuWj1_OB3f3f6ldm6ByBR6v4icAFYf6TCycjAc0mMZC4q-L6VQpmQR1I_CDWJdp5h59kYjsnIbqH1dWdCFyVJYjodqgNUAreHnJFsJRNbeMx0DB14OlDPzOIDpYzMJtXWH9K4lVnNpbiRJPRQUiJDfpD3DBnk3NyzSDggC0kQMT4G32ZuyXledSfzbDzu_GmxL7Ge_P4ZwUqMITzLXFAyJuHc.QtP3uvPIL5jOTvZFEKB40R8anAcB5CAtP22mmK5vSCo&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=doom+book&amp;qid=1728956960&amp;sprefix=doom+boo%2Caps%2C133&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">read that book</a>.</p>

<p>Never-the-less, this is kind of where my obsession with gaming <em>really</em> started. Sure, there was Wolfenstein 3D, Blake Stone, Commander Keen, Ja … Jazz JackRabbit? But then there was DOOM. And then fond memories watching my Dad play Quake FTP multiplayer against one of his friends, and then me being <em>absolutely badass</em> in Quake 2 multiplayer … and then finding I SUCKED HARD in Quake 3 multiplayer (because they completely changed the way the game felt, controlled, and aimed).</p>

<p>My entire childhood was me, waiting for school to be over, so that I could dive back into <em>one of these games</em>. And, despite my delve into coding at the age of 39, I find it strange I never just, you know, <em>started making my own games</em>. At least, until I started making this Mafia Wars clone, that I absolutely <em>am not</em> going to continue, because I don’t think I have the correct know-how to securely store people’s usernames and passwords on an encrypted database, on a server that can’t <em>easily be hacked</em>. But … maybe there is room for something <em>else.</em></p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/doom/mafia_wars.png" /></p>

<p>(Yes, this is an actual semi-functional clone of Mafia Wars, that can only be played by me, on my HDD, and <s>I will never release it to the public lol</s> Nevermind, <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/Mafia-Hustle" target="_blank">here it is</a>.)</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I wrote about Quake and, by extension, Quake 2’s lore.

Anyway, let’s dive a little deeper into the 1993 classic, DOOM.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">28 Years Later, Let’s Look At Quake’s Lore</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gaming/2024/10/13/28-years-later-let-s-look-at-quake-s-lore.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="28 Years Later, Let’s Look At Quake’s Lore" /><published>2024-10-13T16:08:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-13T16:08:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gaming/2024/10/13/28-years-later-let-s-look-at-quake-s-lore</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gaming/2024/10/13/28-years-later-let-s-look-at-quake-s-lore.html"><![CDATA[<p>So, today, I was playing Quake 1 and 2, and something ocurred to me, that hadn’t ever ocurred to me in the 28 to 30 years that these games have been a thing: I’ve never fully understood <em>what in the hell</em> the story is supposed to <em>be</em>. Obviously, we’re going to skip Quake 3, not because it isn’t good (it’s one of the greatest arena shooters of all time), but because its story is more that of Unreal Tournament. In that, it’s just people from different dimensions fighting in nonstop deathmatch.</p>

<p>But … if you’ve ever seen those memes online where people poke fun at games where they’re like, “Hey, who’s John Darksouls?” and someone’s like, “He’s the main character of Dark Souls, cousin of John Halo.” … You’re going to love the story behind Quake 1.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/quake/quake.png" /></p>

<p>The background, according <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_Story#The_Story" target="_blank">to the Wiki</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You get the phone call at 4 a.m. By 5:30 you’re in the secret installation. The commander explains tersely, “It’s about the Slipgate device. Once we perfect these, we’ll be able to use them to transport people and cargo from one place to another instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An enemy codenamed Quake, [sic] is using his own slipgates to insert death squads inside our bases to kill, steal, and kidnap.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The hell of it is we have no idea where he’s from. Our top scientists think Quake’s not from Earth, but another dimension. They say Quake’s preparing to unleash his real army, whatever that is.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You’re our best man. This is Operation Counterstrike and you’re in charge. Find Quake, and stop him … or it … You have full authority to requisition anything you need. If the eggheads are right, all our lives are expendable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that’s not all!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While scouting the neighborhood, you hear shots back at the base. Damn, that Quake bastard works fast! He heard about Operation Counterstrike, and hit first. Racing back, you see the place is overrun. You are almost certainly the only survivor. Operation Counterstrike is over. Except for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know that the heart of the installation holds a slipgate. Since Quake’s killers came through, it is still set to his dimension. You can use it to get loose in his hometown. Maybe you can get to the asshole personally. You pump a round into your shotgun, and get moving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s it! I mean, obviously, it continues a bit into the actual game, where you’re traversing different dimensions and collecting runes … killing enemies like something out of Lovecraft, but in its most basic sense, and I mean no offense to those who worked or work for ID Software and on this game, but if I didn’t know what Quake was, I would assume this was a sixth grader’s creative writing homework. I mean, it just starts talking at you, as if you <em>already</em> know what’s going on? It starts out in 2nd-person perspective and never leaves that narrative. And then there’s “Operation Counterstrike,” which makes me wonder where the original devs behind CounterStrike got their game’s name from.</p>

<p>Especially because Team Fortress was <em>originally</em> a Quake multiplayer mod made by the community (in the 90s).</p>

<p>I wanted to read through all of this, because I <em>also</em> didn’t understand the connection between <em>this game</em>, and the second game, where we’re suddenly invading the Strogg’s home planet, and there’s me thinking, “Who the heck are the Strogg, again?”</p>

<p>The short answer to that question, is: The Strogg and Quake 2 have almost <em>nothing</em> to do with Quake 1. It’s a restart, and I kind of found that a little disappointing. The <em>theme</em> of Quake 1 is really cool, and it feels a bit more linked to Doom in the way it handles its world … even if the lore <em>really</em> leaves something to be desired.</p>

<p>Quake 2’s basic lore (via this <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/Quake_II#The_Story" target="_blank">Wiki</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quake II takes place in a futuristic sci-fi environment. During the single player campaign, you take the role of a Marine called Bitterman, taking part in “Operation Alien Overlord”, attempting to save Earth from the Strogg invasion by counter-attacking their planet, Stroggos. During the first attack on Stroggos, the Big Gun strikes down most of the Marine pods with a powerful EMP blast. This causes most of the pods to crash land (many miles from their target landing zones). Most of the Marines are captured or killed, but Bitterman is one of the lucky few to survive. He finds himself many miles from the Big Gun in a Strogg base on the outskirts of the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>almost</em> sounds like they retconned the enemy’s name to be Strogg, (pronounced stroeg), rather than John Quake, the main antagonist of planet Quake, from Quake.</p>

<p>And I guess, if you think of it in that way, it makes a <em>little</em> more sense. The Strogg invasion of Earth … could be considered parallel to “Quake’s” invasion of a military base, and therefore … Earth. Maybe. But, I’m just kind of inserting my own canon into something that’s been over and done with for <em>decades</em>.</p>

<p>The subsequent games all follow strings of lore from Quake 2 (mostly), and I think only Quake 3 acknowledges Quake 1. Which, <em>again</em>, is a shame. I definitely feel like ID should come back for another full Quake release, and give us some continuity here. Even if it only matters to like … five people.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, today, I was playing Quake 1 and 2, and something ocurred to me, that hadn’t ever ocurred to me in the 28 to 30 years that these games have been a thing: I’ve never fully understood what in the hell the story is supposed to be.

<p>If I wasn’t feeling so much like a dumpster full of garbage, I would have made the progress a little more coherent, but I have an idea for a chorus type melody that I want to put on that little break in-between the main section.

<p>Which, I’ll do when I don’t feel like I’m <em>literally dying</em>.</p>

Do you miss that? Oh, yeah, me either. But, the old part of Twitter I’m actually talking about here, are the bots that people used to setup, that read from their tweets, and then shot out a randomized post. I think some of them were called like, “John Reads” or “John Books”, wherein they’d put their name and qualify it with something related to writing or reading. Either way, remember that? Do ya?</p>

<p>Well, I recreated that in a bot, that reads from a spreadsheet of your posts, jumbles it, randomizes it, restructures it, and then posts them semi-logically, to <em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/post_gen_bot" target="_blank">post_gen_bot on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, in my use-case for this, I have it reading from Google Sheets I’ve generated as backups of every single post I’ve made to Mastodon since the beginning of 2024, because … I just didn’t know what to do with all of that, <em>until now</em>. But, I’m assuming, if you really wanted to, you could feed your old backed-up tweets from a deleted Twitter account, <em>into this bot</em>, and then have it post jumbled nonsense from your posting-past on social media.</p>

<p>That’d be kinda neat, right?</p>

<p>Now, this is like the 4th or 5th bot I’ve made? I don’t know, I’m losing count already.</p>

<p>But, I <em>have</em> had a little bit of aggression directed toward me via the fediverse. Because, some people just don’t think. They don’t consider what they’re doing, or read what they’re targeting. They don’t particularly <em>care</em> if you’ve spent time making something interesting, or neat, and would simply request that you mute, delete, and ban your work.</p>

<p>To those people, I say, lighten the frikk up. Don’t waste your reports, just use the <em>mute</em> function. I don’t make these things to please other people, or to meet your expectations or specific specifications of what <em>you personally</em> believe the fediverse should be. I do this <em>for me</em>. And if you don’t like that, <em>you don’t have to see it.</em></p>

<p>It reminds me of years back, on another Mastodon account, where I was posting about Tomb Raider and how cool the iteration of the game I was playing, happened to be, and this … I don’t want to call them “extremely online,” because there was something <em>else</em> wrong with them, entirely, but this person came into my notifications, and they were like, “I don’t care about Tomb Raider, why are you talking about this?”</p>

<p>And I was taken aback, like … There are legitimately people out there who fully and completely believe the entire world, and everyone in it, revolves around <em>them</em>, specifically. And that’s frikken <em>nuts</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is a problem that only exists on Mastodon, though. I think this is wide-spread, across all of social media, and the internet, and it’s only been exasperated by a society that celebrates individualism and isolation, and so on, and so forth. I could go on for hours, but this is a topic for another time.</p>

<p>Either way, for those that like bots, here’s another one for you.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember on Twitter, back in the golden days, when the worst part of the website were the people who were addicted to finding things they thought were bad about other people, and then creating dunk posts, and dogpiles?

I started screwing around with Python after spending time casually reading about it, and decided to learn it, hands-on, and I smashed up a slew of interesting things. Then, I started thinking about, despite my love for Linux, and especially Debian, there are some critical things I still don’t have access to while <em>on</em> Linux.</p>

<p>Such as things I use for my creations in Second Life, like Quixel, Marvelous Designer. And how I’m basically <em>locked</em> to only using Gimp. And, regrettably, there <em>are</em> a few games I want to play that I just can’t. With these things in mind, I decided to mess around and put Windows on my System76 machine. It wasn’t all <em>that</em> painful, because I have all of my important stuff backed up on the cloud, and I don’t mind redownloading games as I decide I’m interested in playing them.</p>

<p>But … And this could end up being the reason I decide to just put Linux back onto my PC: Turning Windows into a machine for a developer is a <em>pain in the ass</em>.</p>

<p>From configuring SSH, to realizing I didn’t have OpenSSH, to installing OpenSSH, to configuring PowerShell, to downloading the actual latest version, to screwing with SSH keys, to adding, deleting, adding, deleting, adding, deleting, and adding and deleting about 15 different keys, before I generated a new one, and then <em>manually pasted the key</em> into the authorizations <em>on my Debian server</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, but then there’s VS Code … An apparent Microsoft centric developer app, that crashes against a wall as soon as you try to push and sync? Because apparently, or at least in my case, it doesn’t know to <em>use OpenSSH</em>?!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here I am, with access to all of my games, and every single program I used to use, and <em>also</em> my developer tools setup exactly the same way they were in Pop!_OS.</p>

<p>I do have to say that I really like Pop!_OS, but I’m <em>not</em> that excited about merging and migrating my entire system to the Rust based COSMIC. I don’t know. I … kind of like Ubuntu, you know?</p>

<p>All that aside, we’ll see how long this lasts. Despite the shortcomings, Linux is really a revolutionary OS, and I’ll probably put it all back sometime in the future. Probably when I get tired of the games I wanted to play, and decide to figure out the workarounds for the apps I want to use in Windows (I don’t like using Virtual Machines, I just want to interact with my actual PC).</p>

<p>But, until then, I’m going to see how far I can stretch Windows into giving me control of the system.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, it’s been an interesting week and a half.

<p>As it turns out, small-time bots are a little bit easier. The way that I accomplished this, was by making a <em>secondary</em> bot, that uses the same Mastodon access codes, and runs every 13 minutes, outside of the 10 minute window that the Reddit bot uses (simulating what a normal person might post like … if they were a bot).</p>

<p>You can see the Chatter-Bot <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/chatter-bot" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I’m aware that all these little worker-bots I’ve built have all been built before, albeit, probably in different ways, and with different code. But these all <em>also</em> work, and they do specific things that I’m sure the others probably don’t.</p>

<p>I updated the Reddit-Post bot to include Reddit usernames and the subreddit that they came from (so that it’s more clear), and I made it so the bot will periodically look for followers, and follow new follows plus unfollow defollows (emulating a real influencer!).</p>

<p>As far as the Chatter-Bot goes, it also has embedded replies that it’ll shoot at you if you send it a mention. This is structured much the same way the status posts are, except they’re only used when someone goes, “Hey @net_run@mkultra.monster, what the hell are you on about?”</p>

<p>Now … in regards to my “Mafia Hustle” Mafia Wars clone, uh. Yeah, I’m just gonna set that aside for now! Might return to it at a later date.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, it’s my day off, you know.

<p>Have you ever thought to yourself, “Man, why do I have to copy/paste blog post links and then also post them? I have more important things to do, like jorkin it in the club, you know, with my peanuts.”</p>

<p>Well, friend, you are in luck today.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/blog-poster" target="_blank">Blog-Poster</a>. He’ll dig into your RSS feed, post whatever’s new straight to Mastodon, and then archive it in a permanent ignore list, just so he’s sure never to mistake something that’s old, for something new.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Of course, you can give him a new name, like “Barry” or “Fart Face.” It doesn’t matter to me!</p>

<p>I still have lots to learn, and I’m starting to retain more and more as I do this, but I realize that programming is a very large and long road. Heck. I’ve been screwing with HTML since about 1999, and I still have to keep Google open to reference CSS modules and what-not. Plus, I’m getting older, and stuff just slips out of my brain juice and then it’s gone with the wind.</p>

<p>Either way, that’s all I have to write about for now, cause tomorrow’s my day off from my offline job, and I’m about to chill, and do nothing. Or make a 4th bot. I dunno yet.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the dunces in the room are using AI to paint pictures for them, and make one-bar songs, I’m making little worker bee-bots that aren’t AI at all, but act more like little tiny butlers for me.
