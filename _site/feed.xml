But, also, it‚Äôs a topic that‚Äôs scattered all over the Fediverse in about a million threads with no clear beginning, or even an end. To cut straight to the matter: Another Mastodon instance where some dudes knock on and on about being ‚Äúneutral‚Äù politically so as to not cause upsets, and to create a ‚Äúwelcoming‚Äù environment for everyone, have probably killed their instance.</p>

<p>It all started days ago, when it was discovered that one of the moderators behind Fosstodon was <em>also</em> moderating a subreddit, where he expressed numerous anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-immigration views. People were <em>quick</em> to jump and call him fascist, <strong>and they were correct to do so.</strong></p>

<p>But it didn‚Äôt stop there.</p>

<p>I had to go searching Mastodon for a little bit so that I could make a list of less than five major things I feel should shine the clearest light on all of this behavior. There‚Äôs <em>a lot</em> to it, but I honestly don‚Äôt feel like you need a dissertation of a couple hundred posts to get the gist of what happened. So, let‚Äôs get started.</p>

<p>First, the Fosstodon/Reddit moderator in-question here, was a user named ‚ÄúCarrotcypher,‚Äù and, since having the lid flipped on who he is as a person, went through and scrubbed his username from posts he made on Reddit, and has since stepped down and <em>entirely deleted his Mastodon account</em>.</p>

<p>You can read a more concise account of these things, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lo__/114370692797365997" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>And, <em>just in case</em> the post goes missing, or something happens wherein it‚Äôs no longer accessible, here‚Äôs what it says:</p>

<blockquote>
One of the #Fosstodon moderators, Carrotcypher, has a history of hostility and intolerance towards minorities that does not align with Fosstodon's stated values.

Here is the moderator defending the #deportation of #MahmoudKhalil

</blockquote>

<p>But, how did the admins of Fosstodon respond to people‚Äôs absolutely <em>rightful</em> criticism of this, and their questions in regard to ‚Ä¶ <em>who recruited this guy</em>?</p>

<p>Well, first, there‚Äôs Mike, and I found a couple of posts that I think paint a pretty clear picture of how he feels about this, and what he‚Äôs willing to cover for:</p>

<p>Firstly, we have <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@mike/114394345053697948" target="_blank">this post</a>, where, at the end of a semi-long thread where Mike makes excuses about how he feels that since these bigoted decisions were made elsewhere, it has no tangible consequences to Fosstodon, or it‚Äôs admin and moderation team (which is categorically ridiculous to say, and think).</p>

<p>And, because I fully believe this will all cease to exist at some point, maybe even likely in the near future, here‚Äôs how he ended his thread of excuses:</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/fosstodon/mike1.png" /></p>

<p>I also want to include <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@mike/114399880044272760" target="_blank">this post</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/fosstodon/mike2.png" /></p>

<p>Where Mike argues that these are simply, you know, <em>conservative</em> views, not a problem. They just want to have a diverse team of people with all sorts of ideas so as to not create a bubble, or whatever fascist-apologists say in order to make it easier for evil people to exist.</p>

<p>This is all a symptom of a larger problem with men in the tech and foss community in-general, wherein they adopt the position of neutrality in order to foster what they believe to be a ‚Äúwelcoming‚Äù environment, which holds the door open for suit-wearing Nazis who want to exterminate marginalized people.</p>

<p>You can see an example of this problem in the <em>other</em> admin‚Äôs (Kev‚Äôs) blog post, <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice, the post says a whole lot of <em>nothing</em>. His post is mostly a lot of bla-bla-bla, ‚Äúpeople called us names,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù ‚ÄúFosstodon might close.‚Äù And then, after all of that, we get to the important part of his post:</p>

<blockquote>
The last point I'll make is this - the fedi is supposed to be a friendly, welcoming online space, right? But the fact is, it isn't. It's just like everywhere else online - the vocal minority are just as loud, and just as obnoxious as everywhere else.

I'd like to say it's been a fun 8 years, but it hasn't. I was fun for the first 3 years or so. After that, it's been pretty much shit, to varying degrees, the entire time. ‚úåüèª
</blockquote>

<p>In all the neutrality these people try to keep, these last two paragraphs show you the <em>real</em> feelings behind that false-face, and fake grin.</p>

<p>‚Äúthe fedi is supposed to be a friendly, welcoming online space, right? ‚Ä¶ the vocal minority are just as loud, and just as obnoxious as everywhere else.‚Äù</p>

<p>Really big red flag here. Huge red flag.</p>

<p>Remember, this <em>entire thing</em> happened because of a moderator <em>these people recruited</em>, who then expressed fascist views via other forms of communication. Kev, are you saying that the Fediverse should be <em>welcoming</em> to these types of people (don‚Äôt they already have a choke-hold over Twitter)? Is that what you wanted to get off your chest? Is that the ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù space you think you‚Äôre creating? A space where hateful men can silence and erase the voices of transgender people, and those who would speak up for immigrants who are being shuttled off to who the hell knows where?</p>

<p>Are the hundreds, or maybe even thousands of people criticizing you two, the vocal minority? I mean, it is just <em>you two guys</em> defending these decisions, against numerous instances who are now blocking you from federation, <em>entirely</em>. Is that how you would define a minority?</p>

<p>Is it, Kev?</p>

<p>But, this is the big problem. This is what keeps ‚Äúnormies‚Äù away from the Fediverse. It‚Äôs not the LGBTQ+ people, it‚Äôs not the immigrants trying to establish a voice for themselves online, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúpolitically neutral‚Äù tech-obsessed foss-bros who are so insulated from harm and hatred, that they can‚Äôt tell the difference between a guy who would ship you off to prison for being gay, and someone who thinks everyone should have equal rights.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll say it until I‚Äôm blue in the face, the Fediverse needs to excise people like this as hard as they have this past week, from ActivityPub, <em>entirely</em>. Over and over again. Until they return to Twitter, and we never have to look at their shitty little profile pictures, ever again.</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I was kind of debating writing this, because it‚Äôs not a very happy, or good topic.

But, these kinds of takes were inevitable, since corporate social media is already a thunder-dome of garbage, and <em>of course</em> there are people who want to see Mastodon and other extended ActivityPub apps mirror that. What I‚Äôm talking about, this time, though, is ‚Äúinfluencers.‚Äù</p>

<p>I wrote last year, somewhere along the line, about how the influencer mindset is a disease, and I <em>still</em> hold that position.</p>

<p>Algorithmic feeds have been <em>the worst thing</em> to happen to the social web, because, again and again, the only thing it does is center and reward people who <em>lie, cheat, and scam</em>. Wannabe ‚Äúinfluential‚Äù people who latch onto a trend, or a brand, and say intentionally disingenuous, or sometimes even <em>nasty</em> things, <em>just to get a reaction.</em> Because that‚Äôs what does numbers on algorithmic social media, and that is, in-turn, <em>how they get paid</em>.</p>

<p>ActivityPub and the Fediverse is rightfully attractive to many people. Something that‚Äôs hundreds to thousands of people hosting their own version of a piece of software, that anyone can use, so that none of the social network is governed by any single entity, therefore ensuring that the Twitter problem, essentially, <em>never happens</em>. That‚Äôs really cool, right?</p>

<p>So, it would make sense, that, in time, it would attract people who think like this:</p>

<blockquote>
"I like that there's no influencers/clout chasers/celebrities on the fediverse"

Ok, but you do realize you're saying you like that people can't make a living here, right? That what happens here can't affect the larger world. That the big closed networks will never be supplanted by this one. You get that, right? 

I mean, this is a communication tool. We're communicating with each other. It's such a small understanding of what that means if it's not to influence the world we live in. 

And, frankly, it's entitled to insist that everyone else should abide by that narrow sensibility.
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm not including who said this, because I‚Äôm trying to be a little nicer, and to also not look like I‚Äôm trying to target anyone. Partially because I‚Äôm now a moderator on a community instance, and it‚Äôs important that people don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm some kind of asshole who hates everything and is trying to take people down, but also because <em>I‚Äôm not trying to target anyone</em>.</p>

<p>But I <em>do</em> want to talk about this, regardless, because I feel like if people come to the Fediverse with these lines of thinking, and nobody goes, ‚ÄúHold up, let me tell you why we don‚Äôt want this here.‚Äù We may just end up with an instance or two full of people trying to exploit others for their own personal gain.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs honestly what an influencer is. Except, I think we need to look at individual points here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I don‚Äôt really know of any studies that have ever been done on influencers, but <em>I‚Äôm pretty sure</em> making any kind of a living doing it, is only something that‚Äôs afforded to those who are either <em>very lucky</em>, or <em>already rich</em>.</p>

<p>And, saying that ‚Ä¶ this is bad, because if you can‚Äôt make a living and get rich on, say, Mastodon, you‚Äôre not affecting the larger world? As if a platform is only important if it‚Äôs making someone who posts engagement bait rich, otherwise it‚Äôs, what? Trivial? Useless?</p>

<p>The big closed networks being the way that they are, <em>is the reason</em> ActivityPub exists. Apps like Mastodon weren‚Äôt developed as a replacement for Twitter. They were developed <em>as an alternative</em> for people who just want a <strong>social</strong> network. That‚Äôs a big thing here, because I feel like the social part of being online has been nearly dead for the past 20 years. And, if you want to get an idea of what I‚Äôm even talking about, you don‚Äôt even have to look at Twitter.</p>

<p>Go open Threads. Post a few times, mingle with the people.</p>

<p>Tell me what it looks like when your social network is nothing but influencers trying to get rich off of engagement.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve done that, I want you to tell me if you feel like Threads is useful, and not entirely pointless to regular people.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You‚Äôre right, disembodied voice of someone dissenting about the theme and point of ActivityPub, it is a <em>communication tool</em>. Communication is not something that influencers engage in.</p>

<p>And I can tell you right now, that ActivityPub and the Fediverse has very much influenced the world, <em>even if</em> grind-set, money-brained (or celebrities, if anyone actually cares about what celebrities think) people refuse to use it. You wouldn‚Äôt have posted this diatribe via Mastodon if the network hadn‚Äôt influenced you to be there. I know, you‚Äôre probably looking at this, and if you know me, you‚Äôre going, ‚ÄúHey, but don‚Äôt you sell digital albums and other things?‚Äù</p>

<p>Yeah, I do. But we‚Äôll get to that.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is mostly the end of this person‚Äôs rant, and there‚Äôs really not a whole lot to address here, aside from the fact that ‚Ä¶ this is a projection. Yes, <em>it is</em> entitled to insist that everyone should abide by your narrow sensibilities. Being as that, you are the only one complaining about this.</p>

<p>Speaking of ‚Äúmaking money‚Äù on the fediverse, though, I want to share something.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/influencer-problem/sales.png" /></p>

<p>These are my all-time sales from Bandcamp, over the course of the past 7 or 8 years. Now, obviously, if you‚Äôre a more popular artist, or regularly use algorithmic social media, maybe you‚Äôve made much more than me. That‚Äôs not what matters, here, though.</p>

<p>Where do you think a majority of these sales came from? Twitter?</p>

<p>Nah.</p>

<p>Although, these numbers, if you look at them over the span of 7-8 years, really aren‚Äôt that huge ‚Ä¶ but, it‚Äôs <em>still pretty huge</em> that I‚Äôve made around 4000 USD in sales, largely from just sharing and talking about my work on Mastodon.</p>

<p>Now, obviously, I‚Äôm not rich. Most of, if not all of this money has gone toward life expenses and bills, and absolutely none of that is still in any of my accounts.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs still pretty impressive, at least, if you‚Äôre someone who thinks it‚Äôs not possible to make money on the Fediverse.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs just it though. I‚Äôm not <em>on</em> the Fediverse to ‚Äúmake money.‚Äù Sure, I share my work and sometimes I make sales, but that‚Äôs not the reason I‚Äôm there. I don‚Äôt view social media and people who follow me as a potential transaction. I don‚Äôt view other people as numbers on a spreadsheet, with AI-brainstorming about how I can draw more engagement out of them.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt do <em>any of that shit</em>.</p>

<p>Treating every interaction as a transaction, or the potential for a monetary transaction, is <em>inherently</em> toxic, manipulative, and antithetical to a social web. If this upsets you, and you don‚Äôt want to be part of something like this ‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to be! You can go be on Threads, you can go be on Twitter, or, hey, you can go be on Bluesky! Where they‚Äôve just suddenly <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/bluesky-verification-blue-check-twitter-x" target="_blank">decided to start giving ‚Äúnotable‚Äù users an ego boost</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs up to you!</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the beauty, or <em>at least was</em>, the beauty of the internet, before it was overtaken by oligarchs and corporations. You could just ‚Ä¶ <em>do whatever you wanted</em>, and it didn‚Äôt have to be for any specific reason other than to meet people and chill. Which is (one of) the whole point of the internet!</p>

<p>Corporatizing ActivityPub would be the beginning of its downfall, and I‚Äôm glad that people who think everything should be corporate and influential to grind-set, mindset weirdos, <em>don‚Äôt like it.</em> Let‚Äôs keep it that way.</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="influencers" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I‚Äôm going to talk about something that someone decided to complain about, on the Fediverse, that most of us on the aforementioned verse are extremely opposed to.

A lot of that has to do with me filling my free time with building a ridiculous world around my base in Minecraft Java (heavily modded), and jumping back into World of Warcraft on my original DeathKnight from ‚Ä¶ uh, whatever year Wrath of the Lich King released. And that kind of has to do with why I want to write this today. Why I want to write about how Discord, the community chat app, has, and <em>is</em>, killing communities not only around the web, but also within games.</p>

<p>I think I‚Äôve written before about how Discord has almost completely killed usage of internet forums (which is partially why I decided to host <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster/" target="_blank">my own forum</a>, even if nobody feels like joining it), which is <em>terrible</em> for retention of data online. Especially if you‚Äôre someone who uses search engines to find answers to questions, none of the problem solving happening within Discord channels is searchable on Google, and is absolutely <em>not permanent</em>.</p>

<p>And now, that problem will be <em>especially</em> exasperated, as the <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-cuts-funding-for-internet-archive" target="_blank">government defunds grants related to the Internet Archive</a>, one of many horrible moves to erase, destroy, and replace history as we know it.</p>

<p>But ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm getting a little off-topic.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this today, because this is a problem I‚Äôve seen grow more and more over the years. It‚Äôs related to World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, or basically any online game where players are supposed to talk with each other <em>within those games</em>.</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs not happening, is it?</p>

<p>I log onto World of Warcraft and encounter players in-game. Nobody speaks. I do casual dungeons with random groups. The tank bursts through everything, not even paying even a single bit of attention to the other group members around them. And, once the final boss is beaten, the group disbands, all without anyone ever speaking a word. This was a little bit of an issue ten years ago, and it‚Äôs only gotten worse.</p>

<p>I also have personal experience with joining <em>guilds</em>, places that are supposed to be <em>communities</em>, where, instead of any of that, you‚Äôre immediately assaulted with Discord links.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to join our Discord!‚Äù</p>

<p>So, instead of people speaking in groups, in guild chat, or in the game <em>at all</em>, communication has moved to the modernized IRC and AOL Instant Messenger merger chat client.</p>

<p>Oh, ‚Ä¶ great.</p>

<p>So, instead of speaking to you and other members of a guild inside of the actual game, I have to tab out of the game and talk in your closed channels on a proprietary app that has already singlehandedly all but murdered old-net social media?</p>

<p>I even went on the World of Warcraft forums and responded to a thread where someone asks, ‚ÄúHow do you meet people in-game?‚Äù and I responded, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. I don‚Äôt.‚Äù And someone felt they needed to reply with, ‚ÄúJoin Discord servers!‚Äù</p>

<p>Look. I think Discord is alright for keeping up with friends and people I know, and there are some uses of servers, like the server I use to connect my Patreon and content I make or write, but also?</p>

<p><strong>Fuck Discord</strong>.</p>

<p>This is <em>also</em> a problem in Second Life, a virtual world that is <em>literally described</em> as a 3D chat application, where, now, <em>almost everyone is exclusively speaking in Discord channels instead of <strong>in</strong> Second Life!</em></p>

<p>How does this kill communities?</p>

<p>Instead of walking around within games and virtual worlds, and meeting people naturally, everyone‚Äôs ignoring each other until the off-chance they speak in Discord.</p>

<p>Do I have to detail how this is terrible for the health of communities?</p>

<p>Who wants to play a game filled with millions of people that is now essentially singleplayer until you join the app that‚Äôs harvesting all of your data?</p>

<p>But, I understand I‚Äôm mostly blowing hot air here. Me posting this won‚Äôt stop this from happening, and it‚Äôll probably only get worse and worse. That‚Äôs the way of the world nowadays, anyway.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs only a matter of time before our actual society mirrors some dystopian depiction of what society might be like if all the wrong things happen and nobody says or does anything.</p>

<p>And I‚Äôve been wondering: Am I just being old, yelling at clouds while new things take over?</p>

<p>20 years ago, old people were yelling about how smartphones wouldn‚Äôt improve anything, or in the 90s, about how the internet was a passing fad. But, I think both of these things improved society, even if, 20 years later, both smartphones and the internet are being turned into projections of evil via oligarchs and corporations. And, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really think this is about just ‚Äúbeing old,‚Äù and more, I think it‚Äôs just about people accepting shit, and consuming shit, because they don‚Äôt know any better.</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="discord" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve written on an actual topic.

Most of this has to do with mental burn-out and the current political climate. The rest of it has to do with me being <em>absolutely</em> addicted to Minecraft and the little world I‚Äôve built where I routinely solo-raid the Nether while continually building cobblestone fences around my house. But, I figured I‚Äôd write something here before I head off to work for the umpteenth time.</p>

<p>So, first things first, if you missed it, I am now a moderator over at <a href="https://labyrinth.zone">labyrinth.zone</a>, wherein I‚Äôll be working with other moderators handling reports. I threw my hat into the ring with this instance, because it is, quite frankly, one of my favorite places to post. Why not go deeper in that involvement? Hence, here we are.</p>

<p>In other personal updates, I‚Äôve been trying to find a solution to my want for a personal Minecraft Java server, that can be public, and also have some addons, <em>without it costing nearly 60 dollars a month</em>. And it would seem that the only current solution there would potentially be for this, would be to host the server entirely myself, on my <em>own</em> system. Which, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like to do.</p>

<p>Since I currently pay Linden Labs to have my own personal homestead where I host my store, and some other little things, it wouldn‚Äôt currently make sense to suddenly erect a Minecraft server that adds on to those costs.</p>

<p>Everything costs too much in 2025.</p>

<p>In relation to my music, and the ongoing album I‚Äôve been working on, I haven‚Äôt had much of a chance to move forward with this yet, but I think it <em>is</em> a good idea to periodically talk about how I‚Äôve decided to drop the ‚ÄúPLEXX‚Äù project, and move everything back to <a href="https://eyeshadow2600fm.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Eyeshadow 2600 FM</a>. As long and as nonsense as the name is for this musical project, I decided that there‚Äôs really no reason to abandon pieces of the past, <em>just</em> because I was weird about naming things 8 years ago.</p>

<p>And, as for my book, ‚ÄúDissolution Protocol,‚Äù I haven‚Äôt really made a whole lot of progress on this. In fact, as soon as ‚ÄúAI‚Äù became a thing, I mostly stopped progressing in writing entirely. Unless, you know, it has to do with writing on my website.</p>

<p>This is still something I‚Äôm working through, trying to grasp at reasons to continue, while there are potentially hundreds of thousands of people out there drooling over the chance to rip-off anyone and everything for their own personal gain.</p>

<p>But, that‚Äôs mostly it from me in regard to personal updates.</p>

<p>As another reminder, I‚Äôm running an old-school kind of bulletin board over at <a href="https://forum.mkultra.monster/" target="_blank">forum.mkultra.monster</a>, where you can sign up, drop a thread, start a conversation, and maybe even contribute to starting up a community! Go on, give it a shot. There‚Äôs no downside to setting up an account, and hey, maybe you‚Äôll enjoy this little slice of old-net that I‚Äôm propping up for a few bucks a month on a VPS.</p>

<p>And, finally, if you know of a Minecraft Java server solution that doesn‚Äôt cost an arm, leg, and an eyeball to put up and run for fun, let me know! My comment section should be working on here, or you can just @ me at <a href="https://labyrinth.zone/daemon_nova" target="_blank">daemon_nova@labyrinth.zone</a>.</p>

  <p>Krafton is very open about its pro-AI advocacy ‚Äì it has a whole section of its website dedicated to its Deep Learning division, which works to use generative AI to ‚Äúincrease game productivity‚Äù by generating art, animation, and voices, translating research into real-world tools, creating ‚ÄúVirtual Friends‚Äù you can play games with and talk to, virtual influencers that can livestream games, and probably more that isn‚Äôt stated on the website.</p>

<p>Wow, that‚Äôs a lot of horrible things to shotgun all at once!</p>

<p>But, don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre only using things people made for free, or work that they‚Äôve already had done for them by actual artists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúAll AI features within InZOI utilize proprietary models developed by Krafton and are trained using solely company-owned and copyright issue-free assets and data,‚Äù Suri explains. ‚ÄúIn addition, inZOI‚Äôs AI capabilities are built into the client as on-device solutions and therefore do not make communications online with external servers.‚Äù</p>

<p>As if it <em>somehow</em> makes it seem better, to announce that you‚Äôre outsourcing jobs in your company to an algorithmic machine that‚Äôs choking the atmosphere, but with things people didn‚Äôt ask for money for, or things you‚Äôve already paid actual human beings to make.</p>

<p>Okay, I get it. I‚Äôm cynical, and sick-to-death of talking about this. But, all across social media, or, at least, <em>corporate</em> social media, there are endless people thoughtlessly Ghibli-ifying themselves, or clamoring about how great they think it is to use a hallucinating chatbot as a replacement for critical thinking, and now that same brain-drain garbage is leaking into an art form.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have much hope for the world. I don‚Äôt have much hope for art. I <em>lost</em> hope in most people a long time ago.</p>

<p>But, if you‚Äôre like me, and you‚Äôre sick of this trash, join my club. The Never-AI-in-My-Damn-Games club, and don‚Äôt buy this. Don‚Äôt buy anything by any developers or studios who‚Äôve decided that having artists isn‚Äôt productive enough, or a waste of money.</p>

This still pales in comparison to what it costs to have a whole entire PC, but hold up a second. Not only will the console cost you 500 dollars, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank">the digital edition of games will be 80 dollars, and the physical copies wil be 90 USD</a>, on a case-by-case basis (apparently). As we all know, the last studio that did something like this, caused a cascade that made nearly <em>every new title</em> 70 bucks. But, there‚Äôs something <em>all of them</em> are ignoring.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs quickly becoming apparent that owning a PC <em>or</em> a console is something only people with extra, or <em>lots</em> of money will be doing, in the extreme near future. <em>Especially</em> if Nintendo is successful in pushing standard edition games to 80 and 90 dollars. As if we‚Äôre all made of money while the economy is tanking far past the toilet, and into hell itself.</p>

<p>But, I remember a time when I used to buy multiple games per month. Now I buy a single game every couple months, or maybe two if I‚Äôm feeling like I don‚Äôt care. Maybe more if they go on sale at steep discounts.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt how it used to be.</p>

<p>But, I wanted to talk less about the rising prices of games without any thought for the people who buy them (because who cares if we price out an entire class of people from an art form), and more about the <em>thing</em> that all of these studios and publishers are ignoring.</p>

<p>You can play perfectly fun, good, and highly detailed games <em>on your phone</em>, and ‚Ä¶ <em>for free</em>.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs right.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre no longer in the era of Candy Crush being a staple of mobile gaming.</p>

<p>You can play <em>Call of Duty</em> on your phone, without spending a single dime. Which is <em>hilarious</em>. The studio that brought you microtransaction-shooter-hell, that releases with a new title every 6 months at 70 to 100 bucks, also gave you a way to play the <em>same exact thing, for free, on your phone</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can play a game that‚Äôs basically a copy-paste of Breath of the Wild, for FREE (Genshin Impact).</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt like either of those?</p>

<p>Phones got Minecraft, also. And it‚Äôs free.</p>

<p>Or maybe you‚Äôd prefer Runescape.</p>

<p>No? How about the entire native Warframe experience?</p>

<p>Or even PUBG!</p>

<p>The thing is, I think a lot of these studios are banking on the idea that most gamers (see: people who play games) <em>don‚Äôt take phone gaming seriously</em>. But, why shouldn‚Äôt they?</p>

<p>You can whip out a cheap adapter, and plug an HDMI cable <strong>into a 200 dollar Android</strong>, and play <strong>on your TV, with a wireless controller</strong>.</p>

<p>Or, you know, you can just ‚Ä¶ hold your phone, and play while laying down, on your back, in your comfy bed, and pop off forty straight kills in a CoD team deathmatch.</p>

<p>But hey.</p>

<p><em>Hey.</em></p>

<p>Maybe you would prefer to spend 150 dollars on the next Call of Duty title for your 700 dollar console. Or your 2000 dollar PC.</p>

<p>Is it time to take mobile gaming seriously?</p>

<p>Bro, most of us are <em>already</em> taking it seriously.</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="nintendo" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, just a few days ago, it was announced that the Switch 2 will be nearly 500 dollars.

That thing being, Minecraft ARGs, or ‚Äúalternate reality games.‚Äù Wherein, some user will post, or say they‚Äôre ‚Äúreposting‚Äù something from over a decade ago, of a strange series of videos, from a near vacant Youtube account. And then as you watch said videos, there‚Äôs a string of creepy, horrific, or sad things that happen as this ‚ÄúYoutuber‚Äù plays through Minecraft (and each video will usually have clues or hidden links, etc).</p>

<p>You might be thinking, ‚ÄúThe hell? You‚Äôre almost 40, right? Minecraft is for KIDS!‚Äù</p>

<p>Maybe you‚Äôre not thinking that.</p>

<p>But, I <em>do</em> think it sometimes, to myself. Mostly, because I was an alpha-buy-in for the original Minecraft, and I have definitely noted the extreme family-friendly shift the game made over the last decade. Not that this is <em>hugely</em> a problem, or anything. I still very much enjoy logging onto my realm and figuring out how exactly to make my base not be really basic and boring.</p>

<p>Anyway!</p>

<p>There are two Minecraft ARGs that really stick out to me as extremely well done. At least, of what I‚Äôve watched so far. But, I don‚Äôt go through the whole game of picking through videos, and figuring out what‚Äôs going on. I just watch someone do it for me.</p>

<p>But, the first one isn‚Äôt really an ARG, it‚Äôs more like a short film.</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs great.</p>

<p>This one is a dive into a short Minecraft film called ‚ÄúABANDONED.‚Äù Which is in the style of something of a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play‚Äù sort of deal, except the player‚Äôs Minecraft world is ‚Ä¶ haunted. With commentary from the Youtube channel, trone(y)sauce (because this is how <em>I</em> stumbled upon it, and I didn‚Äôt really object to having commentary and a dissection of what happened).</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdV73N_PmZo?si=wlDtB5LS5znWy7d5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Now, this didn‚Äôt really scare me or anything, it was just <em>really</em> interesting to watch. Because, I‚Äôve never seen people do things like this with Minecraft.</p>

<p>I thought it was all just semi-weird-ish adults doing exaggerated Let‚Äôs Plays for kids.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>After you‚Äôre done watching that one, you <em>absolutely have</em> to watch, ‚ÄúMy Minecraft World is Deleting Itself ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5HVis7SmP4?si=HXnQhPnLnSXdKEDU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This one <em>is</em> an ARG, and I also watched it from another Youtuber‚Äôs perspective, as they themselves explain all of the details. And, this one isn‚Äôt really scary or anything either. It‚Äôs, actually, a really sad story.</p>

<p>But, I‚Äôll let you watch it and figure out for yourself if you can come to the conclusion on what it‚Äôs about before Wifies explains it for you, at the end.</p>

<p>Again, this is content that‚Äôs just revolving around Minecraft. I would have never expected to find things like this, and I can‚Äôt wait to see if there‚Äôs anymore!</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="minecraft" /><category term="args" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In continuing my new trend of just yapping, I wanted to point out something that I‚Äôve been kind of enjoying lately (especially since quality Backrooms Youtube content has kind of dried up for me).

They thought I was simply releasing music and ignoring everything else.</p>

<p>Well, this is on-going and continuing proof that I do buy, and also listen to music. Especially nowadays, as my album creation process is <em>much, much slower</em> than it used to be.</p>

<p>Up first! We have ‚Ä¶</p>

<p><em>Whitewoods</em>, <a href="https://mypetflamingo.bandcamp.com/album/spaceship-earth" target="_blank">Spaceship Earth</a>. I grabbed this album, because it sounded like a mixture of new wave pop-punk and synth-y vaporwave, which, I think, is <em>exactly what it is</em>.</p>

<p>Next up is, <em>t e l e p a t h „ÉÜ„É¨„Éë„Ç∑„ÉºËÉΩÂäõËÄÖ and Áå´„Ç∑ Corp.</em>, <a href="https://geometriclullaby.bandcamp.com/album/--45" target="_blank">„ÉÜ‚Äã„É¨‚Äã„Éë‚Äã„Ç∑‚Äã„Éº‚Äã„ÅÆ</a>. Which is, for all intents and purposes, a <em>much more</em> traditional type of vaporwave. You‚Äôve gotta have the traditional type, along with its variations. At least, <em>once</em>, in your Bandcamp shopping sprees.</p>

<p>I support vaporwave a lot more nowadays, because it sounds exactly like something you might hear while you‚Äôre lost in the Complex / Backrooms.</p>

<p>Third in today‚Äôs purchases, is <em>LAST CEREMONY</em>, <a href="https://businesscasual87.bandcamp.com/album/dial-up-daydreams" target="_blank">DIAL-UP-DAYDREAMS</a>. This is some more mega-vapor tunes, with a call-back to nineties internet surfing. Basically, all you need to do in order to get me to buy your album, is to theme it around 90s internet. That‚Äôs it!</p>

<p>Fourth, is <em>glaci√¶re</em>, with <a href="https://hiraeth-records.bandcamp.com/album/pool-water-blue" target="_blank">pool water blue</a>. A very <em>dreamy</em>, vaporwave, kind of liminal space sounding album, with definite eighties synthwave influences mixed within. Listening to this, only a few tracks in, it‚Äôs a <em>must buy</em>.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt really buy anything that‚Äôs purely ‚Äúeighties synthwave‚Äù much anymore, mostly due-in-part to the way a lot of the people in that music community treated me. But, I do still listen to and enjoy its influences.</p>

<p>And, <em>finally</em>, what would a Bandcamp shopping spree be if I didn‚Äôt buy, <em>Mabisyo</em>, with <a href="https://mabisyo.bandcamp.com/album/sun-colored-eyes" target="_blank">Sun Colored Eyes</a>. This is the second Mabisyo album I‚Äôve grabbed, and, just like the first time, this is <em>professional grade</em> dreamy vapor-synth. And, while a lot of these albums have obvious influences from Japan, and its music (think lo-fi j-pop), this is definitely one of the most notable.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it for now! I could probably go on an infinite shopping spree and just grab <em>every single thing</em> that catches my eye, but my bank account wouldn‚Äôt like that much. So, we‚Äôll save the next 5 albums I buy for either my next payday, or next month. Or, maybe May‚Äôs Bandcamp Friday? We‚Äôll see!</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Music" /><category term="music" /><category term="albums" /><category term="bandcamp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I decided I wanted to write about albums I buy on Bandcamp, partly because when I was still being extremely, over-the-top prolific about making music back on Twitter (before the twitter-synthwave community effectively excommunicated me due to a large portion of them being extremely bigoted), some didn‚Äôt think I was buying any music.

If you‚Äôve been following my little journey in hollowing out a piece of the internet that isn‚Äôt annoying, dominated by corporations, and their engagement tricks, you‚Äôve likely seen me popping up this website, erecting a phpBB forum, and you‚Äôve probably also noticed that people all over the place are making GeoCities-ish type websites for fun! Well, the revival of the old-net goes even deeper than that.</p>

<p>Ever since Meta turned on Facebook, things have gotten worse, and worse. MySpace got sold off and changed into something completely different (a janky website for bands???). AOL Instant Messenger went offline, <em>for good</em>. Twitter plopped into the ether, Tumblr became a replacement for LiveJournal, and then for a decade everyone only visited four websites.</p>

<p>That was ‚Ä¶ until people got tired of the algorithms, and the disingenuous content of people and corps who use social media to pump stats and shun actual social interaction.</p>

<p>Out came Mastodon on the ActivityPub network, and, although ActivityPub existed for <em>a long time</em> before Mastodon‚Äôs rise, I feel like <em>this</em> is exactly where people started rebuilding, for <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>You see, the internet is a lot like space. You can build a wall. You can put up a ton of interstellar checkpoints that flash a million ads in your face as you navigate around each system. But, as soon as people realize that space is not a two dimensional plane, and that they can just, fly in a different direction, things start to change.</p>

<p>AOL Instant Messenger, reborn!</p>

<p>Exactly a year ago today, the <a href="https://github.com/mk6i/retro-aim-server" target="_blank">Retro AIM Server</a> repo appeared on Github. A project that effectively open sourced the AOL Instant Messenger servers. In that, <em>you</em>, or <em>anyone</em>, can just host a server that people can use the <em>actual</em> old software to connect to.</p>

<p>But you don‚Äôt need to do all of that.</p>

<p>All you need to do is use the links in the repo to download AIM to your system of choice. I‚Äôm on Linux, so I had to use Wine to open it. No biggie.</p>

<p>Then, you need a server, right?</p>

<p>I gotchu.</p>

<p>All you‚Äôve got to do is <a href="https://sso.chivanet.org" target="_blank">go here</a>, and create an account. Then, in the AIM section, create your username and password.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre done!</p>

<p>Open the original AIM client, follow the instructions from the repo that tell you where to put your connection info, and sign on!</p>

<p>You‚Äôre back, or, if you were born in the 2000s, you‚Äôre here for the first time!</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> issue, is this is not something that‚Äôs on a billion person network. So ‚Ä¶ having buddies will not be something you ‚Ä¶ <em>have</em>, right away. But, that‚Äôs okay, because you can have me as your first buddy. My AIM name is Atomleiche.</p>

<p>Just click the ‚Äú+/- setup‚Äù button on the bottom right, then click ‚Äúadd buddy‚Äù and type in my username. Then confirm it. If I‚Äôm online, you‚Äôll hear the sound of a door opening, and then you can just double-click me and send a message!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs that simple!</p>

<p>And this is how it worked back on the old-net. You added buddies, and then when they came online, it was time chat. Or not! Some people would just add me back in the day to expand their list, I think. Who knows. But I had a whole lot of buddies, who I‚Äôm sure have completely different lives now. Maybe none of them think about this stuff anymore. Maybe they do!</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know.</p>

<p>But, I feel like this is still only the beginning.</p>]]></content><author><name>‚∏∏ commander ‚ñë nova ‚∏∏ :~$</name></author><category term="Social-Media" /><category term="social-media" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="internet" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Queue Inception bwam sound. If you‚Äôve been following my little journey in hollowing out a piece of the internet that isn‚Äôt annoying, dominated by corporations, and their engagement tricks, you‚Äôve likely seen me popping up this website, erecting a phpBB forum, and you‚Äôve probably also noticed that people all over the place are making GeoCities-ish type websites for fun! Well, the revival of the old-net goes even deeper than that.]]></summary></entry></feed>
