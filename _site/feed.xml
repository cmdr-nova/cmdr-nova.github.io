Do you miss that? Oh, yeah, me either. But, the old part of Twitter I’m actually talking about here, are the bots that people used to setup, that read from their tweets, and then shot out a randomized post. I think some of them were called like, “John Reads” or “John Books”, wherein they’d put their name and qualify it with something related to writing or reading. Either way, remember that? Do ya?</p>

<p>Well, I recreated that in a bot, that reads from a spreadsheet of your posts, jumbles it, randomizes it, restructures it, and then posts them semi-logically, to <em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/post_gen_bot" target="_blank">post_gen_bot on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, in my use-case for this, I have it reading from Google Sheets I’ve generated as backups of every single post I’ve made to Mastodon since the beginning of 2024, because … I just didn’t know what to do with all of that, <em>until now</em>. But, I’m assuming, if you really wanted to, you could feed your old backed-up tweets from a deleted Twitter account, <em>into this bot</em>, and then have it post jumbled nonsense from your posting-past on social media.</p>

<p>That’d be kinda neat, right?</p>

<p>Now, this is like the 4th or 5th bot I’ve made? I don’t know, I’m losing count already.</p>

<p>But, I <em>have</em> had a little bit of aggression directed toward me via the fediverse. Because, some people just don’t think. They don’t consider what they’re doing, or read what they’re targeting. They don’t particularly <em>care</em> if you’ve spent time making something interesting, or neat, and would simply request that you mute, delete, and ban your work.</p>

<p>To those people, I say, lighten the frikk up. Don’t waste your reports, just use the <em>mute</em> function. I don’t make these things to please other people, or to meet your expectations or specific specifications of what <em>you personally</em> believe the fediverse should be. I do this <em>for me</em>. And if you don’t like that, <em>you don’t have to see it.</em></p>

<p>It reminds me of years back, on another Mastodon account, where I was posting about Tomb Raider and how cool the iteration of the game I was playing, happened to be, and this … I don’t want to call them “extremely online,” because there was something <em>else</em> wrong with them, entirely, but this person came into my notifications, and they were like, “I don’t care about Tomb Raider, why are you talking about this?”</p>

<p>And I was taken aback, like … There are legitimately people out there who fully and completely believe the entire world, and everyone in it, revolves around <em>them</em>, specifically. And that’s frikken <em>nuts</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t think this is a problem that only exists on Mastodon, though. I think this is wide-spread, across all of social media, and the internet, and it’s only been exasperated by a society that celebrates individualism and isolation, and so on, and so forth. I could go on for hours, but this is a topic for another time.</p>

<p>Either way, for those that like bots, here’s another one for you.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you remember on Twitter, back in the golden days, when the worst part of the website were the people who were addicted to finding things they thought were bad about other people, and then creating dunk posts, and dogpiles?

I started screwing around with Python after spending time casually reading about it, and decided to learn it, hands-on, and I smashed up a slew of interesting things. Then, I started thinking about, despite my love for Linux, and especially Debian, there are some critical things I still don’t have access to while <em>on</em> Linux.</p>

<p>Such as things I use for my creations in Second Life, like Quixel, Marvelous Designer. And how I’m basically <em>locked</em> to only using Gimp. And, regrettably, there <em>are</em> a few games I want to play that I just can’t. With these things in mind, I decided to mess around and put Windows on my System76 machine. It wasn’t all <em>that</em> painful, because I have all of my important stuff backed up on the cloud, and I don’t mind redownloading games as I decide I’m interested in playing them.</p>

<p>But … And this could end up being the reason I decide to just put Linux back onto my PC: Turning Windows into a machine for a developer is a <em>pain in the ass</em>.</p>

<p>From configuring SSH, to realizing I didn’t have OpenSSH, to installing OpenSSH, to configuring PowerShell, to downloading the actual latest version, to screwing with SSH keys, to adding, deleting, adding, deleting, adding, deleting, and adding and deleting about 15 different keys, before I generated a new one, and then <em>manually pasted the key</em> into the authorizations <em>on my Debian server</em>.</p>

<p>Oh, but then there’s VS Code … An apparent Microsoft centric developer app, that crashes against a wall as soon as you try to push and sync? Because apparently, or at least in my case, it doesn’t know to <em>use OpenSSH</em>?!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here I am, with access to all of my games, and every single program I used to use, and <em>also</em> my developer tools setup exactly the same way they were in Pop!_OS.</p>

<p>I do have to say that I really like Pop!_OS, but I’m <em>not</em> that excited about merging and migrating my entire system to the Rust based COSMIC. I don’t know. I … kind of like Ubuntu, you know?</p>

<p>All that aside, we’ll see how long this lasts. Despite the shortcomings, Linux is really a revolutionary OS, and I’ll probably put it all back sometime in the future. Probably when I get tired of the games I wanted to play, and decide to figure out the workarounds for the apps I want to use in Windows (I don’t like using Virtual Machines, I just want to interact with my actual PC).</p>

<p>But, until then, I’m going to see how far I can stretch Windows into giving me control of the system.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, it’s been an interesting week and a half.

So I spent some time trying to figure out how to make and rebuild Mafia Wars from the ground-up. I achieved … some things, but it’s proving to be something that will take a long time, and I kinda just wanna chill and have some fun? So, I made it so that my Reddit-Bot also posts random status (which are predefined), that are pulled from a json file.</p>

<p>As it turns out, small-time bots are a little bit easier. The way that I accomplished this, was by making a <em>secondary</em> bot, that uses the same Mastodon access codes, and runs every 13 minutes, outside of the 10 minute window that the Reddit bot uses (simulating what a normal person might post like … if they were a bot).</p>

<p>You can see the Chatter-Bot <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/chatter-bot" target="_blank">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I’m aware that all these little worker-bots I’ve built have all been built before, albeit, probably in different ways, and with different code. But these all <em>also</em> work, and they do specific things that I’m sure the others probably don’t.</p>

<p>I updated the Reddit-Post bot to include Reddit usernames and the subreddit that they came from (so that it’s more clear), and I made it so the bot will periodically look for followers, and follow new follows plus unfollow defollows (emulating a real influencer!).</p>

<p>As far as the Chatter-Bot goes, it also has embedded replies that it’ll shoot at you if you send it a mention. This is structured much the same way the status posts are, except they’re only used when someone goes, “Hey @net_run@mkultra.monster, what the hell are you on about?”</p>

<p>Now … in regards to my “Mafia Hustle” Mafia Wars clone, uh. Yeah, I’m just gonna set that aside for now! Might return to it at a later date.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, it’s my day off, you know.

<p>Have you ever thought to yourself, “Man, why do I have to copy/paste blog post links and then also post them? I have more important things to do, like jorkin it in the club, you know, with my peanuts.”</p>

<p>Well, friend, you are in luck today.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/blog-poster" target="_blank">Blog-Poster</a>. He’ll dig into your RSS feed, post whatever’s new straight to Mastodon, and then archive it in a permanent ignore list, just so he’s sure never to mistake something that’s old, for something new.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Of course, you can give him a new name, like “Barry” or “Fart Face.” It doesn’t matter to me!</p>

<p>I still have lots to learn, and I’m starting to retain more and more as I do this, but I realize that programming is a very large and long road. Heck. I’ve been screwing with HTML since about 1999, and I still have to keep Google open to reference CSS modules and what-not. Plus, I’m getting older, and stuff just slips out of my brain juice and then it’s gone with the wind.</p>

<p>Either way, that’s all I have to write about for now, cause tomorrow’s my day off from my offline job, and I’m about to chill, and do nothing. Or make a 4th bot.

<p>You heard me.</p>

<p>When there is no more room in hell, the anime boobs will walk the Mastodon.</p>

<p>Obviously, there is some room for failure here. Failure, in that, sometimes people post AI-generated sludge to Reddit, and that <em>may</em> get caught in the bot. If it happens too often, I’ll either figure out how to exclude that stuff, or just not include that specific subreddit in the bot’s pull.</p>

<p>This is sort of still ongoing, too. I tried a bunch of different tricks to get the bot to stop posting the preview, tiny, pixelated image, but to no avail. Or, maybe to vail. It <em>may</em> be just my instance that isn’t uploading them correctly, but I’m not sure yet.</p>

<p>If you want to see the bot directly, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/@net_run" target="_blank">it’s here</a>. Warning, though, some of the posts it grabs are NSFW and entirely lewd. You have been warned.</p>

<p>This is pretty cool, though, because, the last time I did <em>anything</em> like this, it was a <strong>chatbot</strong> that I integrated with a <a href="https://gnusocial.network" target="_blank">GNU Social</a> (still around today) instance I was running, way, way back in … 2017, I think?</p>

<p>Kinda brings back memories, even if that instance is completely lost to time, and only viewable in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180314155440/http://sanguine.merylscarlett.info/" target="_blank">fragments of an Apache default page</a> on archive.org.</p>

<p>As for Python, so far it feels like writing CSS, but with a lot more statements, and also things that can go wrong!</p>

This is incongruent with current trends of the past decade and a half, of the music industry pushing real hard for streaming. Streaming, which pays fractions of a penny of a penny on a dollar, while the rich consume the profits. This has only been exasperated since AI came into the scene, with people absent of talent and inspiration, generating <em>absolute garbage</em> (and this isn’t just a problem in music, it’s everywhere).</p>

<p>I personally haven’t seen, heard, or noticed any detrimental effects of Bandcamp being bought-out, but it’s good to be prepared. To be prepared in an age where Mozilla is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/advertising/" target="_blank">suddenly an ad agency</a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-copilot-recall-cybersecurity-disaster" target="_blank">developing spyware</a>, OpenAI is asking governments for enough <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank">electrical power</a> to destroy the entire planet, and Apple is <a href="https://applescoop.org/story/shocking-apple-vision-pro-2-reportedly-cancelled" target="_blank">releasing products</a> people <em>don’t want</em>.</p>

<p>We’re living in a universe that is slowly becoming a perpetual backwards day (not that Microsoft was ever a decent forward-thinking company, or that OpenAI ever had any good intentions with their grift of theft, but I digress…).</p>

<p>But there are those who read my musings, who know I’m a freak for the fediverse.</p>

<p>You might guess where this is going.</p>

<p>“Wait, are you about to tell me that there’s a motherfuggin’ Bandcamp, ON THE FEDIVERSE?”</p>

<p>Yes, yes I am about to tell you that, Fortnite Gamer.</p>

<p>This morning, while I was slogging away at getting ready for work, I saw a post flash past my Mastodon feed, something like, “It’s Bandcamp, but on the fediverse!”</p>

<p>I thought to myself, “Hmm, okay. I’ll bookmark this for 10 hours from now.”</p>
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="img-wrap">
<img src="/img/posts/bandwagon/tenhours.png" />
</div>
</div>
<p>So, I clicked the link and followed through to <a href="https://bandwagon.fm" target="_blank">Bandwagon.fm</a>, and, my dudes …</p>

<p>I now have a “bandcamp” on the fediverse, <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/@cmdr_nova" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

<p>Save for the ability to actually <em>sell</em> your music (which I assume they’re working on?), you can upload whole entire albums here, and then people can stumble in and listen to what you’ve made! That’s WILD. … on the FEDIVERSE?!</p>

<p>What I did here with my page, though, is I took the 3 most recent albums I did under Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and re-published them under my new name, PLEXX. Once I <em>finally</em> finish <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX</a>, I’ll be putting that album there, too.</p>

<p>But this is <em>so cool</em>, and it’s connected to Musicbrainz, another open-source music cataloguing project!</p>

<p>Earlier today, I was having second thoughts about Linux, and sticking to open source and all that. Mostly because, I sort of miss a few programs that I’m having trouble getting working on Pop!_OS. But this kind of turned me around a bit. There’s <em>no</em> reason to go back to the bastardized version of whatever Bill Gates had in mind 30 years ago. This proves to me that regular people <em>will</em> restore the internet to what it should have always been.</p>

<p>The only thing it takes, is <em>patience</em>, and a whole lot less second-guessing myself and my decisions. And also maybe I need to sit in front of my computer screen a little less here and there. My eyes hurt.</p>

<p>Anyway, I <em>can’t wait</em> to see what the heck comes next, holy crap.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure there are those who know that Bandcamp was recently bought out by a company called Songtradr, and this came with much dismay, because Bandcamp has been, and has mostly remained, one of the only music platforms where small artists could actually be discovered, heard, and paid.

<p>Enter: the_daily_report</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/the_daily_report/tree/main" target="_blank">simple python script</a> that you need only make a personal Reddit app for, and then you’re done (mostly).</p>

<p>I’m still a bit of a noob, learning all of this stuff as I go, like you do, and <em>how I do</em>. So, I’m writing this with it scheduled to send me my daily report at 9am, everyday, and guess what, it works!</p>

<p>Voila:</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/thereport/the_report_example.png" /></p>

<p>I initially had to do a ton of troubleshooting, because my machine <em>doesn’t</em> just automatically send e-mails when I tell it to, and I’ve detailed as much of that as I could in a troubleshooting section via the repository. Hopefully it’s clear enough what needs to be done.</p>

<p>I have this issue where, I’ll use someone’s app, and then their help files make no sense, or are woefully incomplete. In writing my own, I now see why that may happen, because I’m basically just throwing in solutions I used and hoping they stick!</p>

<p>Now, <em>obviously</em>, this means you have to have your PC turned on at all times, unless of course you setup a server on a remote PC, such as renting a VPS over at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. I’ve <em>considered</em> this for myself, but I don’t know if sending myself a daily report of trending posts in subreddits is really something I should just dump money into. Mostly, because I <em>do</em> have my PC on at all times, in-between minutes every couple of days that I restart the thing.</p>

<p>But it’s an option!</p>

<p>Anyway, you can see the whole thing in the link above, and hopefully, if I’ve done my job correctly, you can get it running for yourself.</p>

Largely, because, I ditched Wordpress and decided to build something from scratch. It seems, in light of the Wordpress CEO’s recent blunders, it was <em>probably a good idea</em> to abandon Wordpress. But I really only did it because I enjoy writing everything in VS Code, rather than a glitchy editor. Nevertheless, I still have Automattic’s “jetpack” app installed on my phone, and it serves me interesting writing prompts every once in a while, and because I don’t enjoy writing about a crisis every single time I fire up the VSC, I think I’ll snag this one.</p>

<p>So, full-stop, I had access to a computer in about 1992, I believe. I think I spoke about this before, but it was something my Dad was provided by his job, and it <em>wasn’t</em> exactly up-to-date with current versions of Windows. It was more like a mid-80s machine with <em>extremely</em> early versions of DOS, and bulletin boards. The menu was built into a permanent console, like something you write through via Linux (for the zoomies who don’t know what the hell DOS is), and it was … pretty basic.</p>

<p>I think that thing is still sitting around, <em>somewhere</em> out there.</p>

<p>As time marched forward, we got another PC, and another PC, and then a Gateway 486, and then that was largely what I used, until I was given another “hand-me-down”-ish PC when I was around 15 or 16. About the time I discovered anime forums, and started e-dating as many girls as I could … with video chat over aol instant messenger, and … a whole lot of embarrassing things I probably shouldn’t have been sharing with girls I, ultimately, <em>didn’t really know</em>, at all.</p>

<p>Then, when I graduated, I was gifted <em>another PC</em>, which is when I <em>really</em> started gaming. And then years later I built one myself, and then I upgraded it, and then I bought another PC. And then I ditched that one, and bought one in 2018, and then I ditched that one, too, and bought the powerhouse Linux PC I’m currently using today (alongside the Windows Dell, and Macbook I have as side machines).</p>

<p>What would life be like, had none of this ever happened?</p>

<p>I guess I’d probably watch paint dry? Or, am I still allowed to have my iPhone? Cause, if that’s the case, I guess the only thing that’d be different is I’d probably be some kind of prolific mobile gamer, who never got into web development. Maybe I’d be streaming to Twitch via my phone as I bumble around Genshin Impact. Who knows!</p>

<p>But, let’s say the phone is also a computer.</p>

<p><em>This question is far too open-ended for the 2020s, don’t you think?</em></p>

<p>So, no PC, no laptops, no phone, no toasters with touch-screens, and we’ll just assume, in this version of the universe, my job <em>also</em> hasn’t given me a phone to work with.</p>

<p>Alright.</p>

<p>Since television is mainly on streaming now, and basic “appointment TV” doesn’t really exist anymore (and by that, I mean, episodic television that isn’t dumped all at once), I guess I’d probably have a Smart TV, and I’d probably spend <em>a lot</em> of my time watching shows. Maybe I’d also read a lot more. I don’t know if I’d be writing, because … I guess I’d have to do that by <em>hand</em>? Like a <strong><em>baby</em></strong>. But, that’s the thing, a smart TV is also a computer! We’ll, for the sake of this post, just pretend that it isn’t, though.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I’d have a richer social life, because I think factors that made it harder for me to connect with people in the 2020s, <em>aren’t</em> really related to having access to a PC, but more that people in-general are, or have, isolated themselves in their own little bubbles of media that they themselves dictate. Which, in-turn, makes casual conversation <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p>But … without access to all of the world’s knowledge and information, I guess I’d probably be a lot more uninformed. I’d probably be much more susceptible to just <em>believing</em> anything anyone tells me. I’d probably question things less. I wouldn’t have random college credits sitting on my name, and I guess I wouldn’t have a resume, either?</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>

<p>Uh, I think we’ll skip this universe.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty important to have access to technology, and the internet. Because, just sitting here thinking about what life would be like <em>without</em> all this stuff, sounds … horrifying. And, maybe that’s nerdy. But damn, dude, no. No I don’t think I’d want to live a life of watching TV and sleeping.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Writing Prompt" /><category term="writing-prompt" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been at least two months since I’ve done one of Jetpack’s writing prompts. Largely, because, I ditched Wordpress and decided to build something from scratch. It seems, in light of the Wordpress CEO’s recent blunders, it was probably a good idea to abandon Wordpress. But I really only did it because I enjoy writing everything in VS Code, rather than a glitchy editor. Nevertheless, I still have Automattic’s “jetpack” app installed on my phone, and it serves me interesting writing prompts every once in a while, and because I don’t enjoy writing about a crisis every single time I fire up the VSC, I think I’ll snag this one.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">You Wake Up, And It’s 2012 Again</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2024/10/02/you-wake-up-and-it-s-2012-again.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="You Wake Up, And It’s 2012 Again" /><published>2024-10-02T17:11:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-02T17:11:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2024/10/02/you-wake-up-and-it-s-2012-again</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2024/10/02/you-wake-up-and-it-s-2012-again.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written a lot about how much I miss the 90s, and sometimes pine for an age in the 80s, and, obviously, I’m not talking … politically.

Drinking our Ecto-Coolers, slipping on Velcro sneakers, uh, watching Rocko’s Modern Life.</p>

<p>But sometimes I also wish it was still 2012. Still in the midst of the Mass Effect trilogy, the greatest game series <em>ever created</em>. Still logging onto a <em>mostly</em> normal Facebook to get my daily clicks in Mafia Wars and Farmville.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/2012/mafiwars.png" /></p>

<p>A time when Sims 3 was the latest and greatest of the franchise, and <em>all I was doing</em> in the game was walking my sim around collecting diamonds and rocks, and trying to figure out what kind of bathroom she should have. When I was still mystified by new experiences, and finding wonder in exploring new narratives. Back when the iPhone still had what I think were the best icon graphics, a headphone jack, and iPods! Yeah, I had an iPod Touch! …that I played digital poker with.</p>

<p>When I’d jump on Google cam-chats with friends, lay in bed, and just talk all night long, and when Youtube was just a place where people uploaded random weird stuff that wasn’t designed to pull you in and keep you there for ad-rolls and sponsored segments.</p>

<p>… when cigarettes only cost like, four dollars a pack.</p>

<p>A year wherein I’d get out of work and still have the energy to <em>do things that I enjoy</em>.</p>

<p>I miss 2012.</p>

<p>There’s no use living in the past, but there were <em>a lot</em> of great things about technology in the 90s, and 2000s, and even 2010. And then suddenly it all started going downhill. Things <em>advanced</em>, but for <em>no reason</em>. Oh boy, bigger cameras, larger screens, thinner bezels, s … streaming? I don’t <em>own</em> my music and movies anymore? All the casual games I liked using to pass time are on my phone? Sweet! … oh, almost <em>all of them</em> are copies of each other and filled with so much money-grubbing they could only really be classified as a game for the first 5 minutes that you interact with it?</p>

<p>Instagram is about posting engagement-bait and getting popular with short-form content until you can … get sponsored with product placement?</p>

<p>Twitter got murdered by Elon Musk and now it’s just nazis and ai-gen spam?</p>

<p>What the <em>heck</em>?</p>

<p><strong><em>I miss 2012.</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s not all bad. We got Mastodon, we got a federated network of users taking ownership of their content, and the indie web (a revival of the 90s internet). There are still <em>good</em> games out there, and a whole lot of indie developers who make some real gems. But, <em>man</em>, do you really have to sift through mountains and oceans of garbage to find content and entertainment <em>actually worth consuming</em>.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I’m just getting older, and everything is just <em>fine</em> the way it is.</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve written a lot about how much I miss the 90s, and sometimes pine for an age in the 80s, and, obviously, I’m not talking … politically.

For the first time ever, not only is [REVOSA] part of this event, but so is Ayashi Systems, or <em>AyaSys</em>, my secondary store.</p>

<p>Come on down to the <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Progeny/172/116/21" target="_blank">Progeny Mall</a> and check them both out.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you’d like to visit my store instead, <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">come on over</a> and see the updated location!</p>

<p>Either way, thank you for joining me in the continued revival of activity within my Second Life store, even as my offline job saps all the energy out of me.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like last month, [REVOSA] (my Second Life store), is once again appearing in the Progeny Mall shopping event!
