And I thought, “You know, I <em>hate</em> how I have to manually create new pages for every tag I put on a post. What is this? 1927?” So, I set out to fix that problem, and fix that problem I did. But it didn’t come without a small hiccup.</p>

<p>Because, apparently, Github Pages can only use a <em>certain</em> Jekyll version (which is ridiculous), so, if you were attempting to do this with a custom ruby gem, you <em>wouldn’t be able to run it</em>, unless you stop using the github_pages defined “safe” plugins. Oh no! And switching to full Jekyll, while cool and good, will <em>break</em> GH Pages, and maybe other things! So, instead of building this into the workflow, and having separate this, and separate that, I said, “Hell no, what? We got Python for that.”</p>

<p>And Python we did done do.</p>

<p>I’m the kind of person who likes to write. I <em>also</em> like to do all of my writing in VS Code, because it makes me feel cool. And, part of writing, is <em>removing</em> obstacles that make it tedious, and repetitive. Such as copy/pasting links to my new posts, and spreading them across social networks (a problem solved by my server and a ton of scripts), or tagging your posts like you would on Wordpress, and then having to create each tag page manually, so that they can be clicked on.</p>

<p>Like I said on the <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/Jekyll-Tag-Generator" target="_blank">Github repository</a> for these scripts I’ve created … What am I? A caveman?</p>

<p>It seems like, the <em>more</em> I do the same things over and over, the <em>more</em> I need automation to take care of the boring stuff I don’t want to do.</p>

<p>You know.</p>

<p>Those things that AI was supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>I’ve been copying and pasting links to blog posts and sharing them on social media, for decades. <em>Decades</em>. So, when I figured out how to make all of that happen <em>automatically</em>, it was like a dehydrated man in the Sahara Desert discovering a pond. And, after that, it was just <em>more</em> identifying little annoying tasks that take away from doing <em>what I want to do</em>, and then <em>eliminating</em> them. Like the Terminator and a billion Sarah Connors.</p>

<p>But I still haven’t figured out how I want to automatically fetch post IDs for shared post links on Mastodon, and then copy them into said new posts, so that Mastodon comment sections are generated automatically.</p>

<p>We’ll get there, though!</p>

<p>Uh …</p>

<p>Soon!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="scripting" /><category term="programming" /><category term="python" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="github" /><category term="tags" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was trying to think of something new to do with my website while I sip a very large beverage this evening, heading into another day off.

I’ve dated a lot of people. Thirty-some-odd people. But I also, kind of, in my brain sauce, circle back to the one woman with whom I thought would last. None of them last. But her and I were <em>different</em>. We were different, and then we were over.</p>

<p>Inevitably, she broke up with me for some dude at Starbucks, and I was angry, and then I was sad, and then I forgot about her for a while when I initially started my transition. Sometimes I wonder if that breakup is what triggered it. I’m not transitioning now, and I don’t know if I’ll ever return to it, but that’s a whole story. I enjoy navigating my life being confused about gender, and just being forward-facing however I feel like being. But I heard from her once or twice over the years. Over the course of the last fourteen years. And I don’t know <em>why</em> I still think about her.</p>

<p>There are so many other ex girlfriends I could think about. I could think about the one I was with long-distance for a year, who disappeared overnight while I was sleeping, only to come back in Discord messages three years later to apologize.</p>

<p>I could think about the one whose rent I paid and drove to New York, who inevitably broke it off with me to get back with her estranged husband.</p>

<p>I could think about the two women I dated in separate states, who used me for their own gain in different ways, and then tossed me aside like a broken toy.</p>

<p>Hell, I could even think about my highschool girlfriend, who somehow remains a part of my life, in some tiny, almost insignificant way.</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>My head always circles back to <em>the one</em>.</p>

<p>And I don’t even know what it is about her anymore. I don’t think it’s important. I don’t think I even exist to her in 2024, and rightfully so. <em>Why would I?</em></p>

<p>But it makes me feel like, or wonder, if one of the reasons I have such a hard time, in my near forties, getting <em>close</em> to anyone, is because I <em>refuse</em> to let go of the past. Most of the time all of my thoughts are living in the nineties, or the early 2000s, and I think of myself as I was then, rather than how I am and who I am, <em>now</em>. Everything is me trying to escape what I currently <em>am</em>, and it’s a wonder that even <em>with</em> more matches than I can shake a stick at on dating apps, <em>I talk to no one</em>.</p>

<p>The present is crumbling all around us, and simultaneously, I’ve never been in a better position in my <em>entire life</em>.</p>

<p>And I’m still working on myself, on all of these things, and I’m getting <em>better and better</em> by the day, <em>at everything</em>.</p>

<p>So then why can’t I let go of the past? Why can’t I ever shake this person, the starbucks-betrayer, out of my head, <em>once and for all</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t know. Maybe this public journal post will derive some kind of enlightenment … ten years into the future when I’m hopefully married and not sitting alone in front of a computer like I always am.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, while I was working away, (not on the code I shared in my other post, but at work), I suddenly fell into this kind of melancholy.

I wasn’t happy with cbox as a “guestbook” of sorts. It was intrusive, and it was nothing more than an injection of code from some other source, controlled by some other person. That’s no good. I want to be in control of <em>everything</em> having to do with, and running on my website. Therefore, I made GuestPoast.</p>

<p>GuestPoast, available to check out <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/GuestPoast" target="_blank">over on Github</a>, is a relatively simple guestbook system that you can setup and use on a static website. In this case, we’re using Jekyll, because that’s what I know best at this point. But! Because we’re using Python, I’m running those scripts on a VPS with a reverse proxy, and runners that keep the guestbook comments live, <em>at all times</em>. There is a way to use Github to run Python, among other things, but I’m a little turned off by the limitation of working seconds (I honestly don’t know how much I’d use if I used Github as a personal VPS. I have a lot of things running over at Digital Ocean).</p>

<p>But, once you’ve got it all setup, you can then <em>also</em> dive into the JavaScript side of the project, and add naughty words, or <em>slurs</em>, that you don’t want nefarious users to post. Or, you can troll your visitors by not allowing them to say certain things like, “Hello.” Not sure why you’d want to do that, though.</p>

<p>This is one, in a long line of things I’ve been wanting to do with my website. Ultimately, I’d like my site to be <em>fully</em> integrated with ActivityPub, but whether that’s actually possible or not remains up-in-the-air. And then, of course, we have Bluesky threatening to overtake all social networks. And, I mean, I <em>like</em> Bluesky. But it’s less <em>technical</em> feeling. It’s less <em>mine</em>. My Mastodon instance is my own, the things I do, post, and develop that interact with it <em>are my own</em>. Mastodon, to me, feels like an extension of my Linux operating system. And maybe that’s why the normals don’t like it so much. I don’t know, I’m rambling in my thoughts.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this new development I’ve put up for free public consumption!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Web Dev" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, yesterday, I got home from work late, and wanted to do something more with my website.

We talked about the ways in which artists, writers, or creators in-general are taken from, at all angles, with the promise of a boost, or fame, or an income. And I’m still thinking about it.</p>

<p>It really feels like the AI that scrapes the web for everything ever made by a human being, in order to create amalgamations that look like nightmarish gloss-puke is the endgame to all of this. But I’ve jumped into the epilogue before we explore the content of the text.</p>

<p>For decades, creative work has always been demanded by those who <em>don’t</em> create, to be free. It got to the point that these things were so devalued by the general public, that it spawned music streaming services that pay fractions on the fraction of another fraction of a penny. It spawned entitled attitudes that get slung at artists doing commissions, that they should not <em>dare</em> charge a fair hourly rate for their work, that they should be grateful for <em>exposure</em>. It spawned endless compendiums of amateur, indie-fiction, because getting into a publishing house is more like a whole <em>scam</em> nowadays.</p>

<p>And, eventually, it spawned the full and total pillaging of all of this work, funneled straight to those who believe an idea is worth more than work.</p>

<p>But I wanted to talk more about another side to all of this.</p>

<p>As a person who creates, how do you get the word out to people? Do you post on social media and pray that people don’t demonize you for “advertising?” Do you pay for a blue checkmark on Threads in the hopes that it translates into the work that you do <em>actually being seen</em> and <em>appreciated</em> by people?</p>

<p>Have you seen the playlisters in online music scenes who charge artists money to have their music placed on thousand-listener lists? Have you been a store creator in Second Life whose only avenue to advertising their work, is by paying hundreds of dollars to land owners who host store events (this example is a little niche, but directly related to things I personally do)? Have you paid social media coaches to tell you how to post online to draw in the most engagement possible? Queue the random trash-question-posting and rage-bait.</p>

<p>Or, maybe, as an author, or <em>indie</em> author, you’ve spent years querying, only to have your work potentially stolen by a narcissistic agent who posts on Twitter about how she thinks someone <em>else</em> should have your idea, and do it better.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/creators/agents.webp" /></p>

<p>In our society, it <em>really</em> seems like the artist, the writer, the maker, the doer, is constantly in a web of traps, laid out by the grifters. Everyone wants to make money off of you, off of your ideas, off of your <em>work</em>, while you squabble in debt, and minimum wage. And the most infuriating part is, <em>they do</em>.</p>

<p>“Pay me, and I’ll make sure you see that success you’ve been grasping for.”</p>

<p>Pay, pay, pay!</p>

<p>One of the reasons my next novel has been basically frozen in time, is because sometimes I <em>really</em> feel like it’s pointless to put something out there. Especially now, that … as soon as you do, it’ll be gobbled up by the plagiarism machines.</p>

<p>I’ve seen <em>so much</em> of this in all that I do, because I’ve been doing these things <em>my whole life</em>. And the scammers, the grifters … they <em>all</em> have the louder voice, the largest influence, and it makes <em>no sense</em> to me.</p>

<p>It makes no sense that these types of people and this type of behavior really receives no pushback, whatsoever.</p>

<p>But then I remember the decades past, the squawking about how all of the things you spend hours, days, weeks, <em>months</em> on, <strong>should</strong> be free, and if you <strong>have</strong> to sell it, it should be <em>dirt cheap</em>.</p>

<p>It <em>creates</em> the condition where you start to feel as though <em>you have no choice</em> but to cough up cash to those who believe any money made from the things that you do, <em>belongs to them</em>.</p>

<p>And then the cycle repeats, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Do you wanna know how much I make from streaming without any advertising on the part of paid services, monthly?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/creators/music.png" /></p>

<p>But we don’t currently live in a society that enables any kind of environment where this can be fixed. We live in the society that will make this worse. And you’re only option in the creation of dreams, art, prose, and more, <em>is to do it for the love of it</em>, and nothing else. Because if you don’t have even <em>that</em>, then what’s the point of anything?</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was having a conversation with a singer in Second Life yesterday, and it quickly went down the road of parasocial relationships, expectations, and suddenly, money-traps.

Yes, I posted an <em>unfinished</em> version of it. But now, if the universe looks kindly upon me, <em>it is done</em>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <strong><em>POAST</em></strong>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/poast" target="_blank">Now on Github</a>, I’ve uploaded the scripts needed in order to make this work for <em>your own</em> Jekyll blog. You should note that this is <em>specifically</em> for Jekyll, and you <em>will</em> need a VPS of some kind to host poast.py. Unless you’re magic, and you can run Python on a static site.</p>

<p>If you don’t know where to start with all that, I suggest taking a look at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>, where you can rent a bare bones VPS for the lowest spec at like 6 dollars a month. And that’s really <em>all you need</em> for poast.py to run (you don’t even need its lowest spec, you could probably execute this script on a 486).</p>

<p>Now, one of the things I mention in the readme on Github, is that I’m using the root user to make this happen. I want to reiterate here, you <em>probably</em> shouldn’t do this, and would be better off making a new user in order to put all of this together. But, I like to live dangerously, and also I don’t feel like reconfiguring everything and moving stuff around.</p>

<p>So it’s whatever.</p>

<p>I consider this project one of my bigger achievements, because it took me a <em>long time</em> to get to this point. Had I more testosterone and <em>more</em> anger, building these scripts could have driven me to put a fist through a wall at times.</p>

<p>But this is one of the things I’ve been wanting to do, ever since I ditched Wordpress and moved to Jekyll. Because, the way I see it, if you can think of it, <em>you can build it</em> (with Python? maybe … Rust?).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this is useful for someone other than me, and, as a side note, if you scroll down on this website and click the DOOM Guy face, you can play a little DOOM.</p>

<p>Edit: I’ve been informed that you <em>are</em> actually able to execute Python in a Github workflow bash. Queue me, tearing out all my hair. Nevertheless, this repo will remain unchanged until/if I decide to utilize this approach (which would be limited by Github’s monthly seconds, anyway).</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Scripting" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you may be asking yourself, “Hey, didn’t you already post the code to this directly on your blog?” And the answer to that question would be, yes.

And … now it does!</p>

<p>You’ll notice, if you’re on desktop, the toggle switch is up at the top left. If you’re reading this on mobile, the toggle will be at the top of the main page (outside of posts, and pages you’ve navigated to). Now, if you feel like you don’t want to be saturated in darkness, you can switch on <em>bone-meal mode</em>. Which, despite disliking most light mode settings on websites, is <em>actually</em> pretty easy on the eyes, due to it not being full-blown, eye-bleaching white.</p>

<p>This is more reminiscent of a forum I used to visit as a 15 year old in high school, by the name of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020324043350/http://animeboards.com/" target="_blank">animeboards.com</a>. A website that I have <em>fond</em> and also <em>bad</em> memories of (my first interaction with online trolls happened here). This also reminds me that I’d <em>love</em> to setup an old school style PHPBB forum … but I don’t know how I would get people to join, <em>of if they’d even want to.</em></p>

The first thing I did was delete a bunch of fluff from the sidebars. The next thing I did was make some JavaScript that automatically updates my avatar and author name on posts (and other pages) with whatever I’m using on Mastodon, completely dynamically.</p>

<p>I put both JavaScript files into a repository on GitHub, along with an explanation on how to use them, <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/dynamic_mastodon_info" target="_blank">here</a>. No CORS headers or proxy servers required (this is a frequent problem with things I do here)!</p>

<p>Basically, what both scripts do, is simply read the meta tags from your profile, <em>on Mastodon</em>. All you have to do is make sure that you run these scripts in the head of your HTML, input your user profile <em>into</em> the top of the scripts, and then include each script’s class in an &lt; img &gt; tag and an &lt; a &gt; tag.</p>

<p>And that’s it!</p>

<p>Now you can screw around and change your avatar and username on Mastodon, and <em>any time you do that</em>, it’ll be updated on your website.</p>

Obviously, there are reasons to be on Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and for some, it’s a race to the finish line, as to which one “wins” the main-character-social-media-site award.</p>

<p>But I don’t believe either of the three options will ever be the “main-line, main-character” choice. I think people will continue from this point forward, having specific things they want to accomplish and do online, and the place they go will depend on those very things.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you join Threads, you’re probably a fan of Instagram, and you’re looking to connect with, maybe, your audience, or something. And then there’s the ex-Twitter users spilling over, because, it <em>is</em> for sure something <em>like</em> Twitter.</p>

<p>Then you have Bluesky, the site that’s billing itself to be a Twitter replacement, gaining users rapidly, and there are definitely reasons you <em>shouldn’t</em> build a site in order to be the <em>next Twitter</em>. But, there are caveats of Bluesky, in that, you can post your balls and ass, and you won’t get censored. And lots, and <em>lots</em> of people love to do that, on Bluesky, <em>specifically</em>.</p>

<p>And then there’s the community building, the list-making, and the large portion of LGBTQ+ users flocking to the site.</p>

<p>It <em>could</em> contend to be a place that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>And then you have Mastodon, basically, where <em>everyone</em> else goes. Linux enjoyers, and developers alike, <em>especially</em>. And one of the <em>only</em> social media places on the internet that isn’t run by either a billionaire, or backed by some kind of venture capital.</p>

<p>But what does it mean to use the other two?</p>

<p>Obviously, Zuck is a billionaire, a billionaire who definitely has bad ideas, and bad opinions. On the flipside, like mentioned in one of my recent articles, Bluesky is backed by Bitcoin Capital, run by people who know Steven Bannon intimately. So, are you <em>really</em> ultimately in for <em>anything different</em> than what you were exposed to on Twitter?</p>

<p>Maybe, <em>maybe not</em>.</p>

<p>I do think, though, that it’s becoming kind of muddy to say, “You shouldn’t use this, you should use <em>that</em> instead” because, as I’ve just mentioned, both Threads and Bluesky have issues with influence from … the darker side of politics, and the world.</p>

<p>Notice how I don’t mention Mastodon, or ActivityPub in that, because AP is exactly what you make it. But, if I’ve learned anything, <em>very many</em> people want to sign up on something and then forget about it, <em>forever</em>. Which is not something you do on Mastodon. On Mastodon, you have to be an <em>active</em> participant, almost <em>at all times</em> in order for it to become something that you enjoy. And, let’s face it, if you look at regular, normal users on Threads (for example), there are droves, and droves of people wholly uninterested in social participation, and more interested in a viral post that’ll make them an imaginary millionaire.</p>

<p>At this point, I don’t think it matters too much what you use between the three, and fighting about it is a worthless endeavor. Bluesky and Threads are both connected to ActivityPub in different ways, <em>anyway</em>. So … you could say that Mastodon has already won this metaphorical social media war.</p>

<p>But, again, I don’t think these things matter.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> think you should consider your environment, and what the people who facilitate it believe, and say, on a regular basis. You <em>should</em> think critically about your participation online, be it via Threads, Bluesky, or <em>even</em> Mastodon.</p>

<p>And you most definitely shouldn’t be on Twitter.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I have to go to work on a rare overnight shift, I wanted to write about the current social landscape, and less about some kind of perceived competition between Threads and Bluesky, and more about what it means to use these platforms.

In the 90s we had webrings with select websites we wanted to connect with, and share with others. In blogging we have “blogrolls,” and on social media we’ve had “follow fridays” for … forever. And, in regards to the fediverse, numerous people have put together lists of users they think others should follow. So, by all means, Bluesky’s version of this is really <em>nothing new</em>, except in that they call follow lists “starter packs.” In that spirit, I’ve made my own, for the fediverse.</p>

<p>You can <a class="page-link" href="/pages/fedi-starter">check out my starter pack</a>, and follow via the little follow button I’ve positioned next to each user’s name (yes, I’ve included myself). And this is by no means an exhaustive and complete list! Currently, I’ve slapped this together in about thirty minutes, after having come home from work, napped, and ate a pizza. The list contains those I enjoy seeing on my timeline, and I <em>fully</em> intend to keep adding to it!</p>

<p>Recently, I wrote about how I felt Bluesky was growing on me a little. Mostly in that, I don’t feel like you need to fully <em>avoid</em> it, and it does have its worth. In comparison to the fediverse though, I think I do still <em>mostly</em> prefer my instance, that I run <em>myself</em>, that I moderate <em>myself</em>, on an open protocol that is entirely run by regular normal people (save from the companies connecting or planning to connect to ActivityPub). And I <em>do</em> still have concerns about Bluesky, like how it recently received funding from a <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/bluesky-reaches-13-million-users-announces-funding/730989/#:~:text=On%20that%20front%2C%20Bluesky%20has,able%20to%20continue%20its%20development." target="_blank">crypto company</a>, and it could <em>totally</em> be bought by a billionaire with no morals at <em>any second.</em></p>

<p>It’s for those reasons, I’d like to continue building on the fediverse, and this will eventually also include “building” in regards to my scripting and app development. I don’t want to <em>just</em> have scripts referencing Reddit forever. I’ve mostly used Reddit as a testing ground for ideas.</p>

<p>But, anyway, I hope my starter pack helps you find new people to follow (even though it’s a bit tiny at the moment)!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea of a “social media starter pack” is nothing new.
