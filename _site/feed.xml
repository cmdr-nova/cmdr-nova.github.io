<p>The positive to this, is, I don‚Äôt have to worry about storage constraints with posting procedurally generated images to Bluesky, infinitely, <em>forever</em>. And the way I‚Äôve made the Python and JavaScript pairing, is that, once this is generated, and posted, it gets deleted from the server. Foolproof. Fullproof? Which is the right word? The world may never know.</p>

<p>But, I worry about the future a lot, and I like to preserve the things I do so that, <em>no matter what happens</em>, there‚Äôs always a contingency. So, now my social media Python stuff <em>also</em> has a contingency. And there‚Äôs this, alongside maybe 8 or 9 other scripts that run on a continuous basis, or on intervals depicted by cronjobs, on <strong><em>just a six dollar per month VPS over at Digital Ocean</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it gets slow at times. I‚Äôve logged into my server to suddenly experience severe lag. So much so, that now I have daily restart times in order to start fresh, and then throughout the day, lag builds, and builds, and builds, and then it restarts again (lol).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm <em>sure</em> there‚Äôs something I could do to make whichever script is causing this more efficient, but it all still works, regardless!</p>

<p>Just exactly what I‚Äôll do next, I‚Äôm not sure. But I <em>do</em> think if I keep going I‚Äôll have to upsize the droplet. Or, maybe this is <strong>enough</strong> for now.

<script async="" src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I bring this person‚Äôs Bluesky post here, not because they‚Äôre some kind of arbiter of Bluesky vs. Mastodon as a topic, but <em>just because</em> this is a sentiment I see <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, a lot of people just want to input a username, a password, and then sign-in and start posting. At risk of sounding inflammatory, or cynical, <em>people don‚Äôt want to think.</em></p>

<p>But it seems to go beyond that. Choosing a server, joining a community, expressing your interests, and sharing who you <em>really are</em>, should be something <em>fun</em>, right? But throughout the attached thread, this is apparently seen as as <em>barrier</em>. It‚Äôs seen as ‚Ä¶ gatekeeping?</p>

<p>And then the issue with ‚Äúfilters‚Äù for posts, or, what they‚Äôre called on Mastodon, <em>content warnings</em>. I‚Äôve seen <em>so many people</em> express discontent with having to use them, when to use them, <em>why</em> they‚Äôre expected to. A lot of people just want to post, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my dissertation on the current political climate, and why you should panic,‚Äù and expect that no one would be like, ‚ÄúHey, could you maybe not do this without some kind of warning?‚Äù Because, and I have to start again with things that sound like uncharitable takes, <em>they don‚Äôt want to consider other people when they say and do things?</em></p>

<p>That <em>sure</em> is a sentiment of your average ‚Äúinfluencer,‚Äù or people who wish they were.</p>

<p>What is an influencer? Someone who posts with an inflated sense of self, who assumes that people are fans, followers are their adoring masses, that you should come to them, and accept what they have to say, and what they do, because <em>they‚Äôre special</em>, and you are a peasant.</p>

<p>What I really think about all of this, is that this is a sickness that was generated by Twitter. It was curated, crafted, and instilled into the masses over years, and years of use of the platform. The algorithm was made to incentivize selfishness, and venom, and so, therefore, that‚Äôs how people began to act, that‚Äôs how they started to use social media.</p>

<p>Twitter was <em>bad</em> well before it was ever bought out by a megalomaniac.</p>

<p>And now we have ‚Ä¶ a clone of it?</p>

<p>Okay, so Bluesky is good. There are <em>a lot</em> of cool features, and hey! You <em>can</em> sorta, by proxy, connect it to Mastodon!</p>

<p>But <em>because</em> it‚Äôs billed as like this ‚Ä¶ exact Twitter clone, <em>that‚Äôs how people are treating it.</em> They‚Äôre bringing that behavior, they‚Äôre bringing that inflated ego syndrome, they‚Äôre bringing the venom, and they‚Äôre <em>continuing it</em>.</p>

<p>And when they‚Äôre faced with the idea of joining communities, and being social, and being thoughtful of others, it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs seen as a bad thing.</p>

<p>In the beginning, in parenthesis, I mentioned how I wouldn‚Äôt want to lose my instance, and if I did, it would be too heartbreaking for me to move, and find a new place to be on the fediverse. And it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been on Mastodon since 2017, and I‚Äôve been in <em>many</em> places. My instance is <em>my home</em>, and I think if I lost it, I would probably concede myself to my Bluesky account.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not to say that <em>you</em> shouldn‚Äôt at least give Mastodon a chance. That‚Äôs not to say that you <em>shouldn‚Äôt</em> look to learn, and find ways to be social online, again. But, for me, the way I exist on the fediverse, is with my own blood, sweat, and tears.</p>

<p>But I do think decentralized islands are probably the future?</p>

<p>And maybe I‚Äôm wrong, maybe I <em>would</em> stick around on the fediverse, even <em>if</em> I lost mkultra.monster. Who knows, I don‚Äôt know. The future is a variable I don‚Äôt know.</p>

<p>What I do know is ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure Bluesky will make it. I‚Äôm not sure Bluesky will make it, because they‚Äôre backed by big money, by people <em>you absolutely should not trust</em>, who will <em>eventually</em> need to raise their own money, and that‚Äôs exactly how Twitter became an X. Take my words with a grain of salt. But there‚Äôs a reason that the newest generation of teenagers becoming adults are <em>bad</em> at making social connections. That, all people, are connecting <em>less</em>. And it‚Äôs not just because society has become more frantic, more driven by greed.</p>

<p>There are <em>billions</em> of people online, and hundreds of millions of people across Threads, X, Bluesky, and Mastodon, and there are <em>many more</em> social media apps that I haven‚Äôt even mentioned here. But the one constant that I‚Äôve noticed on most of them, is that genuine connection is <em>hard to come by</em>. Even on Mastodon, for as socially connected and more thoughtful that it is. I, myself, struggle to connect with people. I don‚Äôt know what to say, I don‚Äôt know what to do.</p>

<p>Sometimes I hit people with a ‚Äúlike‚Äù and then I keep on posting. But sometimes I reach out, and I try to be conscious of what I say, and what I do, and that‚Äôs <em>largely</em> because of the time I‚Äôve spent on the fediverse.</p>

<p>Is that <em>really</em> a bad thing? Is that gatekeeping? Is that ‚Ä¶ <em>user-hostile</em>?</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="mastodon" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I‚Äôve explored this topic before, but it keeps coming up on my timeline.

Have you ever visited a webpage and thought to yourself, ‚ÄúMan, I wish there was like, a huge mountain of data and pictures for me to stare it!‚Äù Well, my friend, I am here to give you exactly that. With JavaScript and Python, I give you, Pixelfed, and my latest product from Second Life!</p>

<p>Tooling around with Pixelfed‚Äôs API was a little frustrating, and I <em>still</em> haven‚Äôt figured out what I was doing wrong in order to pull statuses <em>directly</em> from the source (with an access code). So, in order to do this, regardless, I decided to utilize my Pixelfed profile atom feed to do <em>exactly</em> what I was trying to accomplish. RSS is the past, and also the future! ‚Ä¶ apparently.</p>

<p>If you scroll down and look to the left, you‚Äôll see the five most recent photos from my Pixelfed account, which will update automatically as I add new things to it.</p>

<p>After that, I took my simmering migraine headache, and made some scripts to take a look at my Second Life store‚Äôs marketplace page. Pointed some python at it and said ‚ÄúAssemble the link, then open the link, then extract the photo and the title.‚Äù</p>

<p>Done.</p>

<p>Down on the right of the page, you can see my latest product from my Second Life store, and if you click it, you‚Äôll go right to the page!</p>

<p>At this point, I have <em>kind of</em> a large amount of content connected to API and my proxy servers, all pulling information from the different platforms I interact with, <em>as I update them</em>. And that‚Äôs what automation is all about.</p>

<p>Removing obstacles to things I want to do, and things I want to show the world.</p>

<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm not sure I feel like putting these code snippets and scripts onto Github today. My head <em>hurts</em>, like <em>ass</em>.</p>

<p>So, that‚Äôs the post.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="scripting" /><category term="programming" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="github" /><category term="tags" /><category term="second-life" /><category term="blogging" /><category term="pixelfed" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In more themes around developing automation for my daily internet-life, I decided to make even more little features for my website.

And I thought, ‚ÄúYou know, I <em>hate</em> how I have to manually create new pages for every tag I put on a post. What is this? 1927?‚Äù So, I set out to fix that problem, and fix that problem I did. But it didn‚Äôt come without a small hiccup.</p>

<p>Because, apparently, Github Pages can only use a <em>certain</em> Jekyll version (which is ridiculous), so, if you were attempting to do this with a custom ruby gem, you <em>wouldn‚Äôt be able to run it</em>, unless you stop using the github_pages defined ‚Äúsafe‚Äù plugins. Oh no! And switching to full Jekyll, while cool and good, will <em>break</em> GH Pages, and maybe other things! So, instead of building this into the workflow, and having separate this, and separate that, I said, ‚ÄúHell no, what? We got Python for that.‚Äù</p>

<p>And Python we did done do.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm the kind of person who likes to write. I <em>also</em> like to do all of my writing in VS Code, because it makes me feel cool. And, part of writing, is <em>removing</em> obstacles that make it tedious, and repetitive. Such as copy/pasting links to my new posts, and spreading them across social networks (a problem solved by my server and a ton of scripts), or tagging your posts like you would on Wordpress, and then having to create each tag page manually, so that they can be clicked on.</p>

<p>Like I said on the <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/Jekyll-Tag-Generator" target="_blank">Github repository</a> for these scripts I‚Äôve created ‚Ä¶ What am I? A caveman?</p>

<p>It seems like, the <em>more</em> I do the same things over and over, the <em>more</em> I need automation to take care of the boring stuff I don‚Äôt want to do.</p>

<p>You know.</p>

<p>Those things that AI was supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been copying and pasting links to blog posts and sharing them on social media, for decades. <em>Decades</em>. So, when I figured out how to make all of that happen <em>automatically</em>, it was like a dehydrated man in the Sahara Desert discovering a pond. And, after that, it was just <em>more</em> identifying little annoying tasks that take away from doing <em>what I want to do</em>, and then <em>eliminating</em> them. Like the Terminator and a billion Sarah Connors.</p>

<p>But I still haven‚Äôt figured out how I want to automatically fetch post IDs for shared post links on Mastodon, and then copy them into said new posts, so that Mastodon comment sections are generated automatically.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll get there, though!</p>

<p>Uh ‚Ä¶</p>

I‚Äôve dated a lot of people. Thirty-some-odd people. But I also, kind of, in my brain sauce, circle back to the one woman with whom I thought would last. None of them last. But her and I were <em>different</em>. We were different, and then we were over.</p>

<p>Inevitably, she broke up with me for some dude at Starbucks, and I was angry, and then I was sad, and then I forgot about her for a while when I initially started my transition. Sometimes I wonder if that breakup is what triggered it. I‚Äôm not transitioning now, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever return to it, but that‚Äôs a whole story. I enjoy navigating my life being confused about gender, and just being forward-facing however I feel like being. But I heard from her once or twice over the years. Over the course of the last fourteen years. And I don‚Äôt know <em>why</em> I still think about her.</p>

<p>There are so many other ex girlfriends I could think about. I could think about the one I was with long-distance for a year, who disappeared overnight while I was sleeping, only to come back in Discord messages three years later to apologize.</p>

<p>I could think about the one whose rent I paid and drove to New York, who inevitably broke it off with me to get back with her estranged husband.</p>

<p>I could think about the two women I dated in separate states, who used me for their own gain in different ways, and then tossed me aside like a broken toy.</p>

<p>Hell, I could even think about my highschool girlfriend, who somehow remains a part of my life, in some tiny, almost insignificant way.</p>

<p>But no.</p>

<p>My head always circles back to <em>the one</em>.</p>

<p>And I don‚Äôt even know what it is about her anymore. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs important. I don‚Äôt think I even exist to her in 2024, and rightfully so. <em>Why would I?</em></p>

<p>But it makes me feel like, or wonder, if one of the reasons I have such a hard time, in my near forties, getting <em>close</em> to anyone, is because I <em>refuse</em> to let go of the past. Most of the time all of my thoughts are living in the nineties, or the early 2000s, and I think of myself as I was then, rather than how I am and who I am, <em>now</em>. Everything is me trying to escape what I currently <em>am</em>, and it‚Äôs a wonder that even <em>with</em> more matches than I can shake a stick at on dating apps, <em>I talk to no one</em>.</p>

<p>The present is crumbling all around us, and simultaneously, I‚Äôve never been in a better position in my <em>entire life</em>.</p>

<p>And I‚Äôm still working on myself, on all of these things, and I‚Äôm getting <em>better and better</em> by the day, <em>at everything</em>.</p>

<p>So then why can‚Äôt I let go of the past? Why can‚Äôt I ever shake this person, the starbucks-betrayer, out of my head, <em>once and for all</em>.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know. Maybe this public journal post will derive some kind of enlightenment ‚Ä¶ ten years into the future when I‚Äôm hopefully married and not sitting alone in front of a computer like I always am.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, while I was working away, (not on the code I shared in my other post, but at work), I suddenly fell into this kind of melancholy.

We were different, and then we were over.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Put a Functioning Guestbook On Your Jekyll Site</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/web%20dev/2024/11/18/put-a-functioning-guestbook-on-your-jekyll-site.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Put a Functioning Guestbook On Your Jekyll Site" /><published>2024-11-18T20:16:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-11-18T20:16:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/web%20dev/2024/11/18/put-a-functioning-guestbook-on-your-jekyll-site</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/web%20dev/2024/11/18/put-a-functioning-guestbook-on-your-jekyll-site.html"><![CDATA[<p>So, yesterday, I got home from work late, and wanted to do something <em>more</em> with my website. I wasn‚Äôt happy with cbox as a ‚Äúguestbook‚Äù of sorts. It was intrusive, and it was nothing more than an injection of code from some other source, controlled by some other person. That‚Äôs no good. I want to be in control of <em>everything</em> having to do with, and running on my website. Therefore, I made GuestPoast.</p>

<p>GuestPoast, available to check out <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/GuestPoast" target="_blank">over on Github</a>, is a relatively simple guestbook system that you can setup and use on a static website. In this case, we‚Äôre using Jekyll, because that‚Äôs what I know best at this point. But! Because we‚Äôre using Python, I‚Äôm running those scripts on a VPS with a reverse proxy, and runners that keep the guestbook comments live, <em>at all times</em>. There is a way to use Github to run Python, among other things, but I‚Äôm a little turned off by the limitation of working seconds (I honestly don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôd use if I used Github as a personal VPS. I have a lot of things running over at Digital Ocean).</p>

<p>But, once you‚Äôve got it all setup, you can then <em>also</em> dive into the JavaScript side of the project, and add naughty words, or <em>slurs</em>, that you don‚Äôt want nefarious users to post. Or, you can troll your visitors by not allowing them to say certain things like, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù Not sure why you‚Äôd want to do that, though.</p>

<p>This is one, in a long line of things I‚Äôve been wanting to do with my website. Ultimately, I‚Äôd like my site to be <em>fully</em> integrated with ActivityPub, but whether that‚Äôs actually possible or not remains up-in-the-air. And then, of course, we have Bluesky threatening to overtake all social networks. And, I mean, I <em>like</em> Bluesky. But it‚Äôs less <em>technical</em> feeling. It‚Äôs less <em>mine</em>. My Mastodon instance is my own, the things I do, post, and develop that interact with it <em>are my own</em>. Mastodon, to me, feels like an extension of my Linux operating system. And maybe that‚Äôs why the normals don‚Äôt like it so much. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm rambling in my thoughts.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this new development I‚Äôve put up for free public consumption!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Web Dev" /><category term="webdev" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, yesterday, I got home from work late, and wanted to do something more with my website.

We talked about the ways in which artists, writers, or creators in-general are taken from, at all angles, with the promise of a boost, or fame, or an income. And I‚Äôm still thinking about it.</p>

<p>It really feels like the AI that scrapes the web for everything ever made by a human being, in order to create amalgamations that look like nightmarish gloss-puke is the endgame to all of this. But I‚Äôve jumped into the epilogue before we explore the content of the text.</p>

<p>For decades, creative work has always been demanded by those who <em>don‚Äôt</em> create, to be free. It got to the point that these things were so devalued by the general public, that it spawned music streaming services that pay fractions on the fraction of another fraction of a penny. It spawned entitled attitudes that get slung at artists doing commissions, that they should not <em>dare</em> charge a fair hourly rate for their work, that they should be grateful for <em>exposure</em>. It spawned endless compendiums of amateur, indie-fiction, because getting into a publishing house is more like a whole <em>scam</em> nowadays.</p>

<p>And, eventually, it spawned the full and total pillaging of all of this work, funneled straight to those who believe an idea is worth more than work.</p>

<p>But I wanted to talk more about another side to all of this.</p>

<p>As a person who creates, how do you get the word out to people? Do you post on social media and pray that people don‚Äôt demonize you for ‚Äúadvertising?‚Äù Do you pay for a blue checkmark on Threads in the hopes that it translates into the work that you do <em>actually being seen</em> and <em>appreciated</em> by people?</p>

<p>Have you seen the playlisters in online music scenes who charge artists money to have their music placed on thousand-listener lists? Have you been a store creator in Second Life whose only avenue to advertising their work, is by paying hundreds of dollars to land owners who host store events (this example is a little niche, but directly related to things I personally do)? Have you paid social media coaches to tell you how to post online to draw in the most engagement possible? Queue the random trash-question-posting and rage-bait.</p>

<p>Or, maybe, as an author, or <em>indie</em> author, you‚Äôve spent years querying, only to have your work potentially stolen by a narcissistic agent who posts on Twitter about how she thinks someone <em>else</em> should have your idea, and do it better.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/creators/agents.webp" /></p>

<p>In our society, it <em>really</em> seems like the artist, the writer, the maker, the doer, is constantly in a web of traps, laid out by the grifters. Everyone wants to make money off of you, off of your ideas, off of your <em>work</em>, while you squabble in debt, and minimum wage. And the most infuriating part is, <em>they do</em>.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPay me, and I‚Äôll make sure you see that success you‚Äôve been grasping for.‚Äù</p>

<p>Pay, pay, pay!</p>

<p>One of the reasons my next novel has been basically frozen in time, is because sometimes I <em>really</em> feel like it‚Äôs pointless to put something out there. Especially now, that ‚Ä¶ as soon as you do, it‚Äôll be gobbled up by the plagiarism machines.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen <em>so much</em> of this in all that I do, because I‚Äôve been doing these things <em>my whole life</em>. And the scammers, the grifters ‚Ä¶ they <em>all</em> have the louder voice, the largest influence, and it makes <em>no sense</em> to me.</p>

<p>It makes no sense that these types of people and this type of behavior really receives no pushback, whatsoever.</p>

<p>But then I remember the decades past, the squawking about how all of the things you spend hours, days, weeks, <em>months</em> on, <strong>should</strong> be free, and if you <strong>have</strong> to sell it, it should be <em>dirt cheap</em>.</p>

<p>It <em>creates</em> the condition where you start to feel as though <em>you have no choice</em> but to cough up cash to those who believe any money made from the things that you do, <em>belongs to them</em>.</p>

<p>And then the cycle repeats, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Do you wanna know how much I make from streaming without any advertising on the part of paid services, monthly?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/creators/music.png" /></p>

<p>But we don‚Äôt currently live in a society that enables any kind of environment where this can be fixed. We live in the society that will make this worse. And you‚Äôre only option in the creation of dreams, art, prose, and more, <em>is to do it for the love of it</em>, and nothing else. Because if you don‚Äôt have even <em>that</em>, then what‚Äôs the point of anything?</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was having a conversation with a singer in Second Life yesterday, and it quickly went down the road of parasocial relationships, expectations, and suddenly, money-traps.

Yes, I posted an <em>unfinished</em> version of it. But now, if the universe looks kindly upon me, <em>it is done</em>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the <strong><em>POAST</em></strong>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/poast" target="_blank">Now on Github</a>, I‚Äôve uploaded the scripts needed in order to make this work for <em>your own</em> Jekyll blog. You should note that this is <em>specifically</em> for Jekyll, and you <em>will</em> need a VPS of some kind to host poast.py. Unless you‚Äôre magic, and you can run Python on a static site.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt know where to start with all that, I suggest taking a look at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>, where you can rent a bare bones VPS for the lowest spec at like 6 dollars a month. And that‚Äôs really <em>all you need</em> for poast.py to run (you don‚Äôt even need its lowest spec, you could probably execute this script on a 486).</p>

<p>Now, one of the things I mention in the readme on Github, is that I‚Äôm using the root user to make this happen. I want to reiterate here, you <em>probably</em> shouldn‚Äôt do this, and would be better off making a new user in order to put all of this together. But, I like to live dangerously, and also I don‚Äôt feel like reconfiguring everything and moving stuff around.</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs whatever.</p>

<p>I consider this project one of my bigger achievements, because it took me a <em>long time</em> to get to this point. Had I more testosterone and <em>more</em> anger, building these scripts could have driven me to put a fist through a wall at times.</p>

<p>But this is one of the things I‚Äôve been wanting to do, ever since I ditched Wordpress and moved to Jekyll. Because, the way I see it, if you can think of it, <em>you can build it</em> (with Python? maybe ‚Ä¶ Rust?).</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this is useful for someone other than me, and, as a side note, if you scroll down on this website and click the DOOM Guy face, you can play a little DOOM.</p>

<p>Edit: I‚Äôve been informed that you <em>are</em> actually able to execute Python in a Github workflow bash. Queue me, tearing out all my hair. Nevertheless, this repo will remain unchanged until/if I decide to utilize this approach (which would be limited by Github‚Äôs monthly seconds, anyway).</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Scripting" /><category term="scripting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you may be asking yourself, ‚ÄúHey, didn‚Äôt you already post the code to this directly on your blog?‚Äù And the answer to that question would be, yes.
