But I know it did. I used to get home from work and spend <em>most</em> of my free time consuming another game. That was in my twenties, mostly, and also in the space of time that I was unemployed and suffering disability-levels of anxiety. But then something changed, and I became a machine.</p>

<p>Most days I come home from work, <em>now</em>, and I immediately load up VS Code and start typing. But before that it was music, and before that it was writing, and my Second Life store, or analyzing social media trying to figure out how to expand my audience. Why? Why do I now suddenly spend maybe five hours a week gaming, and the <em>rest</em> of my time just <em>making</em> things? I mean, I know why.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs partially my need, and <em>want</em>, to do something special, to do something people remember, or celebrate. But it‚Äôs also my need for self fulfillment. I used to go to work, come home, and just do whatever, and be content with that, and <em>always</em> that. But I‚Äôm not content in that anymore.</p>

<p>I went to tech school in the middle of high school to learn to code. I wanted to be a full time web developer. I wanted to be sitting at a computer, analyzing networks, building more efficient web apps, and just ‚Ä¶ basking in the code. And that was stolen from me. I don‚Äôt know if I stole it from myself, or if society pushed me into a place where I subconsciously deemed my lifelong dream career as secondary to what I needed to do in the <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Except, we‚Äôre at <em>the now</em>, and even through accomplishment, and self improvement, there‚Äôs still just <em>more struggle</em>.</p>

<p>It hardly even bothers me anymore that I might just be single the rest of my life. It bothers me <em>more</em> that I‚Äôve been doing <em>all of these things</em>, and building websites, <em>especially</em>, since 19-frikken-99, and I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ opening boxes for a retailer? I‚Äôm wearing a vest and driving into a big box store, and I‚Äôm clocking eight hours, and just going home, and thinking ‚Ä¶ is this the rest of my life?</p>

<p>I think the switch came on when I realized that it <em>wasn‚Äôt</em>.</p>

<p>And now I‚Äôm terrified of stagnation.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the post. I don‚Äôt really know how to remedy this, short of continuing to submit my resume to places hoping something sticks.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don‚Äôt know when it happened, or even how it happened.

Today I want to sort of look back over the past year, and reflect on what it‚Äôs been like to <em>mostly</em> abandon Windows (with a slight hiccup of returning for a week).</p>

<p>A lot of people panicked earlier in the year when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182350/microsoft-windows-recall-launch-on-arm" target="_blank">Microsoft unveiled its AI powered ‚Äúrecall‚Äù feature</a>, that screenshots virtually every single thing you do, and then stores it for uh ‚Ä¶ recalling later. The scary part is, or was, that you definitely <em>should not</em> trust a mega corporation with that kind of info. <em>Even if they tell you not to worry.</em></p>

<p>And many rightfully made the plunge into Linux, and stayed there.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs not why I abandoned Windows, though. I actually left Windows earlier than that, a couple months before the Recall announcement, when I decided that using a laptop for all the resource intensive things I do, ‚Ä¶ might not be a great idea sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Building a massive song in FL Studio with many, many layers can really lag out a system that isn‚Äôt up to spec.</em></p>

<p>See, I have another PC (that‚Äôs quite dusty now) that I bought in 2018, that was entirely crowdfunded, so that I could do things I need to do in order to make money (at least at the time), and it was great. It helped me out a lot and I eventually dug myself out of a hole. The thing is ‚Ä¶ Microsoft is dropping support for Windows 10, <em>next year</em>. And it pissed me off, <em>especially</em>, because the processor in that PC is <em>one generation</em> behind what Windows 11 supports. And, because of that, I would have been stuck on Windows 10, without any security updates, or substantial system updates, <em>forever</em>.</p>

<p>I ultimately decided that this was enough of an insult to literally <em>abandon Windows</em> altogether, and <em>forever</em> (seemingly).</p>

<p>You know, <em>and then</em> they announced Recall, like 2 months later. Two months after I bought a massively powerful Linux PC from <a href="https://system76.com" target="_blank">System 76</a>.</p>

<p>And for <em>months</em> I used it under their flagship operating system, Pop!_OS. I got familiar with VS Code for web development. I moved <em>all</em> of my creative work to Linux, and I even got <em>most</em> of my games that I regularly play working, just fine.</p>

<p>But, like it does with me sometimes, I got this itch. I wanted to play some Call of Duty, and I definitely don‚Äôt feel like running a console, when I have a PC with 64 gigs of ram, something like 15 cores, and 8 gigs of videoram. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.</p>

<p>So, I made a split decision, and installed Windows 11. And it was fine ‚Ä¶ for like a week.</p>

<p>But I noticed, even <em>with</em> all that power, Windows was ‚Ä¶ somehow laggy, and glitchy. Almost like my PC wasn‚Äôt <em>designed</em> for it (or maybe I forgot to download System76 drivers).</p>

<p>Either way, I said, ‚ÄúYou know what, this isn‚Äôt worth ONE game.‚Äù And I then installed one of my favorite Linux distributions, <em>Debian.</em></p>

<p>We‚Äôre almost caught up to where I am now.</p>

<p>For about two more weeks, I used Debian, and then I noticed some ‚Ä¶ weird things, such as games blowing my fans up and my PC sounding like it was taking off into space.</p>

<p>It was <em>then</em> I realized, I need to update my firmware, and have system drivers from System 76.</p>

<p>Which, unfortunately, has almost virtually <em>no</em> existing documentation for Debian.</p>

<p>Enter: Now.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm back on Pop!_OS.</p>

<p>What a journey.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pop_os/pop.png" /></p>

<p>The reason I originally <em>didn‚Äôt</em> immediately go back to Pop!_OS, was because I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶ kind of unsure of how I‚Äôll react to my Gnome desktop being replaced by whatever it is they give me with COSMIC. But, fear of change aside, this OS is actually, or has actually, <em>really</em> grown on me.</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs probably as close to Arch as I‚Äôll ever get (that‚Äôs ragebait, Pop!_OS is nothing like Arch).</p>

<p>But, having spent <em>most</em> of the year in Linux, I think I can firmly call this OS my home. It feels natural. I <em>enjoy</em> opening the terminal. I <em>like</em> writing everything in code, even if I don‚Äôt have to.</p>

<p>I am become system developer.</p>

<p>Whatever they‚Äôre constantly saying on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/" target="_blank">/r/linuxsucks</a> is at least, <em>partially</em> untrue (and also, I can‚Äôt tell if these people are serious, or shitposting constantly). It‚Äôs not as complicated as they make it seem, but it is <em>definitely</em> more challenging than choosing a Mastodon instance.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pop_os/yes.png" /></p>

<p>You don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to be a developer to use Linux, but it helps!</p>

<p>You can literally just, make a Debian bootable, or a Mint bootable, and then replace Windows, and continue using your PC like nothing happened. You don‚Äôt even <em>have</em> to interact with the terminal. You can just use the graphical package manager that‚Äôs standard on, well, at least <em>three</em> Linux distributions I‚Äôve tried (but where‚Äôs the fun in that?)</p>

<p>You can install Pop!_OS, and then Steam, and then continue your game in Dwarf Fortress just by switching on a little toggle in Steam user options that enables Proton support across <em>every game you own</em>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs really that simple.</p>

<p>Just don‚Äôt expect to play anything with kernel-level anti-cheat.</p>

<p>Which is probably actually a <em>good</em> thing. Why do game developers think they‚Äôre allowed to touch the kernel? Who the hell do you think you are? That dude from Scary Movie 2?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/pop_os/fingers.jpg" /></p>

<p>Suffice to say, I think Linux is where I‚Äôll stay. As Windows becomes more and more bloated, and far, <em>far</em> away from the nostalgia of its greatness in 1995, Linux easily takes its place.</p>

<p>Now, watch this wholesome Debian presentation I found on Youtube.</p>

Albeit, I had some <em>bad</em> experiences with some users who seem to have also been chased off of the platform for the way they treat others. But, I also have been skeptical about its mode of decentralization (where is it?), and them being VC backed, and recently funded by a crypto company. But, things are changing ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>They‚Äôre changing, because the social media landscape is changing. And I don‚Äôt mean, ‚ÄúMusk took over Twitter, so we probably have to go somewhere else‚Äù in a means of changing, but more like, ‚ÄúAll corporate social media with lax moderation methods run by billionaires is probably a good idea to flee from.‚Äù</p>

<p>And, for me, personally, looking at potentially <em>everything</em> becoming more expensive, and my bad experiences with being on Mastodon instances that aren‚Äôt <em>owned by me personally</em>, I‚Äôm looking at what I may need to do in the future.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I <em>love</em> the fediverse. But I have had to leave at least <em>five</em> different instances due to unjust banning, or extremely overzealous moderators who seek power in a digital space in order to a fill a void where they have none.</p>

<p>And for me, that‚Äôs a <em>problem.</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôm a creator, I run a website, and now I also run a server with numerous scripts that showcase what I have, and <em>can</em> do. I run a digital ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù in Second Life, and I‚Äôm working simultaneously on an album and a novel. I‚Äôm a developer, a webmaster, a writer, and a sound designer, and I <em>can‚Äôt</em> put my future, and potential future <em>career</em> in the hands of people who could silence me at a moment‚Äôs notice, just because I, for example, said ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù to a troll.</p>

<p>Yeah, I‚Äôm <em>still</em> talking about the hackers.town incident.</p>

<p>Call me jaded, but I just don‚Äôt <em>know</em> if I can trust admins of a fediverse instance to not screw me over, since this is something that has happened to me, <em>over and over</em>.</p>

<p>Now, that‚Äôs not to say Bluesky doesn‚Äôt have methods of silencing people for no reason. They have public blocklists. But! What these blocklists <em>can‚Äôt</em> do, is erase your entire online presence in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs where I find myself at a theoretical future crossroads where, suddenly, maybe I can‚Äôt pay 40 some dollars a month upkeep on my personal Mastodon instance, and I have to look at the alternatives.</p>

<p>Albeit, Wafrn, and Kitsunes.club are decent enough fediverse servers, and their admins haven‚Äôt clobbered me out of existence (which would suck, because I‚Äôm <em>also</em> a partial admin/moderator on Wafrn), for one reason or another, they just feel like an <em>extension</em> of my online identity, rather than one that‚Äôs central. This isn‚Äôt a criticism of either of these places, but more probably just <em>me</em> being ‚Ä¶ weird. I don‚Äôt know. Owning my own Mastodon instance has given me a feeling of <em>real</em> control over how people interact with, and also perceive me online. And on something like Bluesky, I can sort of also achieve that, by forwarding my domain to my username, and redirecting my little bots to separate accounts (which I‚Äôve already done).</p>

<p>The thing is, I‚Äôm probably <em>way</em> overthinking all of this, but in this bout of turmoil I‚Äôm experiencing, Bluesky <em>has</em> grown on me a bit. I‚Äôve figured out how to use ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù to create my own ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù and I‚Äôve setup some placeholder moderation lists, and it feels ‚Ä¶ okay. It could feel alright, if, for some reason, I suddenly <em>have</em> to move there.</p>

<p>But ‚Ä¶ maybe I just haven‚Äôt given Wafrn or Kitsunes enough of a chance to be central to my online identity.</p>

<p>What I <em>do</em> know, is that it‚Äôs important to have control over your identity online, and to own your voice. To give the wrong people power over you in any regard, or facet, would be a <em>mistake</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I‚Äôve had some criticisms of Bluesky, ever since it opened.

Despite all of that, today I decided to put together another pair of shorts for the set I‚Äôve been putting together for ‚Ä¶ a while. Today, it‚Äôs juicy green shorts!</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/juicy/juicy_ad.png" /></p>

<p>This is the second to last pair of shorts in the <em>Nano Nexus</em> set, and then I move on to ‚Ä¶ some other piece of clothing! And hopefully end up releasing it in a standard amount of time that is absolutely not equal to an <em>entire year</em>.</p>

<p>You can view them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-Juicy-Edition/26578153" target="_blank">digital marketplace</a>, or come and see them <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">in-world at the store</a> itself.</p>

<p>Speaking of <em>millions of other things</em> I work on, in unrelated news, I put together an RSS feed element for my website that reads my Bluesky feed, and then slapped it onto Github for others to check out and potentially use. You can see that <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/bsky-feed" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, it grabs the RSS feed of your profile (on Bluesky), bounces it off of a proxy so that it doesn‚Äôt spit out a ton of CORS errors, and then displays your most recent three posts. And, it updates with each page refresh!</p>

<p>Easy peasy.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also made it so new posts from this website <em>also</em> go to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cmdr-nova.bsky.social" target="_blank">my Bluesky account</a>, and since I haven‚Äôt really tested it yet, this post <em>should hopefully</em> get there safely. We‚Äôll see.</p>

<p>But, until my next release, or hacked code update, or random thought, have a good one!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It‚Äôs becoming kind of a trend, that I make something in my Second Life store, and then drop the whole thing for two to three months while I work on a million other things.

In my last post I talked about spending all of my free time over the course of 24 hours making a function that pushes my blog posts to Mastodon. Well, after all of that, I went to bed, woke up, and started on something new ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Almost half of my day was spent fixing and upgrading the <a class="page-link" href="/pages/haxpunks/">haxPunks</a> page on this website.</p>

<p>Basically, I noticed that the image modal was not only opening <em>within</em> its parent div (main), but also producing a scrollbar WITHIN that div, and it was very clunky and <em>bad</em> looking. So, the goal was to figure out a better way to do it. And then I stumbled into problems, where I had a position set in one of the CSS elements, and because of that <em>one freakin‚Äô thing</em>, the modal <em>would not stop</em> opening and showing on page load.</p>

<p>This <em>also</em> looked bad.</p>

<p>And it took me HOURS to notice what I did wrong.</p>

<p>But I fixed it.</p>

<p>And I got the modal functioning correctly.</p>

<p>And I formatted it to work nicely on mobile (I think).</p>

<p>Then, it was <em>done</em>.</p>

<p>After that, I took a look at what is now the <a class="page-link" href="/pages/second-life/">Second Life</a> page, and decided to delete everything I‚Äôd written in there, and made something new. It showcases my store, and then my land. No big story about where I came from, where I‚Äôm going, how things went wrong, and where we‚Äôre at now.</p>

<p>Just the stuff that currently exists. Which is good, I think. So people don‚Äôt have to read a history book about why I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve done, and what my goals are.</p>

<p>But I wasn‚Äôt finished after that. I <em>needed</em> to do more.</p>

<p>I took to Gimp, opened OBS, and recorded my process of making a haxPunk, and then uploaded the video, plus the result (to the haxPunks page). Yes, you will notice in the video there‚Äôs a ‚Äúgenerative‚Äù layer, and that‚Äôs entirely because this is a PSD from when I was still subscribed to Photoshop, and <em>totally</em> innocently looking at what exactly the feature did (lol).</p>

<p>But, here‚Äôs that video:</p>

<iframe title="Making Pixels / haxPunks 27" width="560" height="315" src="https://video.infosec.exchange/videos/embed/b8f4feab-2a80-4697-af20-a4b73a62f1f6" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms"></iframe>

<p>And here‚Äôs the punk:</p>

<p><img src="/img/haxpunks/haxPunks_0027.png" /></p>

<p>As you can probably tell, I‚Äôve modeled this one after the current version of my Second Life avatar, and I think it turned out pretty neat.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been making these things since <em>before</em> I said, ‚ÄúWait a minute, NFTs are stupid.‚Äù But the thing is, I <em>enjoyed</em> the process of making them so much, that even <em>after</em> exiting the whole ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù thing, I wanted to keep making them. I‚Äôve had these going for a <em>long</em> time, and I want to make <em>hundreds</em> of them. Just for fun.</p>

<p>Lately, that‚Äôs pretty much the reason I do <em>most</em> things. On my website, on Github, or through Python on my VPS. I just enjoy doing this stuff!</p>

<p>If at some point I happen to get paid to do any of it, hey, that‚Äôs awesome (please pay me to do these things at some point oh my god please).</p>

Earlier in the week, I suddenly had an issue where I broke my RSS feed bot that posted new feed items from my blog to my Mastodon account. I described this in my last post, but it was entirely because I ‚Ä¶ edited the XML. So! I spent the last entire day rebuilding a brand new way to do this. By turning VS Code‚Äôs ‚Äúcommit‚Äù button into a ‚ÄúPost to Mastodon‚Äù button. Let me explain.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been using ‚ÄúDeploy to Neocities‚Äù for a while, so I had a basis to work with already. I figured, all I‚Äôd have to do ‚Ä¶ is tell Github to build the site, and then construct the URL from what it would usually be on my website.</p>

<p>The next thing I had to make it do, was SSH into my VPS, because you can‚Äôt run Python on Neocities.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to work with a custom Ruby plugin, and have <em>that</em> build the post content, and then send it along with the constructed URL to a Python script on my VPS that would then jumble it all together and post it. But that didn‚Äôt work. Because Jekyll apparently does not like custom Rubies ‚Ä¶ I guess?</p>

<p>Also, if that sounds really convoluted and a round-a-about way of doing things, that‚Äôs <em>because it is</em>.</p>

<p>So, I went to sleep, then I went to work. And I mulled it over in my head, ‚ÄúWhy not just have the build process construct the URL, look for new posts, and then dump it into the pipeline to your server, where it‚Äôs constructed, and posted.‚Äù</p>

<p>As you can see, all sensitive information is being stored, <em>somewhere else</em>. In Github secrets! Which are injected into the Python script upon connection.</p>

<p>But, what this does, is it basically creates this situation where, now, my blog is kind of, sort of, federated? Not really, but it <em>acts</em> that way. Whenever I write a new post, and hit commit, the site builds, and then my account posts the generated matter. It‚Äôs as if my Mastodon account is now inside of VS Code. Which it totally could be! ‚Ä¶ if I wanted to post everything I write to Mastodon in links to my blog.</p>

<p>I lost a little sleep over this. I went to bed late last night, and then I woke up early to do more troubleshooting, and then I went to work with bags under my eyes, and then I came home, tired as all hell. And I kept going.</p>

<p>And now it‚Äôs done</p>

<p>It works.</p>

Which ‚Ä¶ I accomplished, pretty easily! But then my bot that‚Äôs supposed to read my feed, and append old items to a file, and <em>only</em> post brand new items, exploded onto Mastodon three times with everything I‚Äôve ever posted on here.</p>

<p>I think I could troubleshoot the issue and fix it, but at this point I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a great idea. But hey! My feed looks REALLY COOL.</p>

<p><a href="https://nova.mkultra.monster/feed.xml">Nova Feed</a></p>

<p>Aside from dropping everything I‚Äôve mostly ever written online, directly onto Mastodon, I also made some updates to the site.</p>

<p>I was struggling with the CORS proxy for about 10 hours, with a break for sleep in-between, and I finally figured it out. Now the Tumblr feed of my bot posting on the left sidebar is working correctly, <em>and</em> updating without the need for the site to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve also added something pretty neat to the right sidebar, directly under my haxPunks ‚Ä¶ A list of trending topics from Mastodon! Which, when you click on a topic, you can then view who‚Äôs posting about and within that hashtag via your own Mastodon instance.</p>

<p>I may not really be able to figure out how to turn a Jekyll site into something that‚Äôs fully federated, but I can make it look like it is!</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, everything is setup correctly. I have a proxy server running perfectly, and certificates, and nginx blasting on all fours. But then I load the website, I check the developer console and ‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>YOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED BY CORS, WHERE THE HEADERS MAN?</strong></p>

<p>There‚Äôs probably a very simple solution, and maybe it‚Äôs because I was running a local copy of my website alongside the live version and maybe that was making CORS go ‚ÄúDUDE,‚Äù but I think I‚Äôll figure that out later.</p>

<p>My first objective, was to see if I could fully automate my dead Twitter account to just post stuff with a script utilizing the free API tier that they offer for personal use. After <em>much</em> hacking around, and finding out that it‚Äôs mostly restrictive, and using multiple version of OAuth, I decided it‚Äôs not worth it. Not worth it to figure out, and not worth it to maintain for a website that‚Äôll probably be dead in like six months.</p>

<p>Then, I moved on to Threads. Surely they have an API that can just toss me some keys and let me use Python to post a bunch of random stuff to my timeline so that I can further automate what I‚Äôm posting and doing on corporate owned social media.</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>Or, at least, I haven‚Äôt quite figured it out, because it‚Äôs about as complicated as the Twitter API.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs in the garbage for now as well.</p>

<p>But then, I was on my Mastodon instance, and I realized, ‚ÄúHey, that reddit bot script I wrote repeats itself a lot. I think it‚Äôd do better to choose from <em>any</em> images posted to my fave subreddits, and maybe also like ‚Ä¶ keep a log file of what‚Äôs already been posted? So it stops posting the same things on a daily basis?‚Äù</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs what I did.</p>

<p>I massively simplified the code, and set it up so that it keeps a log file.</p>

<p>First, we import all the stuff we need
<code>
import os
import random
import json
import requests
import praw
from PIL import Image
from mastodon import Mastodon
import pytumblr
import tempfile
</code></p>

<p>We wanna use ‚Äúrandom‚Äù to select random images, json to save the URLs for <em>already posted</em> images to a file in order to reference later, pillow to optimize the images so that it isn‚Äôt all crappily crap once posted to Mastodon and Tumblr, and of course all the other essentials needed to make this work (like pytumblr and mastodon, gotta have those if we want to post).</p>

<p>Then we slap on some configuration. As far as API keys go, <em>you need them all</em>.</p>

<p><code>
 &#35; Configuration
SUBREDDITS = ['Animewallpaper', 'ZeroTwo', 'BlueArchive', 'ZenlessZoneZero', 'Edgerunners', 'BaldursGate3', 'BokuNoHeroAcademia', 'ChainsawMan', 'backrooms', 'AnimeGirls', 'animeART', 'liminalspace', 'evangelion', 'abandonwareDOS', 'himikotoga', 'SFWmonstergirls', 'MotokoKusanagi', 'Churchofzerotwo', 'ChurchofMarnie', 'PokeGals', 'CuteAnimeGirls', 'UnixPorn', 'RebeccasPlace', 'AnimeSketch']
LOG_FILE = 'posted_images.json'
IMAGE_LIMIT = 50
MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL = 'https://your_instace.url'
MASTODON_CLIENT_ID = 'mastodon_client_id'
MASTODON_CLIENT_SECRET = 'client_secret_masto'
MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'masto_access_token'
TUMBLR_CONSUMER_KEY = 'consumer_key_from_tumblr_app'
TUMBLR_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'the_consumer_secret'
TUMBLR_OAUTH_TOKEN = 'the_oauth_token_you_generate'
TUMBLR_OAUTH_SECRET = 'the_oauth_secret_key'
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = 'reddit_client_id'
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET = 'reddit_client_secret'
REDDIT_USER_AGENT = 'name_of_the_reddit_app'
CUSTOM_TEXT = "Some custom text to post along with each that goes out to Mastodon and Tumblr"
TUMBLR_BLOG_NAME = 'nova-ayashi' &#35; This is where the name of your Tumblr blog goes
</code></p>

<p>As you can see, this is where we want to list our favorite subreddits, then tell it what the log file to generate should be called, and how many images it should look at at once. We don‚Äôt want to set it much higher than 50 because you‚Äôre going to DDOS your own damn self and probably hit a rate limit somewhere.</p>

<p>After you‚Äôve decided what to input in <em>those</em> fields, you‚Äôre going to want to go through the lengthy process of obtaining your Mastodon keys, creating a Reddit app (for personal use, so they don‚Äôt charge you money), and then the Tumblr app. Generating the Tumblr OAuth keys can be done within VS Code, just use localhost as your redirect URI.</p>

<p>Next, we want to load any posted images, <em>if there are any</em>.</p>

<p><code>
def load_posted_images():
    if os.path.exists(LOG_FILE):
        with open(LOG_FILE, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return []
</code></p>

<p>Then create the posted images json.</p>

<p><code>
def save_posted_image(image_url):
    posted_images = load_posted_images()
    posted_images.append(image_url)
    with open(LOG_FILE, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(posted_images, f)
</code></p>

<p>Now, look at a random subreddit from your list! ü§©</p>

<p><code>
def get_random_subreddit():
    return random.choice(SUBREDDITS)
</code></p>

<p>And make sure it gets a nice high resolution image so that it doesn‚Äôt post some pixelated looking poop.</p>

<p><code>
def get_high_res_image_url(submission):
    if submission.url.endswith(('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png')):
        return submission.url
    if hasattr(submission, 'preview'):
        images = submission.preview.get('images', [])
        if images:
            resolutions = images[0].get('resolutions', [])
            if resolutions:
                return resolutions[-1]['url']
    return None
</code></p>

<p>Now, here comes the fun part. We‚Äôre going to take the random subreddit we just chose earlier, and we‚Äôre going to tell the script to retry if it doesn‚Äôt find anything, and when it does, append the URL to the json so that it‚Äôs permanently saved as something that‚Äôs already been posted. I had this issue before where the script kept repeating itself over and over again, essentially spamming timelines with duplicate content.</p>

<p><code>
def get_random_photo_from_subreddit(reddit, subreddit_name):
    subreddit = reddit.subreddit(subreddit_name)
    image_submissions = [submission for submission in subreddit.new(limit=IMAGE_LIMIT) if submission.url.endswith(('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png'))]
</code>
<code>
    if not image_submissions:
        return get_random_photo_from_subreddit(reddit, subreddit_name)  # retry
    else:
        posted_images = load_posted_images()
        random_submission = random.choice(image_submissions)
        image_url = get_high_res_image_url(random_submission)
</code>
<code>
        while image_url in posted_images:
            random_submission = random.choice(image_submissions)
            image_url = get_high_res_image_url(random_submission)
</code>
<code>        
        save_posted_image(image_url)
        return random_submission, image_url
</code></p>

<p>Once the script has chosen an image, we want to save it to the server. Just because we feel like it, f#ck it.</p>

<p><code>
def download_and_optimize_image(image_url):
    response = requests.get(image_url)
    temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.jpg')
    temp_file.write(response.content)
    temp_file.close()
</code>
<code>
    image = Image.open(temp_file.name)
    image = image.convert('RGB')
    image.save(temp_file.name, optimize=True, quality=85)
    return temp_file.name
</code></p>

<p>And already, we‚Äôre posting! For Mastodon, we‚Äôre going to use a sensitive marker so that we don‚Äôt hit everyone in the face with something that could be potentially distressing or lewd. This is <em>Reddit</em> we‚Äôre pulling from, after-all.</p>

<p><code>
def post_to_mastodon(mastodon_client, image_path, status_text):
    media = mastodon_client.media_post(image_path)
    mastodon_client.status_post(status_text, media_ids=[media], sensitive=True)
</code></p>

<p>Once the fediverse has been graced by anime pythons, we‚Äôre going to hit Tumblr next. Except for Tumblr, we‚Äôre going to use the subreddit name as a hashtag so that it‚Äôs categorized and easier to find, since Tumblr still heavily uses hashtags.</p>

<p><code>
def post_to_tumblr(tumblr_client, image_path, status_text, tags):
    tumblr_client.create_photo(TUMBLR_BLOG_NAME, state="published", tags=tags, data=image_path, caption=status_text)
</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Note: I do not endorse Photo Matt and his crusade against his own company and software, nor do I endorse transphobia he expressed earlier in 2024.</em></strong></p>

<p>In order to make sure everything does what it‚Äôs <em>supposed</em> to do, we need to define the main function. This is where we check all the API keys and what-not, optimize the image, and tell the script what exactly it is we want to say along with the image that‚Äôs being posted (aside from the custom text already defined in the configuration). Once all that‚Äôs done, we need to make sure we delete that image from the server, because we definitely don‚Äôt want to have 40,000 anime girl images eating your hdd space.</p>

<p>The reason we have Mastodon and Tumblr in separate functions is because they have different requirements for formatting posts. Mastodon supports markdown, while Tumblr operates on basic HTML in its posts. If we send the Mastodon version of the post text to Tumblr, you‚Äôll get a non-formatted mess that sucks to look at and has no linking. So, what we do instead, is define two different types of posts!</p>

<p>Now we just make sure that it only runs when the file is executed.</p>

<p><code>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></p>

<p>And that‚Äôs that! I remember when I used to be a heavy-gamer. Playing Call of Duty and World of Warcraft for 14 hours at a time and then going to work on an hour and a half of sleep. But, no more! Now I stare at text on my computer screen and grow ever-more-blind in a pair of glasses that probably need their prescription updated. No matter. I hope this script is useful to others, rather than just me, with a special interest in flooding social media with Python experiments.</p>

<p>The reason I‚Äôve decided to post the code here, rather than Github, is because I thought it‚Äôd be more fun to break it all down and talk about it. There doesn‚Äôt really seem to be a whole lot of conversation that happens on Github, and pretty much almost nobody even follows me there. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>

<p>Either way ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, like you do, I got home from work, and immediately dove back into the code machine, i.e., my monstrous PC that I primarily use for writing website stuff, or python scripts, and sometimes playing Dragon Age and Baldur‚Äôs Gate.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Playing With JavaScript</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/programming/2024/11/02/inplaying-with-javascript.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Playing With JavaScript" /><published>2024-11-02T20:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-11-02T20:30:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/programming/2024/11/02/inplaying-with-javascript</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/programming/2024/11/02/inplaying-with-javascript.html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I got off of work, sat down on my couch, and promptly passed the <em>heck</em> out. Then, I woke up, and ate an italian sub. This was just enough fuel for me to load up VS Code and get back to messing with my website. As you can probably see, if you‚Äôre reading this from the page itself, I‚Äôve made some ‚Ä¶ <em>upgrades</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/playingwithjava/upgrades.gif" /></p>

<p>Obviously, I already detail some of what I do in my changelog, in regards to major changes, but I wanted to write up a post about it, because this site is making huge leaps in progress (ever since I redesigned the CSS in order to make this place much more responsive to various screens that people use). And, for being a completely static site built on the Jekyll foundation, you can hardly even tell that‚Äôs what it is.</p>

<p>Firstly, if you look to the right, you‚Äôll see the Mastodon feed. For the longest time, this was just disjointed text with separators. You could only tell that it was coming from my Mastodon posts, because I had some text that said ‚Äúmkultra feed‚Äù up above it. Despite how much I appreciate the original author of the script, I‚Äôve been wanting to alter it so that it‚Äôs <em>much more obvious</em> it‚Äôs coming from Mastodon, or a social media website, in-general.</p>

<p>So, I did.</p>

<p><strong><em>I would upload this to GitHub, but I don‚Äôt remember who the author was, and I don‚Äôt want to just upload a modified version of their script without asking first.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, you‚Äôll see that my actual Mastodon account information is linked to each post, as it updates live! If you click on the post date, this will then take you to the actual post itself, on my instance.</p>

<p>Secondly, I have a calendar on the right side of the page further down below this Mastodon feed. I mostly added this for flavor, because I noticed some sites in the indie web and Neocities sphere had little calendars, and rather than steal one, I decided to make one myself. But, in order to make it <em>unique</em>, and fun, I wanted to add some additional flavor to that as well.</p>

<p>It had some issues at first, but I‚Äôve managed to setup some JavaScript in order to pull random top 100 images from the subreddit ‚Äú/r/animewallpaper‚Äù in order to show a random image in the background, upon load. This is, semi, sort of using the Reddit API. And no, I‚Äôm not paying them a single dime in order to make this happen.</p>

<p>Next, as most who keep up with my blog will know, I‚Äôve written python scripts that do numerous things. Such as pulling the top 5 trending posts from specific subreddits, and sending me an email of what‚Äôs trending, each morning. Another script that generates random text and then posts to Mastodon, based on a database of my own Mastodon posts backed up from the start of 2024, to now. And then, of course, we have my reddit-bot script that pulls from a list of my favorite subreddits and posts a random trending image to both Mastodon, and Tumblr.</p>

<p>In order to integrate this into my webpage, so that my work has some kind of permanence outside of social networks where it may not be as easily seen, I‚Äôve written some JavaScript that utilizes Tumblr API to create a live feed of the posts that reddit-bot makes specifically to my Tumblr account (because that‚Äôs mostly the only thing I use it for nowadays, and it didn‚Äôt make sense to me to put multiple Mastodon account feeds on my site). You can see, over on the left side of the page, that it displays the <em>exact</em> text that‚Äôs posted to Tumblr whenever the bot makes its call, with images in-tact.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is a change many may not <em>ever</em> notice. I‚Äôve written a modal that is used specifically and <em>only</em> on my <a class="page-link" href="/pages/haxpunks/">haxPunks page</a>. If you haven‚Äôt ever visited it, basically, back in 2022 I was making NFTs, and it made me a little money ‚Ä¶ <em>it‚Äôs why I have some of the tech that I currently do</em>. Despite all that money being gone, it helped me <em>a lot</em> in a period of my life where I was recovering from semi-self isolation that I put myself through for years. And, even though I‚Äôve mostly stepped away from NFTs due to the volatile and toxic nature of the subculture, I still make little pixel people here and there when I feel like it (completely disconnected from the world of NFTs, despite them existing on the OpenSea blockchain).</p>

<p>But, I wanted the page to be more dynamic and fun to look at.</p>

<p>This modal makes it so that when you click an image of one of the pixel-people I‚Äôve drawn, it blows it up on the screen without ever leaving the page, and gives you not only a better look, but also a description that‚Äôs derived from the alt text (I‚Äôm still working on writing a description for all of them, so upon posting this, only Charlotte with have a description).</p>

<p>That‚Äôs <em>most</em> of what I‚Äôve done today, but I can still feel the itch to do even more. What that ‚Äúmore‚Äù entails, is entirely up to what my brain decides, whenever it comes to me.</p>

<p>But hey, thanks for reading!</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I got off of work, sat down on my couch, and promptly passed the heck out.
