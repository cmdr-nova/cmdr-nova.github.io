So much so, trolls have had a laugh at my expense because of it, because, as <em>we all know</em>, Windows is totally superior, with its built-in ads, built-in AI, built-in (or soon to be) digital snoop, built-in forcing you to use Edge and making it so even if you use a different browser you have to tick a thousand boxes that say “open [file extension] in my new browser, instead.” And then there’s MacOS, which I <em>also</em> use, because I have a Macbook, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch, and the entire Homekit thing with the yellow ball that speaks words to me if I say “Hey Siri, what’s it like outside right now?” Which is fine! Because MacOS is <em>also</em> Unix.</p>

<p>It’s a purely <em>locked down</em> and extremely secure version of Unix, so-much-so that if you try and watch <em>any</em> streaming app on an external monitor through MacOS, the whole screen goes blank.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I wanted to write a plea to Apple, because they <em>definitely</em> read my blog (see: sarcasm), because, it’s almost 2025. No average person is pirating anything anymore. I’m pretty sure most gen z and alpha kids/adults have no idea what the phrase “pirating a movie” even means. <em>Nobody is recording shows and movies through a capture device on a secondary monitor</em>. So, can we please, let me watch Apple TV on my second, much larger monitor? I <em>pay you</em> to be able to watch Severance. The least you could do is <em>let me watch it on my big honkin’ monitor</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, I could turn on my Apple TV box but that takes WORK. I gotta use my CONTROLLER. I gotta switch the inputs.</p>

<p>Anyway, though, why use <em>both</em> Linux and MacOS?</p>

<p>Linux is great for pretty much a lot of things. Notice, I didn’t say <em>everything</em>. I like it for security and data ownership. I like it for all of the things I can do with it, that it absolutely won’t stop me from doing. I like it because my Linux PC is a beef-master 5000 and I can play Diablo 4 at max FPS (which is about the only game I play nowadays).</p>

<p>But, because I have all these millions of Apple devices, turning on my laptop and plugging into my larger display allows me to write while listening to my Apple music library that isn’t being displayed through a built-in web UI (I’m talking about the flatpaks via Linux). I can see all my texts coming through on my desktop, work on writing my book in the Pages app I’ve been using for over a year, and I can use Affinity!</p>

<p>I dumped Photoshop a long time ago, after they went face-first into AI, and started up with the predatory subscriptions. And Affinity is probably the <em>greatest</em> alternative.</p>

<p>But there’s no Linux port. And a dev told me directly they have <em>no plans to support Linux</em>.</p>

<p>Which is a huge bummer. In fact, it’s kind of … dumb. I almost swore off their entire software suite, because <em>you’ve already developed this software for MacOS,</em> which is a variation of UNIX!</p>

<p>Regardless …</p>

<p>If I somehow blew your mind that MacOS is in fact Unix based, and you don’t believe me, open up Terminal on your Mac. Create a simple bash script. I dunno, something that says “Hello world!” To do this, type “nano hello.sh”, and within that new file, type in “#!/bin/bash”, and then press enter. Now type “echo “Hello world!” Now, press ctrl + O, and then ctrl + X. Lastly, type in chmod +x hello.sh (or whatever you name your bash script). Now! Run it! Type in “./hello.sh”</p>

<p>And voila.</p>

<p>All of the things you just did are exactly how you’d accomplish the same thing in Linux. You probably thought, “Wait, what the heck? Nano is included in MacOS?”</p>

<p>Yup.</p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to the world of only Unix based machines.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Computing" /><category term="linux" /><category term="mac" /><category term="computing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a real big into Linux kinda person.

But, Bluesky was an unwelcoming hellscape when it required invite codes to join, and it’s <em>still exactly that</em>, except now it has millions of people on it. Of course, there’s the drama surrounding Jesse Singal’s presence on the network, and some trans woman who made a bot that made a trust and safety team member’s porn likes full-public-facing, but this isn’t really about that. At least not right now.</p>

<p>I’m going to be fully transparent, again, like I always am: I came out as trans in 2012, and I began transition in that same year. Things were rough, because I was at this pivotal position in life where I didn’t know who I wanted to be, and I didn’t know <em>who I was</em>, and I was suffering from anxiety <em>already</em>, before I jumped in. I made mistakes with my family, and things got dark for a while (they aren’t anymore). I lost my job because of harassment I had been enduring, and HR’s inability to take any action whatsoever. It transformed me into someone with crippling anxiety, and that of a person who <em>could not function</em> in public.</p>

<p>My first interactions with the trans community were on Reddit, where people posted photos of their faces and asked how well they “pass,” and people would routinely tear others down and talk about things that are either very hard to change, or can’t change at all. I had people telling me they liked my face before transition more than in the midst of it, and all of these experiences kind of setup my mindset for the following five years that went by (including the stalker I gained from the aforementioned subreddits).</p>

<p>I didn’t, and <em>never had</em> any community offline. Every trans woman I came into contact with in offline spaces ended up causing me some kind of pain, or heartbreak, for whatever reason. A girl in Philadelphia who used me for a day as a ride around town while she spouted off racist remarks about random people passing us by. A girl in West Virginia who is, coincidentally, also currently posting on Bluesky, who used me to make her ex girlfriend jealous, and then viciously abused me by pretending to attempt to take her own life over the phone, <em>to me</em>. Another who was a locksmith at the time, who I saw on and off for over a year, who ended our time together by telling me that I wasn’t “dating material.” After, again, <em>well over a year</em>.</p>

<p>I met someone I knew from Twitter for coffee, and she proceeded to never speak to me again, afterward, only because, I’m assuming, I didn’t ask to see her again.</p>

<p>And then there was the detransed person I knew from my job at the time, who was <em>one of the most horrible people</em> I’ve ever known, and had the displeasure of interacting with.</p>

<p>It’s safe to say, there’s no such thing as community offline. Or, at least, <em>there never was</em>.</p>

<p>Online, it wasn’t much better.</p>

<p>I came into contact with Laurelai Bailey, and in my extremely vulnerable state, I was manipulated, and then held emotionally and psychologically hostage for <em>years</em>, and I think this was a major contributor to my inability to ever <em>belong</em> to a community of any sort (Bailey has an extremely long paper-trail of being a social parasite online, among other things. Such as a rapist, and an FBI snitch).</p>

<p>I tried to find community on Tumblr, which didn’t happen, because Tumblr is <em>very bad</em> at actually connecting people together who have the same interests, and there were more bigots on Tumblr, than anything. I tried to find community on Twitter, and found endless toxic popularity contests and mean-girling. I tried to find community on Mastodon, and in my constant turmoil, I was banned, and then banned again (kitty.town), and then banned again (deadinsi.de), and then banned again (cybre.space)–Every single time someone decided to troll me, or attack me for my views, or how I looked, or what-have-you. I do not have good experiences with third-party fedi admins. Which is why I now run my own instance (tech bros who run instances routinely villianize those who are being attacked, rather than villainize the people <em>doing</em> the attacking).</p>

<p>I became part of the Twitter synthwave scene, and found <em>some</em> kind of community, albeit, it wasn’t a <em>trans community</em>. It was mostly men, who, years after, I realize were only tolerating my presence. Suffice to say, despite having a bestselling dark-synth album, I was ejected from that community after <em>exactly one</em> complaint against a transphobic comment, to the response of hundreds of people within Twitter-synthwave dogpiling and harassing me. I was muted and blocked by streaming radio stations, and my label (at the time), seemingly vanished from the internet completely. Then I was, again, on my own.</p>

<p>This kind of coincides, or leads up to me being banned from hackers.town on Mastodon, but that was more of the same in regards to what I’ve already mentioned: Tech bros and their sycophants, with backwards ideologies in regards to harassers and victims.</p>

<p>And you might be asking yourself at this point, “What’s this got to do with Bluesky?”</p>

<p>You see, I have to give some backstory here (and there is <em>so much more</em> to it than this), because it won’t make sense if I don’t.</p>

<p>I joined Bluesky over a year ago (as of posting this), because I finally got an invite code, and despite putting my transition on pause (which I could probably argue is more to do with severe anxiety and fear than anything else), I <em>still</em> wanted to find <strong>community</strong>. Which, at this point, I’m almost certain does not exist, <em>anywhere</em>. But, the problem with Bluesky, is that it has attracted all of the people who made Twitter shitty back in 2014: Harassers, narcissists, and self-described “mean girls.”</p>

<p>I recall a block list operator on Bluesky (who eventually got pushed off of the platform) who posted along with someone at the bsky domain “benni.gay” or something? And this Bennie, was, or <em>still is</em>, one of those strange people who not only identify with violent slurs, but regularly post them. We’re talking about “tranny” here. And me, with all of this disgusting backstory of nonstop bullshit, comes into contact with this person, and <em>of course</em> my reaction was, “Hey can you <em>not</em> do that.”</p>

<p>And, you know, since, <em>apparently</em> new-gen trans people have decided that slurs <em>aren’t</em> slurs, and I <em>still</em> get much, <em>much</em> younger trans women <em>on Bluesky</em> questioning me like, “What do you mean <strong>tranny</strong> is a slur?” I can only assume that there is an extreme lack of education in these faux online communities. But!</p>

<p>I questioned this person, and before tossing her a mute, I felt it was courtesy to at least ask or say, “Can we not post these kinds of words without a warning of some sort?”</p>

<p>You know what happened next. You already know.</p>

<p>Dogpiling, harassment, vicious narcissism, and violent denial of lived experience.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I <em>originally</em> deleted my account because of this, and joined Threads for a while, to begin normal-posting. And then, after a while, I launched my own Mastodon instance, and herein began where we are today, a year later.</p>

<p>But, you see, Bluesky has been gaining popularity, so … why not try again?</p>

<p>Oh, well, okay. So that was a bad idea.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bsky-again-times-two/ugh.png" /></p>

<p>And you can probably already guess, this lead to … harassment! Dogpiling! And eventual block-listing!</p>

<p>Maybe there’s something wrong <em>with me</em>. Maybe I’m too chill, or I give people too much benefit of the doubt. Maybe I’m emotionally non-existent, <em>because</em> of my history, and therefore can’t really see this coming anymore. Or, maybe online communities, especially and specifically those revolving around trans communities, <em>aren’t good and are very bad, actually</em>.</p>

<p>To be part of one of these communities, you have to subject yourself to bad jokes, labeling yourself with slurs that violent attackers <em>have actually used against you</em>, right before attempting to snatch you out of the driver side seat of your car (this happened, to me), and all-around act like a petulant, vapid psychopath, with no morals, or qualms with anything <em>unless it affects you directly</em>.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas, mother-freakers.</p>

<p>I stay on Mastodon, despite the numerous failures of admins across different instances, because it’s an online experience that I can <em>completely control</em>, while running my own instance, and <em>own</em> community. And even if nobody ever joins mkultra.monster, at least I can’t be ejected from my own platform for having the audacity to have feelings about things, and morals.</p>

<p>But I do think, at this point, Bluesky is beyond a failed experiment, because all it does is emulate the worst parts of Twitter, before Twitter became <em>only the worst parts</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="toxicity" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I didn’t post about this when it happened, because, honestly, I’m unsure how much attention I want to give toxic people, and, after so many years of this being routine from people with Main Character Syndrome (see: narcissism) on social media, it’s tiring.

<p>I’m fairly confident that I can share snippets of things on Mastodon, and not worry all that much about my work being vacuumed up by a machine for use in some soulless idiot’s money-making scheme, but where else can you go? Forums are probably a no, and <a href="https://lemmy.zip/post/22031416" target="_blank">even NaNoWriMo are now AI shills</a>.</p>

<p>And that’s the <em>problem.</em> I nearly entirely gave up writing fiction, the second I found out that these machines were going online to scrape the whole internet for the sole purpose of profiting off of other people’s work. I mean, how do you respond to that, as someone who <em>makes</em> things, with <em>your own hands?</em></p>

<p>Frankly, I responded by saying, “Well screw it, I’m not doing <em>anything</em> then.”</p>

Destroyed, as in, as soon as you launch it, it closes itself. But, there’s a work-around …</p>

<p>The issue, is that, apparently, in the latest update a few days ago, due to <a href="https://jira.firestormviewer.org/browse/FIRE-34877" target="_blank">recent changes with regard to Mesa drivers</a>, Firestorm no longer works. There <em>is</em> a fix on the way, but, as we know, these fixes could take … any infinitely guessable amount of time to hit your machine. It could be tomorrow, it could be in 3 weeks, it could be in 3 months. Who knows! I’m personally running Pop!_OS, and my Firestorm updates come, <em>sometimes</em>, weeks after they’ve been released.</p>

<p>As someone who is running multiple stores in Second Life, and has some other things I need to look after on a daily basis, this is no bueno.</p>

<p>But, also, if you’re on Linux, you might like to game? You might dabble in a little pew pew, and a little fictional love triangle? Well, do I have news for you.</p>

<p>Open up Lutris. If you don’t have it, <em>get it</em>. Use Flatseal to make sure it has access to all of your drives (just in case you don’t want to install things to your main hdd). Search for Firestorm, install that motherfreaker. Boom.</p>

<p>Launch it.</p>

<p>You’re back in Second Life.</p>

<p>For now.</p>

<p>Until the Mesa, or Firestorm devs break <em>something else</em>.</p>

<p>I figured I would share this, though, because the amount of Linux users out there are growing. Growing, as Microsoft continues to transform Windows into a vehicle for malware and spam.</p>

<p>I was willing to give up Call of Duty to use Linux, due to their kernel level anti-cheat, that should, frankly, be <em>illegal</em>.

And the same is true for the social media app that calls itself “decentralized” while not being decentralized whatsoever.</p>

<p>Giving users keys they can host on a VPS that open up a connection to your server farm is not what decentralization is.</p>

<p>But anyway …</p>

<p>Over the past week, Bluesky has managed to utterly destroy user trust in a period of time that’s even faster than Mozilla’s destruction of trust. A week ago, people were praising Bluesky as a safe alternative to Twitter that won’t host or embolden neo nazis. Now, bsky has become a haven for Jesse Singal, a dangerous troll who has lawyers.</p>

<p>Lawyers who are apparently requesting private information of users from Bluesky, and are being obliged???</p>

<p>This is what we call a Guinness Book of World Records attempt at enshitification.</p>

<p>I tried to find the official stance on all this, though, but it seems sources directly <em>from</em> Bluesky devs / moderators have either been deleted, or hidden. So, a lot of this probably sounds like hearsay, and the only thing I can really show is <a href="https://hexbear.net/post/4100941" target="_blank">this post from hexbear</a>.</p>

<p>But, <em>if this is true even in the slightest</em>, you should leave Bluesky, immediately.</p>

<p>You should leave Bluesky, and just … find a decent Mastodon instance. Which isn’t hard. I’ve written so many little guides on how to determine if an instance is good or bad, and I really have to reiterate, that while ActivityPub has its issues, it definitely doesn’t have a problem with moderation (as long as you don’t join a lawless instance, and I have to repeat, do not do that).

<p>And that’s how <em>all</em> instances technically work!</p>

<p>Now, I know not everyone in the world reads this blog, so these things I keep saying for sure aren’t reaching masses of people. But I post these things so that maybe they’ll be found in the future when people are looking for answers, or alternatives.</p>

<p>And I realize that some may return to Twitter, some may jump over to Threads, or <em>return</em> to Threads, and ActivityPub <em>may</em> experience another influx.</p>

<p>But if you were thinking, “Huh, Bluesky? Must be too good to be true.” Well, <em>it is</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The thing about centralized social media, and this is in direct reference of Bluesky, both because that’s what it is, and because I’d like to spite the devs, is that all centralized social media eventually turns to garbage.

That the team behind the app sort of leaves it <em>mostly</em> in the hands of the users to construct block and mute lists (which comes with accountability issues all on its own). But, one would only have to take a gander at the <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=jesse+singal" target="_blank">current Bluesky search results for Jesse Singal’s account</a> on the app, to see where some of this frustration might be coming from.</p>

<p>So, in response, I offer the alternative of Mastodon / ActivityPub again! Despite the random negative-posting I’ve seen on Bluesky <em>about</em> Mastodon (people don’t like aspects of the UI and join process), I really think people should check it out. Do some research. Find a community that <em>has</em> rules and guidelines. If you do this, I think you’ll be just fine.</p>

<p>Do you know how much bigotry and toxicity I see on my own instance?</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because I ban every single thing that even so much as slightly annoys me (ban, as in suspending from federation, i.e., making them invisible to my entire server).</p>

<p>If you’d like to give it a try, I have open registration on my instance at <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a>, and while I can’t sustain thousands of people, I can at least take in <em>some</em>. For MKMO, you only need provide a clear reason why you want to join (this is to weed out trolls), and give me some time to approve your account.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there are <em>plenty</em> other instances to look at, too. I suggest giving my page on <a class="page-link" href="/pages/activitypub">ActivityPub</a> a look, and then also the <a href="https://jointhefediverse.net" target="_blank">Join the Fediverse</a> website.</p>

<p>That’s all for now! I have to get ready for work soon, but I wanted to put this out there for those who may be interested in a <em>real</em> alternative to corporate-controlled, poorly moderated social media.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="mastodon" /><category term="bluesky" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="activitypub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m seeing murmurs that people, at least some people, are becoming fed up with the low amount to entire lack of moderation on Bluesky.

Influencers on social media flaunting expensive cars, designer clothing, big houses (so you wanna be a rock superstar), and then, of course, the extremely lucky Youtubers, TikTokers, and so on and so forth, who make it big because they hit the algorithm correctly. But, in all reality, this is a small amount of people who do these things. Becoming rich and famous is not something the average person, or most people, will ever attain. It’s like they say, you have more in common with a homeless person, than a billionaire.</p>

<p>And that’s true.</p>

<p>I’ve been “making content,” all sorts of things, for as long as I can remember now. I hit it very minimally “big” in 2022 with some NFT project I was drawing by hand, and then I lost all of it within 6 months. Albeit, it was only 10,000 dollars, and I was able to buy things I didn’t have, that I needed. But, like life does, as soon as good things happen, bad things follow. And all of that money was gone in seconds. And now I’m in debt because of it (car repairs, sick pets, failing hardware).</p>

<p>About two years before that, I had a bestselling album in the darksynth sector of Bandcamp. Am I rich? Am I famous?</p>

<p>No, and no.</p>

<p>Shortly after having some big success in music, I was systematically removed from the synth/retro scene by bad actors who, to this day, still look to control this tiny niche of a music scene. However they see fit, to whatever ends they decide. It’s a copy, a carbon copy, of the real, actual music scene. And it blows nuts, and tons of ass.</p>

<p>I’ve been running a Patreon since 2012, and recently shifted over to Ko-fi and Liberapay. I’ve been working on a new album, a book, tons of Python scripts to make my website cooler, and my Mastodon instance more dynamic and interesting. I’ve been writing, <em>forever</em>, doing web design <em>even longer</em>. And I’m just about as broke as I was a decade ago. Just, now I have more bills, and a full time job that hardly pays for it all.</p>

<p>I live paycheck to paycheck, and I’ve been paying on debt for almost three years that never seems to go away. And soon, soon! I’ll have education expenses coming my way, as the buffer period starts to run out, and I start owing on classes for a major I didn’t even finish (computer science, physics, front-end development).</p>

<p>And I have an inkling of a suspicion that this is how a lot of people are living. A lot of people in this country owe a billion companies a ton of money, and at the end of the month they’re, like me, probably left with mostly peanuts to push around so that they can do things that bring them some kind of joy.</p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong, you should keep making things. Keep making silly little videos, keep drawing, keep making music, keep writing, keep creating. But don’t do it in the pursuit of extreme amounts of money and fame. The only people in the world who are rich beyond their wildest dreams were either lucky, or perpetuators of mass amounts of exploitation and pain.</p>

<p>Sure! Maybe one of the people reading this will get lucky, and you’ll have your wildest dreams come true, but for most of us? The life you’re living now is probably the way it’s going to be for a long time, if not, <em>for the rest of your life.</em> And that’s okay.</p>

<p>It’s not the luck that’s letting you down, it’s the <em>system</em>.</p>

<p>If every single person were rich and thriving, <em>nobody</em> would be. Being rich depends on other people being poor. And that’s why everything is so beyond screwed up, in 2024. A system that demands <em>some</em> people suffer, so that others can live in permanent comfort, <em>frickking sucks ass</em>, by design. And it’s not your fault!</p>

<p>So buy that Mocha Cappuccino, and subscribe to Max and watch Lord of the Dragons or whatever, and write that book, and then post it online so some soulless algorithm can copy and paste it into an uninspired jerkwad’s publishing machine. Wander around in Second Life and pretend you own a home, and then start a band. Play some music, make 40 albums, move to New York, and–</p>

<p>You know what, just do you.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="rich" /><category term="famous" /><category term="not" /><category term="gonna" /><category term="happen" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, there’s been a growing epidemic of excess.

I haven’t done so, mostly, because a lot has been going on in the world, and my head is spinning! In my personal life, I’m moving positions at work, so there’s a stressor, but not <em>too stressy</em>, because it’s a position I’m familiar with. And then in the real world, BAM. A health insurance CEO gets murked, and then there’s a multi-day manhunt, and it ends … with bro eating a burger at McDonalds?</p>

<p>I’m sure by now the whole entire internet has heard about the UHC assassination, and I’m also sure almost the entire internet <em>didn’t give a flying fart</em> that some billionaire who has caused the deaths of thousands (maybe even millions??) was killed. A life for many lives, seems fair? But then the shooter, whoms’t we’ll just call Luigi, since he’s been picked up by the cops … jumps on a bike, dumps a backpack, and then 3 days later emerges in Pennsylvania for a burger. At which point an elderly employee snitches on him.</p>

<p>Then the whirlwind comes out, and <a href="https://x.com/PepMangione" target="_blank">his Twitter</a> is unearthed, and his political leanings are as confusing as wrapping your head around how someone who was so careful from the start, ended up at McDonalds with all of the evidence the cops would need to arrest him. (/me breathes out) But, maybe he planned it that way? You know? Your face is on security cameras flirting with someone at a hostel (they have hostels in New York? They don’t just call them shared motels? The heck?), and maybe you figure, “Damn, uh, I am probably going to get caught, huh.”</p>

<p>And then he flips a switch and his Youtube starts uploading videos. The first one comes and it says something about how everything’s planned, and more is coming … “soon.” And then there’s a quick flash of the date, “December 11th.”</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/uhc/soon.png" /></p>

<p>A couple of hours later, another video premiere begins on a 45 minute timer, and this is all you see …</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/uhc/binary.png" /></p>

<p>For those who don’t know, or don’t want to decipher it, this is binary code that reads, “The Truth will set me free.”</p>

<p>About 20 minutes into the timer, Google / Youtube stepped in and deleted the entire channel. Although, I seriously <em>doubt</em> the content he had scheduled was deleted. I’m <em>sure</em> that’s on a Google server waiting to be sent to the police in Altoona or New York (whichever). But … that’ll be interesting to see, if <em>ever</em>.</p>

<p>Now, there are <em>other</em> things, like his praise of the Unabomber on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4065667863" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> where he <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/10j1le5/comment/j5i4x9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">quotes a Reddit user</a> in his thoughts on the book, and the world, in-general. And an apparent Instagram account, which … I won’t even <em>try</em> to find, as people flock to the site making new accounts under the man’s name in a vapid, shallow attempt at getting a ton of followers really quick before the story dies down (frikken opportunists).</p>

<p>I think it all brings together a rightful distaste for corporate America, and how our society is run. In that, <em>it sucks a whole lot of ass, and it ain’t getting any better.</em> But, if you were hoping his politics would be pure, so that it would be easier for you to excuse him: Good luck. In one moment he’s an anti-capitalist, and in the next he’s a traditionalist talking about birth rates in Japan.</p>

<p>If you were expecting someone who would 3D-print half of a Glock (a ghost gun), and then shoot someone in broad daylight to make total sense, <em>think again.</em></p>
