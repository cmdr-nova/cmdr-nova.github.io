This is incongruent with current trends of the past decade and a half, of the music industry pushing real hard for streaming. Streaming, which pays fractions of a penny of a penny on a dollar, while the rich consume the profits. This has only been exasperated since AI came into the scene, with people absent of talent and inspiration, generating <em>absolute garbage</em> (and this isn’t just a problem in music, it’s everywhere).</p>

<p>I personally haven’t seen, heard, or noticed any detrimental effects of Bandcamp being bought-out, but it’s good to be prepared. To be prepared in an age where Mozilla is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/advertising/" target="_blank">suddenly an ad agency</a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://mashable.com/article/microsoft-copilot-recall-cybersecurity-disaster" target="_blank">developing spyware</a>, OpenAI is asking governments for enough <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank">electrical power</a> to destroy the entire planet, and Apple is <a href="https://applescoop.org/story/shocking-apple-vision-pro-2-reportedly-cancelled" target="_blank">releasing products</a> people <em>don’t want</em>.</p>

<p>We’re living in a universe that is slowly becoming a perpetual backwards day (not that Microsoft was ever a decent forward-thinking company, or that OpenAI ever had any good intentions with their grift of theft, but I digress…).</p>

<p>But there are those who read my musings, who know I’m a freak for the fediverse.</p>

<p>You might guess where this is going.</p>

<p>“Wait, are you about to tell me that there’s a motherfuggin’ Bandcamp, ON THE FEDIVERSE?”</p>

<p>Yes, yes I am about to tell you that, Fortnite Gamer.</p>

<p>This morning, while I was slogging away at getting ready for work, I saw a post flash past my Mastodon feed, something like, “It’s Bandcamp, but on the fediverse!”</p>

<p>I thought to myself, “Hmm, okay. I’ll bookmark this for 10 hours from now.”</p>
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="img-wrap">
<img src="/img/posts/bandwagon/tenhours.png" />
</div>
</div>
<p>So, I clicked the link and followed through to <a href="https://bandwagon.fm" target="_blank">Bandwagon.fm</a>, and, my dudes …</p>

<p>I now have a “bandcamp” on the fediverse, <a href="https://bandwagon.fm/@cmdr_nova" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

<p>Save for the ability to actually <em>sell</em> your music (which I assume they’re working on?), you can upload whole entire albums here, and then people can stumble in and listen to what you’ve made! That’s WILD. … on the FEDIVERSE?!</p>

<p>What I did here with my page, though, is I took the 3 most recent albums I did under Eyeshadow 2600 FM, and re-published them under my new name, PLEXX. Once I <em>finally</em> finish <a href="https://plexx.bandcamp.com/album/disc-error-1992-de-lux" target="_blank">disc eRROR 19​.​92 ~DE​-​LUX</a>, I’ll be putting that album there, too.</p>

<p>But this is <em>so cool</em>, and it’s connected to Musicbrainz, another open-source music cataloguing project!</p>

<p>Earlier today, I was having second thoughts about Linux, and sticking to open source and all that. Mostly because, I sort of miss a few programs that I’m having trouble getting working on Pop!_OS. But this kind of turned me around a bit. There’s <em>no</em> reason to go back to the bastardized version of whatever Bill Gates had in mind 30 years ago. This proves to me that regular people <em>will</em> restore the internet to what it should have always been.</p>

<p>The only thing it takes, is <em>patience</em>, and a whole lot less second-guessing myself and my decisions. And also maybe I need to sit in front of my computer screen a little less here and there. My eyes hurt.</p>

<p>Anyway, I <em>can’t wait</em> to see what the heck comes next, holy crap.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Social Media" /><category term="social-media" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m sure there are those who know that Bandcamp was recently bought out by a company called Songtradr, and this came with much dismay, because Bandcamp has been, and has mostly remained, one of the only music platforms where small artists could actually be discovered, heard, and paid.

<p>Enter: the_daily_report</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/cmdr-nova/the_daily_report/tree/main" target="_blank">simple python script</a> that you need only make a personal Reddit app for, and then you’re done (mostly).</p>

<p>I’m still a bit of a noob, learning all of this stuff as I go, like you do, and <em>how I do</em>. So, I’m writing this with it scheduled to send me my daily report at 9am, everyday, and guess what, it works!</p>

<p>Voila:</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/thereport/the_report_example.png" /></p>

<p>I initially had to do a ton of troubleshooting, because my machine <em>doesn’t</em> just automatically send e-mails when I tell it to, and I’ve detailed as much of that as I could in a troubleshooting section via the repository. Hopefully it’s clear enough what needs to be done.</p>

<p>I have this issue where, I’ll use someone’s app, and then their help files make no sense, or are woefully incomplete. In writing my own, I now see why that may happen, because I’m basically just throwing in solutions I used and hoping they stick!</p>

<p>Now, <em>obviously</em>, this means you have to have your PC turned on at all times, unless of course you setup a server on a remote PC, such as renting a VPS over at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. I’ve <em>considered</em> this for myself, but I don’t know if sending myself a daily report of trending posts in subreddits is really something I should just dump money into. Mostly, because I <em>do</em> have my PC on at all times, in-between minutes every couple of days that I restart the thing.</p>

<p>But it’s an option!</p>

<p>Anyway, you can see the whole thing in the link above, and hopefully, if I’ve done my job correctly, you can get it running for yourself.</p>

<p>Note: I do not use Windows, and I cannot tell you how to make this work on a Microsoft machine!</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Programming" /><category term="programming" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re like me, and you just can’t find it in yourself to quit the nerd-site, then maybe you should make it easier on yourself, and setup something to just give you a daily report (e-mail) on your favorite subreddits’ top five trending posts.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Life Without a Computer?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writing%20prompt/2024/10/03/life-without-a-computer.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life Without a Computer?" /><published>2024-10-03T22:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-03T22:15:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writing%20prompt/2024/10/03/life-without-a-computer</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writing%20prompt/2024/10/03/life-without-a-computer.html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been at least two months since I’ve done one of Jetpack’s writing prompts. Largely, because, I ditched Wordpress and decided to build something from scratch. It seems, in light of the Wordpress CEO’s recent blunders, it was <em>probably a good idea</em> to abandon Wordpress. But I really only did it because I enjoy writing everything in VS Code, rather than a glitchy editor. Nevertheless, I still have Automattic’s “jetpack” app installed on my phone, and it serves me interesting writing prompts every once in a while, and because I don’t enjoy writing about a crisis every single time I fire up the VSC, I think I’ll snag this one.</p>

<p>So, full-stop, I had access to a computer in about 1992, I believe. I think I spoke about this before, but it was something my Dad was provided by his job, and it <em>wasn’t</em> exactly up-to-date with current versions of Windows. It was more like a mid-80s machine with <em>extremely</em> early versions of DOS, and bulletin boards. The menu was built into a permanent console, like something you write through via Linux (for the zoomies who don’t know what the hell DOS is), and it was … pretty basic.</p>

<p>I think that thing is still sitting around, <em>somewhere</em> out there.</p>

<p>As time marched forward, we got another PC, and another PC, and then a Gateway 486, and then that was largely what I used, until I was given another “hand-me-down”-ish PC when I was around 15 or 16. About the time I discovered anime forums, and started e-dating as many girls as I could … with video chat over aol instant messenger, and … a whole lot of embarrassing things I probably shouldn’t have been sharing with girls I, ultimately, <em>didn’t really know</em>, at all.</p>

<p>Then, when I graduated, I was gifted <em>another PC</em>, which is when I <em>really</em> started gaming. And then years later I built one myself, and then I upgraded it, and then I bought another PC. And then I ditched that one, and bought one in 2018, and then I ditched that one, too, and bought the powerhouse Linux PC I’m currently using today (alongside the Windows Dell, and Macbook I have as side machines).</p>

<p>What would life be like, had none of this ever happened?</p>

<p>I guess I’d probably watch paint dry? Or, am I still allowed to have my iPhone? Cause, if that’s the case, I guess the only thing that’d be different is I’d probably be some kind of prolific mobile gamer, who never got into web development. Maybe I’d be streaming to Twitch via my phone as I bumble around Genshin Impact. Who knows!</p>

<p>But, let’s say the phone is also a computer.</p>

<p><em>This question is far too open-ended for the 2020s, don’t you think?</em></p>

<p>So, no PC, no laptops, no phone, no toasters with touch-screens, and we’ll just assume, in this version of the universe, my job <em>also</em> hasn’t given me a phone to work with.</p>

<p>Alright.</p>

<p>Since television is mainly on streaming now, and basic “appointment TV” doesn’t really exist anymore (and by that, I mean, episodic television that isn’t dumped all at once), I guess I’d probably have a Smart TV, and I’d probably spend <em>a lot</em> of my time watching shows. Maybe I’d also read a lot more. I don’t know if I’d be writing, because … I guess I’d have to do that by <em>hand</em>? Like a <strong><em>baby</em></strong>. But, that’s the thing, a smart TV is also a computer! We’ll, for the sake of this post, just pretend that it isn’t, though.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I’d have a richer social life, because I think factors that made it harder for me to connect with people in the 2020s, <em>aren’t</em> really related to having access to a PC, but more that people in-general are, or have, isolated themselves in their own little bubbles of media that they themselves dictate. Which, in-turn, makes casual conversation <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p>But … without access to all of the world’s knowledge and information, I guess I’d probably be a lot more uninformed. I’d probably be much more susceptible to just <em>believing</em> anything anyone tells me. I’d probably question things less. I wouldn’t have random college credits sitting on my name, and I guess I wouldn’t have a resume, either?</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>

<p>Uh, I think we’ll skip this universe.</p>

<p>I think it’s pretty important to have access to technology, and the internet. Because, just sitting here thinking about what life would be like <em>without</em> all this stuff, sounds … horrifying. And, maybe that’s nerdy. But damn, dude, no. No I don’t think I’d want to live a life of watching TV and sleeping.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Writing Prompt" /><category term="writing-prompt" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been at least two months since I’ve done one of Jetpack’s writing prompts.

But more, a time when things were less chaotic, and we were all kinda just vibing with whatever was happening. Drinking our Ecto-Coolers, slipping on Velcro sneakers, uh, watching Rocko’s Modern Life.</p>

<p>But sometimes I also wish it was still 2012. Still in the midst of the Mass Effect trilogy, the greatest game series <em>ever created</em>. Still logging onto a <em>mostly</em> normal Facebook to get my daily clicks in Mafia Wars and Farmville.</p>

<p><img class="img-wrap" src="/img/posts/2012/mafiwars.png" /></p>

<p>A time when Sims 3 was the latest and greatest of the franchise, and <em>all I was doing</em> in the game was walking my sim around collecting diamonds and rocks, and trying to figure out what kind of bathroom she should have. When I was still mystified by new experiences, and finding wonder in exploring new narratives. Back when the iPhone still had what I think were the best icon graphics, a headphone jack, and iPods! Yeah, I had an iPod Touch! …that I played digital poker with.</p>

<p>When I’d jump on Google cam-chats with friends, lay in bed, and just talk all night long, and when Youtube was just a place where people uploaded random weird stuff that wasn’t designed to pull you in and keep you there for ad-rolls and sponsored segments.</p>

<p>… when cigarettes only cost like, four dollars a pack.</p>

<p>A year wherein I’d get out of work and still have the energy to <em>do things that I enjoy</em>.</p>

<p>I miss 2012.</p>

<p>There’s no use living in the past, but there were <em>a lot</em> of great things about technology in the 90s, and 2000s, and even 2010. And then suddenly it all started going downhill. Things <em>advanced</em>, but for <em>no reason</em>. Oh boy, bigger cameras, larger screens, thinner bezels, s … streaming? I don’t <em>own</em> my music and movies anymore? All the casual games I liked using to pass time are on my phone? Sweet! … oh, almost <em>all of them</em> are copies of each other and filled with so much money-grubbing they could only really be classified as a game for the first 5 minutes that you interact with it?</p>

<p>Instagram is about posting engagement-bait and getting popular with short-form content until you can … get sponsored with product placement?</p>

<p>Twitter got murdered by Elon Musk and now it’s just nazis and ai-gen spam?</p>

<p>What the <em>heck</em>?</p>

<p><strong><em>I miss 2012.</em></strong></p>

<p>It’s not all bad. We got Mastodon, we got a federated network of users taking ownership of their content, and the indie web (a revival of the 90s internet). There are still <em>good</em> games out there, and a whole lot of indie developers who make some real gems. But, <em>man</em>, do you really have to sift through mountains and oceans of garbage to find content and entertainment <em>actually worth consuming</em>.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I’m just getting older, and everything is just <em>fine</em> the way it is.</p>

Partially because, <em>usually</em>, when I share what I write, <em>it doesn’t even show a headline</em>. But, you’re probably wondering, “What could Mastodon/the fediverse possibly have that MySpace doesn’t?”</p>

<p>Twitter has fabricated and AI generated misinformation, Threads has influencers in a battle royale to see who can steal the most posts written by normal people, Bluesky has all the bullies from social justice circles who never got anywhere with their quote-tweet dogpiling, and Mastodon has …</p>

<center>
<img src="/img/posts/monsterdon/monsterdon.png" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Snarky and sarcastic remarks aside, this <em>isn’t</em> really isolated to Mastodon. It’s just that it’s <em>named</em> after Mastodon. But, like all things on the fediverse, it reaches most software connected to it. But that’s not what this post is about. We’re talking about something here that I’ve <em>never</em> really seen outside of Discord channels and chat-rooms.</p>

<p>A community-wide sort of event that happens every Sunday at 9pm eastern standard time.</p>

<p>A cheesy horror or monster movie is chosen, usually from anywhere between the forties, fifties, and sixties (and maybe sometimes the seventies and eighties), and then everyone who <em>wants to</em>, loads up the movie at the aforementioned time, and the fediverse turns into a waterfall of a huge amount of people posting to the #monsterdon hashtag their impressions and witticisms about whatever movie they all happen to be watching in that given week. Jesus, that was a hell of a run-on sentence.</p>

<p>I participated in it once so far, and then every subsequent time its happened since, <em>I forget, and forget, and forget</em>. But I do peek in every once in a while, when it happens, and I’m suddenly reminded that I forgot to participate. And … it’s kind of amazing?</p>

<p>In the past decade, social media has transformed into this thing where people are target searching. They’re looking for someone to dunk, looking for someone to use for engagement and five minutes of fame. Looking for things they hate so that they can react, and reaffirm to their followers that their opinions are the correct and best opinions to have.</p>

<p>In <em>some</em> cases, this is kind of exaggerated and not nearly as bad as it sounds. Taking a stand against injustice is <em>good</em>, even if there <em>are</em> people out there using these things for their own personal gain and fame. But, I’m trying to reinforce that, over all these years, a lot of social media has turned into this negative experience that most of us are <em>heavily</em> addicted to. No matter how bad the car crash, ya just can’t stop looking at it. The mangled metal, the broken glass, it’s like candy for the brain-juice. Uh … or maybe people don’t really look at a car crash like that, but you get what I mean!</p>

<p>And then you stumble into Mastodon, or the fediverse, and every Sunday there’s just people watching a dang movie. They’re not fighting, not spitting bile, just … enjoying something … together! In a fully digital space, where I’m <em>assuming</em> most people don’t even know each other!</p>

<p>It kind of reinforces this idea that the fediverse is the old web, reborn. The social web, resurrected. I <em>definitely</em> would’ve expected to see something like this on MySpace, if that sort of thing would’ve been possible back then. But definitely not on Twitter, or any of those other sites that are less about being social, and more about capital gains. And with all of the definitely <em>bad</em> things happening in the world, it’s just kind of nice to see totally normal and cool things happening. Totally nice things that definitely don’t suck.</p>

<p>I wanted to write this post just to say, keep it up!

Part of that is because my day job highly makes me feel like I don’t want to do <em>anything</em> when I get out of work. The other part of it, is that I spent hours and hours refreshing and updating the look and feel of my site (it’s cooler now). Now that I’ve done that, I’d like to write about Vivaldi.</p>

<p>A little while ago I wrote about the <a href="/tech/2024/09/09/tell-mozilla-how-you-feel-about-ai">on-going blunders of the Mozilla Foundation</a>, and their head-long dive into AI, and the manipulation of <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-search-update/" target="_blank">hiding data hijacking</a> within features that promise privacy. Basically, Mozilla needs money, and they’re selling their souls in order to get it.</p>

<p>If you’re like me, and you <em>just want a good browser</em> that doesn’t have a ton of bloat, that isn’t taking your private data and selling it to some corporation, or what-have-you, then you already know what you need.</p>

<p><em>A better browser.</em></p>

<p>Firefox has been my go-to for a <em>long</em> time. It’s a decent browser! But, if I decide I want to actually interact with AI, I <em>don’t need it embedded in frikken’ Firefox</em>. And I don’t think this is where their resources, their time, and their effort should be going.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve switched to Vivaldi. A browser I <em>think</em> I’ve heard of before, but never really used? Never-the-less, I was pretty surprised when I finally did. I mean, right off the bat, <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/" target="_blank">they’ve pledged</a> <em>not</em> to dedicate resources to integrate AI into their browser. Which, for all intents and purposes, that’s all you gotta say!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such, it does not feel right to bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m a very hard-no on AI generated “art.” Ripping people off in order to funnel money into people’s pockets, who’ve done nothing but write a sentence, is the epitome of evil and greed. Using regular AI to generate text, or books, or anything of the sort, is definitely the <em>same kind</em> of plagiarist evil. But, I <em>will</em> acknowledge that there can be <em>some</em> uses in regard to AI chat bots … even though the power consumption is just as bad, or <em>worse</em> than the blockchain and NFTs. So, I find it <em>really</em> hard to justify using them. I <em>have</em>, though. I’ve asked an AI for some ideas on writing prompts to get my juices flowing. I’ve used an AI over my phone at work to help customers when I don’t know the answer to, “What kind of battery do I need for a Ford Pinto 1992, 4 cylinder, special edition, Pro Max?” And it has helped.</p>

<p>I will admit, and be transparent, in that I have personally found <em>some</em> use in these things. But I also ask myself, “Could I have just found this information on a search engine that isn’t mired by crud? Could I have done it without using a machine that’s on its way to being hooked up to a nuclear reactor twenty miles away from me?”</p>

<p>But, all of that’s beside my point in this article, in that, Vivaldi <em>isn’t</em> going to put this stuff into their browser. And they’re not <em>ignoring</em> their userbase in order to do whatever they want, for profit, and for violation of privacy. And that’s a big breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>And <em>all of this</em> is completely aside from the absolutely <em>cool as hell</em> features Vivaldi has built-in.</p>

<p>The browser … AUTOMATICALLY BLOCKS ADS! You don’t need an extension! IT WORKS ON YOUTUBE. You can just view websites, ad-free, by … opening your web browser? Holy crap.</p>

<p>Of course, you have customization options, sync options, theme options, password and bookmark import and saving, and so on and so forth. But what I’ve found <em>really</em> useful, is the right-side bar that you can <em>connect to your Apple calendar</em>, and the RSS feed aggregator that you can just plug some RSS into, and see updates from all the blogs you read, live, right there on the side of your browser. There’s a translate button, a note button, a reminders button, a button that opens their personal Vivaldi Mastodon instance, and <em>so much more</em>.</p>

<p>It’s the end-all, be-all of browsers, and I cannot believe that this isn’t some super famous, extremely well-known browser and company that’s taking the entire world by storm … <strong><em>Because they should be.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to write about how impressed I am with the Vivaldi browser. I can’t say I’m too sure what’s going on with the Social Web Foundation, but what that entails for sure remains to be seen.</p>

<p>I think you should <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">give it a go</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a couple of days since I’ve written anything.

<p><a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Auriga/116/17/2003" target="_blank">Drop on by the store</a> within Second Life and check them out! Or, if you’re busy, in a jam, or generally unable to be in Second Life right this moment, you can see them on the <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/REVOSA-Nano-Nexus-OS95-Edition/26431919" target="_blank">marketplace page</a>.</p>

<p>You might notice that the store location has changed <em>again</em>, but let me explain. The current location is a backup that I’ve had for a little over a month, in the event that I would have to move from the location that was provided to me. It turns out, I unfortunately have to do that. I attribute no fault to Logan, and I extend my deepest gratitude for being allowed to use the land he had in order to host my store. It’s not every day you meet someone in Second Life who’s willing to offer a helping hand.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this won’t really affect the store, because it’ll now just be at my fully Backrooms/Pool Rooms themed location. And although the size may be deceiving, I actually have plenty of <em>space</em> to work with.</p>

<p>And to all of the frequent shoppers, and those who have continued to shop from, and visit [REVOSA] for nearly ten years going, <em>thank you</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Second Life" /><category term="second-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, following the end of the month-long shopping event at the Progeny Mall, the Nano Nexus (OS95 Edition) shorts are now available at the store!

To say that I’m a bit pissed off is an understatement.</p>

<p>So, let’s get straight to the vomit from the horse’s mouth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think individual creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content in the grand scheme of this,” Zuckerberg said in the interview, which coincides with Meta’s annual Connect event. “My guess is that there are going to be certain partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable.” But if creators are concerned or object, “when push comes to shove, if they demanded that we don’t use their content, then we just wouldn’t use their content. It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this point forward, <a href="https://mkultra.monster/about" target="_blank">mkultra.monster</a> will be suspending any and all interaction with Threads.net. I won’t tell others what to do, but I’ve been teetering on this decision for a while. There are cool and decent people on Threads, but it’s just not worth it.</p>

<p>A billionaire thinks all of your thoughts, your memories, your written and graphical work and design … <em>isn’t worth shit.</em></p>

<p>But, it must be worth a hell of a lot if you’re feeding it into your sludge machine so that you can generate some glossy garbage that sucks ass, am I wrong?</p>

<p>Either way, I’m going to do what I should’ve done months ago, and I’m gonna Zuck the Zuck.</p>

<p>Go to hell, Meta.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that’s going to change the outcome of this stuff that much.” Are the words of a man giving every writer, developer, creator, and artist a big, bold middle finger.</p>

<p>Those are all the words I have to give right now, and it’s exactly the right amount.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I, regrettably, have to talk about this by quoting from The Verge, but a couple of hours ago they published a talk with the Zuck on Meta’s AI, and the training data associated with it.

Basically, this group of companies and corporations who are banding together to throw their hats together as a supporting web to build up ActivityPub and the Fediverse. Except … It reads and feels a lot like, “We made this.”</p>

<p>As some may know, I’ve written about Mastodon, all of its diverse software, ActivityPub, and the Fediverse <em>quite</em> frequently. I even wrote a <a class="page-link" href="/pages/activitypub">little bit of a beginner’s guide</a> to jumping in, which also features some <em>history</em>. History that is entirely missing from TSWF.</p>

<p>My first question to all of this would be: Who <em>exactly</em> asked for this? The Fediverse, as mentioned in my guide, has existed since 2008, <em>without</em> corporate or moneyed influence.</p>

<p>Quoted from their mission page,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fediverse cannot thrive without people building clients or running providers. And to do those things, they need money. Whether that’s advertising supported, or funded by charities and non-profits, or based on paid-for services, or affiliate revenue, we are working to find ways that companies can do well in the Fediverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a majority of the people who populate the Fedi, we don’t <em>care</em> if companies are doing well across the protocol. It wasn’t <em>built for them.</em> And it should remain that way.</p>

<p>Yes, I run my own instance. No, I don’t make <em>any</em> money from it. And if I ever <em>did</em>, it would be entirely up to future potential users who want to support mkultra.monster. But, until then, it’s run entirely out-of-pocket, and <em>I’m okay with that</em>. I chose to do this, and I’m running a hosted service that caps out at a certain amount of users. And I’m also okay with that! I have no interest in running a social media platform that’s populated by one hundred million people.</p>

<p>Now, there are a lot of companies and non-profits coming together on this page, companies, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flipboard</li>
  <li>Automattic</li>
  <li>Meta</li>
  <li>Ghost</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>IFTAS</li>
  <li>Write.as</li>
  <li>Fastly</li>
  <li>Vivaldi</li>
  <li>The BLVD</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it kinda makes sense that writing platforms want to get in on ActivityPub and the Fediverse. But I feel a little uneasy about Automattic getting <em>too</em> involved. Their CEO is a <em>major</em> douche-nozzle, who once had a meltdown over a joke on Tumblr, and just recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/wp-engine-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-automattic-over-mullenwegs-comments/?guccounter=1" target="_blank">slandered a Wordpress provider</a> <em>for no reason</em>.</p>

<p>Vivaldi makes more sense to me, even though they’re a web browser provider. But, their words on the matter are actually aligned with what many people across the Fediverse believe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Fediverse reminds us of the early days of the Web. We are competing against silos and corporate interests, using a W3C-based open standard and a distributed solution,” says Jon Von Tetzchner, CEO of Vivaldi (<a href="https://social.vivaldi.net/@jon" target="_blank">@jon@vivaldi.net</a>). “It’s great that social networking companies are supporting the Fediverse, and Vivaldi is pleased to support the Social Web Foundation so that we can once again have a town square free of algorithms and corporate control.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes <em>absolutely no sense</em> when you put these words and these developers <em>right next</em> to Meta, and Threads.</p>

<p>I’ve spoken <em>a lot</em> about Threads. I feel like, if you’re an instance provider on the Fedi, it’s entirely up to you whether you want to federate with them or not. But let’s not forget, Meta is a corporation. One of the <em>richest</em> corporations in the world, who definitely have <em>corporate</em> interests when it comes to social media, the web, and <em>ActivityPub</em>.</p>

<p>On top of that, it has been almost an entire <em>year</em>, and they still have not fully integrated federation on Threads. As it stands right now, likes and comments coming from the Fediverse show up as additional links you have to click multiple times in order to see, <em>while on Threads</em>. It’s a very tacked-on, a very, “These people aren’t Threads users, but here they are if you <em>really</em> want to see them” kind of gesture. Right now, its mostly superficial, and it rubs me the wrong way. It makes me feel like they <em>don’t</em> have any intention of <em>true</em> integration.</p>

<p>Not mentioned, but included in the list, are Mastodon and Pixelfed. These are, <em>at least</em>, entities that have been involved for a long time, and are partially responsible for the Fediverse becoming just a little bit more mainstream than it was before.</p>

<p>But where’s the mention of Akkoma, Pleroma, GNU Social, Freindika, Misskey, <strong><em>Peertube</em></strong>, and so on, and so forth? Are we just going to ignore them into the ether?</p>

<p>The Fediverse is home to something like … 15 million people or so (not that much more than Bluesky, and with this news, bsky devs are probably sharting themselves)? And it’s only growing as users on Threads turn on federation. But if companies and corporations can’t see themselves as part of the Fediverse without injecting money, sponsors, and ads into it, <em>then they should get out, and stay out.</em> The internet is <em>overrun</em> with sludge-content designed to waste your time and steal your attention for someone else’s financial gain. Rebuilding the open web is completely and entirely about escaping all of that, <em>for good</em>. It’s about bringing back the days of <em>people</em>, building their own spaces, having their own ideas and conversations free of algorithms and corporate influence.</p>

<p>To want to interfere in that, and possibly even <em>destroy</em> it, well. Maybe I <em>should</em> full-block Threads, and other corporate entrances into the Fediverse via my instance.</p>

<p>I really don’t know right now.</p>]]></content><author><name>𐕣 C M D R ░ NOVA 𐕣</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, kind of just completely out-of-the-blue, this thing called “The Social Web Foundation” launched.
