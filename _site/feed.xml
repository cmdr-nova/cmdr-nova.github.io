<p>I‚Äôm not saying that community notes on Twitter have been a <em>bad thing</em>, because they‚Äôve actually been pretty funny when its been used against liars and people who fabricate situations in order to embolden hate. But, it‚Äôs the context, and the reasons you have to look at. Mack Fucklenarg has never been genuine or progressively-inclined about anything he‚Äôs ever done. From building The Facebook, which was originally <a href="https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/before-facebook-zuckerberg-created-a-girl-rating-site-facemash" target="_blank">a website used to rate the ‚Äúhotness‚Äù of girls in college</a>, to seemingly condemning the acts of the January 6th terrorists.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/meta-censors/jan6.jpg" /></p>

<p>This was, and you guessed it, manipulative pandering to the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Fark Bafflenard doesn‚Äôt have <em>any core beliefs</em>. Like all billionaires, he follows the money, and he follows his own interests in not wanting to be potentially arrested and imprisoned by the currently incoming administration. It is only a complete coincidence if your beliefs and your virtues <em>ever</em> line up with what Mark Zugzugsomethingneeddoing is currently doing, or saying.</p>

<p>Right now, those actions are lining up with the same criminals and potential mass shooters that Twitter harbors. And that‚Äôs a bad thing. A bad thing for people who enjoy posting within a civilized atmosphere that at least attempts to pretend that we‚Äôre living in 2025, and not 1825.</p>

<p>If, in 4 years, a straight-up communist is somehow elected, I‚Äôm almost entirely <em>sure</em> that Marky-Mark would make statements on how Meta and its properties will release control of its production means to its users.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just as pathetic as Diamond-Mine Musk using memes from 15 years ago in an attempt to impress neo nazis who are in their 40s and 50s.</p>

<p>Men who go through life believing in nothing, who hold insurmountable amounts of power over mass amounts of people, will be the downfall of civilized society.</p>

<p>But, despite all of Meta‚Äôs mistakes, its family of apps hold more than <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/meta-q4-2023-earnings-record-revenue-monthly-users-1235894587/" target="_blank">3.98 billion users</a> (as of February 1st, 2024), and that‚Äôs a staggering amount of people. That‚Äôs about half of the entire world‚Äôs popu-frikken-lation. And while I‚Äôve seen the usual round of people promising they‚Äôre moving to Bluesky (which is honestly not even much better of a platform), I don‚Äôt think there is <em>any way</em> in any shape or form, that you will <em>ever</em> convince half the world‚Äôs population to join Mastodon, or even the Twitter-carbon-copy, Bluesky.</p>

<p>Like with most things, the average user only cares about ease of use, and if you can sign up for Threads by already having an Instagram account, that eliminates the process of even just setting up an account. You‚Äôre already there! An advantage that Meta has over <em>all other platforms</em>. And this is why I think it is incredibly important that Mastodon, and other ActivityPub apps and projects, work toward simplifying the onboarding process even more than they already have.</p>

<p>It is imperative to get as many people off of propaganda platforms as humanly possible, because, the annoying people from 2017 Tumblr ‚Ä¶ were correct, after-all.</p>

And, every single time, I imagine these people think they‚Äôre doing something productive, or revolutionary, or funny. But here‚Äôs the news flash: You‚Äôre not. If you wouldn‚Äôt use blockchain tech, or buy NFTs in 2022, then you shouldn‚Äôt be generating sludge as a joke, either.</p>

<p>Situations like this remind of me old Mastodon instances in the pre-2020 era of the fediverse, that were erected solely for ‚Äúshitposting.‚Äù They start out funny, or mildly annoying (because, let‚Äôs face it, if the only thing you ever post is incoherent jokes, you become tiring after about a day), and usually mostly politically left-leaning. Then, the jokes get worse, and worse. And suddenly, the instance is being flooded with neo nazis and predators, because you decided that ironic fascist jokes weren‚Äôt over-the-line. And now you‚Äôre just no different than them.</p>

<p>I can just vaguely recall Mastodon instances that were shutdown within months of opening, such as bofa.lol, kazink, and so on. And shitposters.club, a currently active server that is instance-blocked by <em>most</em> instances across the fediverse. <em>All guilty of exactly the same things</em>.</p>

<p>Why do I bring up this comparison?</p>

<p>Partially, because I have a personal grudge against people whose entire personality is shitty jokes (see: the monumentally huge amount of harassment I‚Äôve received on Bluesky for practically no reason at all, from people who have bad taste in humor and politics). But also, because this is an extremely predictable pipeline that <em>always leads to opening the door for undesirables (fascists, crypto-brained losers, sludge-enjoyers)</em>.</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt even the only reason you shouldn‚Äôt do this, though! Making yourself indistinguishable from people who have no qualms with the destruction of human creativity, and art is, <em>bad enough</em>, but then you also have to take into account the harm you‚Äôre causing the <em>actual literal planet every single time you make a prompt</em>.</p>

<p>Quote from <a href="https://www.watertechnologies.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-using-ton-water-heres-how-be-more-resourceful" target="_blank">watertech.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Artificial intelligence (AI) quickly went from a neat parlor trick to a business imperative. IBM reports that 82% of large enterprises have either deployed AI or are experimenting with doing so. Unlike other technology innovations like smartphones or WiFi networks, AI isn‚Äôt a one-time integration. The technology is constantly evolving with new models and capabilities.
<br />
<br />
Each time these AI tools are prompted, there‚Äôs a cost that few consider. Researchers believe that each string of prompts uses roughly 16 ounces of water at data centers that house these AI systems. Extrapolate AI use globally, and it‚Äôs clear how water systems are taxed. Microsoft‚Äôs latest environmental report shows its water consumption jumped 34% from 2021 to 2022, reaching nearly 1.7 billion gallons. Google reports its water consumption went up nearly 22% over the same period to a staggering 5.56 billion gallons, about 800 times as big as The Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool.
</blockquote>

<p>And that doesn‚Äôt even mention the carbon dioxide generated from the fossil-fuel powered electricity that we use, that <em>has already been melting the ice caps for about fifty to sixty years, or more</em>.</p>

<p>Some of these people might argue that you do the same amount of harm by charging your smartphone, or running a microwave. But, if that‚Äôs true (and those were just crude examples), why in the world would you feel it necessary to <em>double</em> the harm you‚Äôre doing by generating some uncanny-valley sludge in response to racist propaganda?</p>

<p>Oh, I see, it‚Äôs <em>funny</em>, because Donald Trump is just a drooling baby and Elon Musk is the actual sitting president. Ah.</p>

<p>And you couldn‚Äôt have dictated your little joke with <em>words</em>, and a little bit of stock footage? Or, remembered that Joe Biden is still currently in the White House (as of posting this)?</p>

<p>To give some closing perspective, here are some websites and communities that have been willingly (by their creators) destroyed by generative AI.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/tag/ai" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>: Once a place for artists to share their work, and even sell it, now overrun by inauthentic slop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/1275449912004" target="_blank">Etsy</a>: Once a place for creatives to make money off of the things they make, and do, now a place where you can use algorithmically stolen work, that <em>can‚Äôt legally even be copyrighted</em> to make money off the backs of those <em>same exact people</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nanowrimo-organizers-classist-and-ableist-to-condemn-ai/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>: Once a fun community event about writing for yourself a 50,000 word novel in the month of November, now fully endorses plagiarism bots. And this is a <em>special</em> case, because they <em>originally</em> called those who are against AI <em>ableist</em>, for not wanting plagiarism and creative theft in writing spaces. And then they doubled back and deleted that statement, and edited it to talk down to those critical of AI as if they‚Äôre our angry parents.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And that‚Äôs just to name a few. There are many more spaces and communities that either have already been destroyed by the continuing enshitification of anything good that‚Äôs left in the world, by big tech companies, or those that are currently being targeted. This is why <em>so many people</em> have been fleeing corporate social media. And the <em>last</em> thing you should do, is bring it with you, in the form of bad jokes and a vitriolic personality, <em>just to be ironic</em> on Bluesky, or even <em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

And, almost <em>immediately</em> afterward, scores of people began planning their move away from Threads across the platform (post-2023 social media is just a game of digital hot potato). Other users scoured Instagram and Facebook to find a slew of 20 some bots ‚Ä¶ including a fake black woman pretending to have a family, and culture.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/meta-dead/liv.png" /></p>

<p>As it turns out, these weren‚Äôt actually the bots that Meta was planning to implement, rather, they were experiments from over a year ago that nobody noticed and/or completely ignored, until Mark started to bring attention to his next, biggest, worst decision. These profiles are now deleted, as complaints were made against the accounts ‚Ä¶ <em>because you couldn‚Äôt block them</em>, and due to major backlash, in-general.</p>

<p>Via <a href="https://www.404media.co/metas-ai-profiles-are-indistinguishable-from-terrible-spam-that-took-over-facebook/" target="_blank">404 Media</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"There is confusion: the recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product," Sweeney said. "The accounts referenced are from a test we launched at Connect in 2023. These were managed by humans and were part of an early experiment we did with AI characters. We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.‚Äù 
</blockquote>

<p>It seems these bots were completely willing to de-mask their creators, showing us that both of these accounts, and the others, were all constructed by a team of mostly white guys. Which, and I‚Äôm not a genius or anything, but, looks <em>real</em> bad, chief. But it <em>does</em> further the conversation as to <em>what exactly</em> the goal was, or <em>is</em> with these things. Some have said the the goal is to ‚Äúdrive engagement,‚Äù but, to what end, and how? You going to use AI to boost real human beings?</p>

<p>Or, you‚Äôre going to ask content creators to use your AI tools in order to develop caricatures of themselves that can interact with people <em>for them</em>, thereby discouraging human interaction on a social media platform. Because if there‚Äôs anything billionaires hate more than losing a single cent to paying their <em>goddamn taxes</em>, it‚Äôs regular, <em>real</em> human beings, who still have functioning frontal lobes. And the assumption, is, I guess, that <em>everyone else must be like this, too</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/meta-dead/tools.png" /></p>

<p>In the age of tomfoolery, and fuckery, and generative slop that guzzles gallons of fresh water <em>every single time</em> you make a prompt, I think it‚Äôs important to <em>begin</em> the move away from corporate social media. If you can. Albeit, I do exist on Meta social media, and that‚Äôs entirely for my own reasons‚ÄìI‚Äôm conflicted, and I have work that I‚Äôd like to reach more than a few handfuls of people with, because I don‚Äôt want to work retail for the rest of my natural life, until I‚Äôm replaced by an AI bot that will inevitably hallucinate that I was <em>never actually born</em>.</p>

<p>But, this is your regular reminder that user-owned social media exists, and you have full control over the things you see, and interact with online ‚Ä¶ even if Meta will never truly delete or relinquish your data, no matter <em>what</em> you do with your accounts. And if we can get people en-masse to move to the protocol mentioned below, then maybe even <em>more</em> people will feel like they don‚Äôt have to keep one foot in the digital hell, and the other in the place where they actually want to be.</p>

I don‚Äôt know that I have any resolutions this time. I have ‚Ä¶ goals! Goals I would like to actually meet this year. I want to pay down this debt that I incurred from veterinarians more than three years ago now. I want to ‚Ä¶ find work in a tech field! Even if that may be <em>even more</em> impossible than it was six months ago. And, most of all, I want to revitalize my Patreon. Here‚Äôs why ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been running <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/cmdr_nova" target="_blank">my Patreon</a> since October 2014. It has been ‚Ä¶ <em>a very long time</em>. Ten years! And in that time, I‚Äôve posted downloadable releases of my <em>very first book</em> I ever self published, and then <em>two more</em> that came after. I have over twenty musical releases up, that I‚Äôve posted about over the years, and you can download <em>all of them</em> (as a paid member). I have posts containing spotlights and information about nearly <em>everything I‚Äôve ever</em> put into my Second Life store, and then I also have regular updates that include my blog posts (which have been on <em>multiple websites since then</em>).</p>

<p>There was a time when my paid subscribers reached the height of <em>thirty active subs</em>, and then, over time, I lost focus, bad things happened in the synthwave scene, and a lot of them left.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to put this out there, though: I appreciate <em>every single person</em> who has been on my Patreon, is there, and/or is even just <em>following</em> for free (except for Czarina, she was only subscribed for selfish reasons that she could later hold over my head in the midst of her retaliation to my outspoken views on the transphobia within the synthwave scene).</p>

<p>On the topic of my Patreon, though, I <em>did</em> sort of stop updating it for a little bit of 2024. I thought I could move to Ko-fi, or other sites like it, because for a while <em>it did</em> feel easier to provide updates on things I‚Äôve been doing, and creating. But ‚Ä¶ most of the sites that are <em>like</em> Patreon, are kind of also missing a lot of the features Patreon has. And ‚Ä¶ why abandon something I‚Äôve been using <em>for ten years</em>?</p>

<p>It may as well be an archive of everything I‚Äôve ever done, right?</p>

<p>I currently have a Python script running on a remote server that posts a snippet of information about my Patreon to my Mastodon account once daily, and I wanted to write this post, as well, to give a little bit of deeper insight. One of the things I was doing, that got me to where I used to be (before I returned to the offline work-world), was that I <em>shared</em> what I do, and what I create, <em>on a daily basis</em>. Sometimes <em>multiple</em> times a day.</p>

<p>Since I returned to offline work, I‚Äôve really slacked on actually sharing what I do, and I feel like that‚Äôs a big contributor as to why, <em>even with having a bestselling darksynth album</em>, I‚Äôve kind of sifted into the background noise a bit.</p>

<p>But, you should sign up to: support what I do, help me get out of this friggin‚Äô debt, and, also? Help me <em>leave retail work once and for all</em>.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the goal.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Thoughts" /><category term="blogging" /><category term="thoughts" /><category term="newyear" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy new year, everyone!

Many stay in their homes idling by themselves, or atop ‚Äúplatforms‚Äù 3000 meters up in the air, only socializing with one or two people they know personally. The virtual world has never been more disconnected as a social platform, for reasons ‚Ä¶ uh, that I‚Äôm not quite sure of. But, no need to fear! Linden Labs is alpha testing an AI character creator so that your friends can be as fake as your imagination!</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/sl-ai/creator.png" /></p>

<p>Pictured in the screenshot is a dialogue that says, ‚ÄúYour own personal bot intended to accompany you as you explore the world, bond with you, and interact mostly or only with you.‚Äù Because, it‚Äôs not like Second Life was, and has always been, a 3D virtual chat application. A place where you‚Äôre supposed to meet people, form friendships, and build together. <em>No, absolutely not.</em> This is a single-player virtual world, where the bonds you form are as contrived, meaningless, and embarrassing as asking Google‚Äôs Gemini if it loves you.</p>

<p>Introduced by Darcy Linden via an <a href="https://community.secondlife.com/blogs/entry/15954-introducing-the-character-designer-alpha/" target="_blank">official blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Developed in collaboration with Convai, the Character Designer empowers you to craft, customize, and animate virtual characters within Second Life. This tool is intended for developers, community builders, roleplay enthusiasts, and anyone looking to enhance their inworld experiences through dynamic characters. 
</blockquote>

<p>Roleplay enthusiasts! Now you don‚Äôt have to stand around in a group of five people in a city crafted by the hands of creators, writing ten paragraph long scenes for each other to immerse yourselves within while you create stories. Now, you‚Äôll be able to replace all of those people and unique moments with plagiarism bots! <strong><em>OH BOY</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Just like with any other company that has suddenly decided to force AI into their products, we can only assume that this is happening because the CEO behind Linden Labs has demanded it. And, also, in every circumstance that this has happened within in the past year, I‚Äôll ask the same question: Can we fire whoever‚Äôs responsible for this? Before it becomes the nail in the coffin that completely ruins what has been a place of discovery and friendship for <em>decades</em>?</p>

<p>Linden Labs: You want to bolster the community, reinvigorate the userbase? Take notes from VR Chat. Make creation and building <em>easier</em>. Realize that not <em>everything</em> should require a user whip out their wallet, and give new users <em>something actually cool</em>. Lower the cost of hosting your own server from 250 USD per month, to something more within the realm of sanity, at, say, 14.99 a month.</p>

<p>Or, go the desperate CEO route, and inject generative slop into Second Life. Watch it finally die, so that every person on Reddit who asks, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt Second Life dead?‚Äù can finally be correct.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Second-Life" /><category term="secondlife" /><category term="ai" /><category term="lindenlabs" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you‚Äôve spent any time in Second Life over the course of the last decade or so, you‚Äôve probably definitely noticed that more and more people are agoraphobic.

And Mark Zuckerberg continues to provide glaring examples of why that‚Äôs true. From his sanitized Second Life clone, Horizons, to the present day, with AI generated social media users.

<p>I have a complicated relationship with Meta. Like I spoke about before, in a previous post, I‚Äôve had a Facebook account since it was brand new, and even if I were to delete it, <em>they have everything about me, ever, and they‚Äôll likely never relinquish that information.</em> And, at the same time, I do tend to enjoy some mindless scrolling on Reels, or pretending that I‚Äôm a regular normal social media user on Threads, as I watch Zuck make the worst decisions possible to impress people who he has imagined in his own mind. And yes, I own a Meta Quest 2, which has been gathering dust in a drawer for about three months (VR Chat has slipped out of my zone of interest).</p>

<p>This also probably sounds extremely contrary, or in opposition to my hefty support of ActivityPub, and Mastodon, especially because I <a href="https://mkultra.monster" target="_blank"><em>run my own instance</em></a>. But, as a creator of <em>things</em>, and if you create things as well (art, fiction, etc), you already know, that you <em>must</em> maintain a presence in as many places as possible. It‚Äôs part of the game. And it‚Äôs a shitty game, that I do not enjoy.</p>

<p>But, to bring the topic back to the embedded Threads post, Zuckerberg imagines a social media where there are millions and billions of AI agents, i.e., fake people. To no one‚Äôs surprise, just about <em>every single person</em> learning of this news is asking, ‚ÄúWhat in the hell is this good for?‚Äù</p>

<p>Taken from an annoyingly milquetoast article over at <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meta-ai-users-facebook-instagram-1235221430/" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
 The prospect seems an unusual one for websites predicated on the idea of human-to-human interaction. While Meta‚Äôs other AI offerings, including photo-editing tools, a ChatGPT-like text bot, and forthcoming software for producing AI-generated video, have more readily obvious appeal, it‚Äôs far from certain that an Instagram or Facebook populated by virtual apparitions would prove enticing to newcomers or satisfying for long-time users. Meta revealed to FT that users have created ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of characters‚Äù since AI Studio launched in July, but that most of them remain private. The company declined to comment further to Rolling Stone. 
</blockquote>

<p>The question remains: What <em>value</em> does this provide? You‚Äôre melting the ice caps in order to put fake people on social media, that you‚Äôre <em>already aware people don‚Äôt like</em>, for <strong>what reason</strong>? Are you going to sell people AI blocking software as a solution to a problem that you yourselves have created? Is that the end goal here?</p>

<p>You see, I come from the 90s. And in the 90s, we had very, <em>very</em> primitive chatbots. Chatbots that responded to trigger words with predefined text. This is something that you can now build by yourself with like 5 minutes of Python. Hardly anyone thought it was cool then, and it definitely isn‚Äôt cool now.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not cool, because <em>most people</em> are online and on social media, to meet, and talk to <em>real</em> people. To make friends. To make connections. <em>What</em> connection are you making with an AI ghost on Facebook?</p>

<p>Am I missing a piece of the human genome that makes something like this exciting?</p>

<p>I must be.</p>

<p>You can go and see one of these ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù on Facebook, now. And, if you‚Äôre feeling extra funny, you can use Facebook‚Äôs <em>own reporting tools</em> to report the entire account for being a <strong>fake person</strong>. It‚Äôs literally there, in the reporting dialogue.</p>

If we can move the digital world to ActivityPub, on user-owned servers, then maybe artists, and writers, and musicians can feel like they don‚Äôt have to be on these data farms anymore, just to gamble and get a 10% boost in exposure while bots are scraping everything they say so that AI generated Jimmy Carter can say, ‚ÄúHey John, did you buy that Apple Watch you were talking about yesterday?‚Äù</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Tech" /><category term="socialmedia" /><category term="tech" /><category term="meta" /><category term="ai" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We‚Äôve all recently come to the conclusion that billionaires and CEOs don‚Äôt really care what you think of them, or what they do.

And, keeping within the theme of traveling back in time to the world of Tumblr fandoms and Gamergate, it‚Äôs time we switched gears to the once growing ‚Äútrans exclusionary radical feminist‚Äù movement, and the spectrum of hate and transphobia that came with it. Today, we‚Äôre talking about a book that was published in 2014, called <em>Adam</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/bechdel/adam.jpg" /></p>

<p>The synopsis is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
When Adam Freedman ‚Äî a skinny, awkward, inexperienced teenager from Piedmont, California ‚Äî goes to stay with his older sister Casey in New York City, he is hopeful that his life is about to change. And it sure does.<br /><br />

It is the summer of 2006. Gay marriage and transgender rights are in the air, and Casey has thrust herself into a wild lesbian subculture. Soon Adam is tagging along to underground clubs, where there are hot older women everywhere he turns. It takes some time for him to realize that many in this new crowd assume he is trans‚Äîa boy who was born a girl. Why else would this baby-faced guy always be around?<br /><br />

Then Adam meets Gillian, the girl of his dreams ‚Äî but she couldn‚Äôt possibly be interested in him. Unless passing as a trans guy might actually work in his favor . . .<br /><br />

Ariel Schrag‚Äôs scathingly funny and poignant debut novel puts a fresh spin on questions of love, attraction, self-definition, and what it takes to be at home in your own skin.
</blockquote>

<p>This had a movie accompanying it that released in 2019, wherein the <em>extremely flawed</em> premise of a guy pretending to be trans in order to sleep with a lesbian caught fire like a volcano on Twitter (and you may also note, the premise describes Adam as a <em>teenager</em>).</p>

<p>And then it was summarily forgotten in about a week.</p>

<p>These themes and premises <em>also</em> align with things TERFs believe, or talk about. But, it‚Äôs been so long since these types have really seen the light of day, at least, in the way they <em>did</em> back in 2014 across the earlier versions of the sites we‚Äôre all stuck on (well, maybe not stuck). You can read more about who they are and what they believe, <a href="https://nwlc.org/happy-pride-dont-be-a-terf/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>And, <em>maybe</em> this book isn‚Äôt exclusively anything to <em>do</em> with trans exclusionary radfems, but it‚Äôs definitely in the spaces of something that sits in the same arena as, ‚Äúmen wearing dresses pretending to be women entering spaces where they don‚Äôt belong,‚Äù except, in this instance, the role is reversed. The role is reversed, and it places transgender men in a light wherein they <em>have something in common with lesbians</em>, therein aligning them as <em>women who look and act like men.</em></p>

<p>Obviously, this isn‚Äôt <em>good</em>, or excusable, to write a story where something like this is painted as fun, uplifting, and ‚Äúliberating.‚Äù Transphobia is literally the gasoline that‚Äôs fueling the modern fascist movement. And pretending that trans men are just women, whom‚Äôst lesbians can be interested in, romantically and sexually involved with, <em>is both transphobic and homophobic.</em> At least ‚Ä¶ if you actually align yourself with transgender people, in that they are who they say they are.</p>

<p>Now, stay with me here, what‚Äôs that quote at the top of the book‚Äôs cover read? Did you see that?</p>

<blockquote>
"The sexual revolution is finally over, and Ariel Schrag has won." - Alison Bechdel
</blockquote>

<p>Who‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel" target="_blank">Alison Bechdel</a>, though?</p>

<p>During the emergence of Gamergate, there was also a lot of talk about representation in gaming and other media, specifically about how women are represented and written. In that, they‚Äôre usually written <em>badly</em>, and usually to the benefit of a male character, for the male reader‚Äôs personal sexual ‚Äúgaze‚Äù or enjoyment.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre an older netizen like myself, you may remember Anita Sarkeesian and the extreme amount of vitriol she faced <em>whenever she talked about these things</em>, usually, specifically, in relation to gaming. You may also remember Zoe Quinn, whom is thought to be where, why, and <em>how</em> Gamergate ‚Äústarted,‚Äù i.e., in backlash <em>against her.</em> You can read much more about all of that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/09/24/349835297/-gamergate-controversy-fuels-debate-on-women-and-video-games" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>But then, there also emerged a guideline of sorts that served and <em>still serves</em> as a litmus test for gauging old, new, and upcoming media for their literacy in representing women.</p>

<p>This test is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" target="_blank">The Bechdel Test</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
The Bechdel test (/Ààb…õkd…ôl/ BEK-d…ôl),[1] also known as the Bechdel-Wallace test, is a measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction. The test asks whether a work features at least two female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. Some versions of the test also require that those two female characters have names.
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm not saying this ‚Äútest‚Äù of sorts doesn‚Äôt have any merit. There is <em>a lot</em> of merit in gauging these things, and determining if media is <em>actually good</em>, especially in this day and age, where Bad Things are getting <em>more bad</em>. But, I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on why someone who gave such an endorsement, to such a terrible piece of media, that <em>absolutely betrays her own test</em>, women, and the entire trans community, and was so proud of it, that it was <strong>featured on the front of the book</strong> ‚Ä¶ is still being celebrated.</p>

<p>And I wanted to <em>finally</em> bring a more permanent light to this, because I‚Äôve been talking about it <em>for a decade</em>, to an internet that forgets everything it thinks it cares about faster than the speed of light, and I‚Äôve been doing that on social media websites like, Twitter, Bluesky, Tumblr, <em>all this time</em>. And, whether you think I belong to any community or not doesn‚Äôt matter. It matters that critical thinking doesn‚Äôt die, and it matters more that we consider those we‚Äôre promoting and uplifting.</p>

<p>Alison Bechdel isn‚Äôt special. She‚Äôs just as flawed as any of us, and maybe she‚Äôs not <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cathy_Brennan" target="_blank">Cathy Brennan</a>, but <em>maybe we can think of a new name for litmus testing media for actual interesting female characters</em>, that doesn‚Äôt involve the name of someone who endorsed media where a man pretends to be transgender in order to sleep with a lesbian.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="LGBTQ" /><category term="bechdel" /><category term="bechdeltest" /><category term="lgbtq" /><category term="gamergate" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A long time ago, in an age far, far away ‚Ä¶ Ten years ago, to be exact.

But I was there (and this is why I say that Twitter was <em>never actually good</em>), and I remember what the discourse and shitposting looked like. And it looked ‚Ä¶ a lot like what we‚Äôre seeing today, when new games are announced, and it‚Äôs starring a woman. Words have evolved a bit, since then, and we mostly call these guys incels. But, what‚Äôs the problem now? What games are the never-gonna-get-laid guys worried about?</p>

<p>First, we have The Witcher 4, where Ciri will be taking up the lead role.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/gamergate/ciri.jpg" /></p>

<p>Pretty awesome right? The best character in The Witcher 3 is getting her own <em>game</em>? Frick yeah, bro!</p>

<p>But, this is, apparently, a problem now?</p>

<p>These people don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúplay as a woman‚Äù, or they think Ciri looks <em>old</em> now. Honestly, I think she looks like she‚Äôs in her thirties, and that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ uh, fine?</p>

<p>CD Project Red addressed these people, and I think even their response is a bit too tame for my liking. Quoted via <a href="https://gamerant.com/witcher-4-ciri-protagonist-concerns-complaints/" target="_blank">Gamerant</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Regarding those fans who simply don't want to play as a woman, the narrative director noted that the lore of The Witcher 4 will continue to follow the dark fantasy themes already present in the series. He pointed out that past games have addressed tough times for marginalized groups, such as non-humans, and said while Ciri's gender will play a factor in the story, it won't be the main focus.
</blockquote>

<p>And, in order to back up what I‚Äôm talking about, I had to go dig up an example of the bile from Twitter, because I don‚Äôt inherently save screenshots of every nasty thing I see online. But, I mean, this is what I‚Äôm talking about, that CDPR very luke-warm-ish, are addressing:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the shills are out hyping up Witcher 4. All the honest people saw they made the main character a woman who breaks lore in her new role AND who was made significantly uglier than she used to be. Both are red flags for an extremely woke game. <a href="https://t.co/tVPRkssFBT">pic.twitter.com/tVPRkssFBT</a></p>&mdash; Mr. Reality (@MrReality_sp) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrReality_sp/status/1867432878331580463?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It‚Äôs true, some people might be uncomfortable with Geralt giving up the helm to the series, but also? This woman isn‚Äôt ugly? I mean, I would never go so far as to call <em>anyone</em> ugly, because bla bla bla, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But, if we‚Äôre talking brass tacks here: Ciri is hot, and very not ‚Äúugly.‚Äù</p>

<p>The biggest thing I‚Äôm worried about in regard to Witcher 4, is <em>whether or not it‚Äôs going to be a buggy mess on launch.</em></p>

<p>And this isn‚Äôt even <em>close</em> to the backlash Last of Us game director‚Äôs next new IP is receiving. Yes, you‚Äôve probably heard about this already. It‚Äôs probably all over every feed you visit on a daily basis.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNaughty Dog‚Äôs new game starring a woman or nonbinary person, who is bald and sips a soda, now has larger dislike ratio than Concord.‚Äù</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of space and scifi games. Not sure I‚Äôm a fan of hack and slash as much though, <em>unless we‚Äôre talking Diablo</em>. I love Diablo.</p>

<p>But, again, the shitcourse continues. This actually took me more than <em>ten minutes to find</em>, on <strong>Twitter</strong>, which says to me that the backlash may be slightly manufactured. And this <em>isn‚Äôt even the worst thing</em> I‚Äôve seen being said (maybe I <em>do</em> need to start saving screenshots of the nasty bile people spew about games and women within them):</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, <em>maybe</em> Intergalactic will just be an unfun game, or <em>maybe</em> it‚Äôll be a new classic! I don‚Äôt know. What I <em>do</em> know, is that a character‚Äôs appearance, like, physical appearance, has never been the reason that a game has failed or succeeded.</p>

<p>Do you know why Mass Effect Andromeda bombed? It wasn‚Äôt because <a href="https://bsn.boards.net/thread/10115/facial-changes-default-annoying-incoming" target="_blank">Sara Ryder wasn‚Äôt wearing pink lipstick</a>. It wasn‚Äôt because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/61fv3x/no_spoiler_why_do_people_think_peebee_is_ugly/" target="_blank">Peebee</a> didn‚Äôt resemble Liara enough.</p>

<p>It was because <em>these same types of mother-frikkers</em> rallied against the game for having <em>very very</em> slight mentions of transgender-related themes, and some flubs in animations that somehow made it past QA. And because these types operate in crypto-fascist, hide-the-motive style of language, and posting, it was painted as an issue with the game, overall, just <em>not working and being bad in-general</em>. Some <em>even went so far</em> as to <em>edit</em> footage from the early game, before its release, in order to manipulate public perception of it.</p>

<p>You may have seen things like this on Tumblr and Twitter back in 2017 (and no, there is no way I‚Äôm going to be able to find reference for this anymore, especially since Tumblr staff <em>nuked my account</em>). Choppy cuts in video form of animations that appear to be backwards or wrong, in every cut, unless you had a good eye, and could see where images and cutscenes were being misrepresented. I‚Äôm talking intentionally slowing down silence between narrative, cutting back and forth between multiple characters in the midst of a conversation to give the appearance of amateur design.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm <em>still mad</em> about this, because it was <em>this backlash</em>, this manipulation of perception, that <em>caused</em> BioWare to abandon the game shortly after release, and <em>immediately</em> jump to work on the <em>also now abandoned</em>, Anthem.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> issue with Andromeda, was that a lot of the game‚Äôs polish was sacrificed to make pointlessly open-ended planets that were <em>far too large</em>. That‚Äôs it. It was actually an alright game, if you ignored that part.</p>

<p>But, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs diverse characters that are or will destroy the gaming industry. I think it‚Äôs these guys. I think the smoldering remains of gamergate, or <em>incels</em>, as most would say, are going to singlehandedly kill the entire industry. Much the same way they‚Äôve killed Twitter, alongside their new boss, Felon Busk. We can‚Äôt just have games with women in them. We can‚Äôt just have games where making sure a chronically online right-wing extremist has masturbatory material isn‚Äôt the main goal. No.</p>

<p>Nuh uh.</p>

<p>Every game has to be fappable to people who have bad taste in beauty aesthetics, or it‚Äôs the gaming apocalypse.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Gaming" /><category term="gaming" /><category term="gamergate" /><category term="gamingnews" /><category term="intergalactic" /><category term="thewitcher4" /><category term="masseffectandromeda" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people weren‚Äôt around for what happened in 2014, and the ‚Äúinitialization‚Äù of ‚Äúgamergate‚Äù that would, seemingly, never go away (see this link for more information).

It kinda sucked. The text bled off of the page, there was no pagination, and the result querying was live, which also didn‚Äôt look good.

<p>If you look up to the top right (on desktop), you‚Äôll see in the secondary sidebar there‚Äôs now a search field. Since I have very <em>many</em> posts on this site, and there‚Äôs only going to be more, <em>now</em> you can just type in something interesting, like ‚Äúlinux,‚Äù and you‚Äôll get everything I‚Äôve ever written on here that includes the phrase.</p>

<p>Genius!</p>

<p>It actually works kind of in the same way my ‚Äúpoast to mastodon‚Äù script works, for when I publish new posts, except it‚Äôs not posting to Mastodon, and it is instead generating URLs for search results regarding <em>every single post</em> on this site, each time I build and serve, locally.</p>

<p>Now, it‚Äôs not as robust and broken, and also horrible as Google. There‚Äôs no AI interrupting to give you weird hallucinated interruptions. Just pure ‚Ä¶ uh, text written by me.</p>

<p>Whoop whoop.</p>]]></content><author><name>êï£ C M D R ‚ñë NOVA êï£</name></author><category term="Webdev" /><category term="webdev" /><category term="design" /><category term="html" /><category term="website" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while back I had a real shoddy, and not-so-well integrated search function on my website.
