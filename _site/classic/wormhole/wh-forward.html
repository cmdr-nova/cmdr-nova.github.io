  You find yourself staring down a black empty void of nothing. There are no stars anywhere that you can see, and as far as you can tell, there is no oxygen either. Although you can tell you're alive, you can't quite feel anything. The darkness beckons and grips hold of your breath in its icy grasp.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  You try to move your arms and legs around and your extremeties seem to knock against something hard. Your head feels like it's coming out of a deep sleep of sorts, and you begin to gain feeling at the tips of your fingers. Steel slides against your skin, crushing down atop your body. You try to push, and it feels almost as though your enclosure might give way.
